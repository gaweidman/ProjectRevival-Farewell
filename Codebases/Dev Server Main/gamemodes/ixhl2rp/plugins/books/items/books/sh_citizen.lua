<h1>How to Roleplay as a citizen</h1>
<h3>By Shooter</h3>



<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Welcome to our lovely server, if you are finding our discord first it
is recommended to read this before joining the server. If you are already
on the server then… By the end of this guide we hope that you have a 
general understanding of how to roleplay as a citizen and not end up 
being a loner sitting in the corner not talking to anyone.
</p>

<h2>Individuals</h2>
<p>
City Administrator - Individual who serves the combine but also oversees it, 
They work for the combine and act as a leader for the city below him, creating 
rules that uphold the thoughts of their benefactors. This individual tends 
to advocate for the combine and acts as a figurehead for it.  
</p>

<p>
Loyalist/Collaborators - Individuals who see the combine not as an oppressive 
force but as a general force like any other. These individuals tend to leave 
the Combine to their own mists. They will also assist the combine whenever 
needed, reporting contraband and or helping work. 
</p>
<p>
Civil Workers - Individuals who work for a living, there either always 
participate in workshifts or work directly with the combine, under an 
umbrella union. These individuals tend to stick to their own merits 
and or attempt to get money from their work.
</p>
<p>
Civil Protection - Individuals who directly want to be responsible for 
helping the Combine. They indoctrinate themselves into the Combine and 
act as a messenger for the combined wants. These individuals tend to affect 
others performing actions to make the Combine seem the best, and will 
act out the wills of the Combine.
</p>
<p>
Citizen - Individuals who live their own lives under the umbrella 
of the combine. They live their lives simple but healthy, They live 
in their homes, go to work and or workshifts, and get rations. These 
individuals simply want to live, nothing more nothing less.
</p>
<p>
Refugees - Individuals who want to assist a resistance, but still wish to 
live a normal life in safety. They will go to the slums and or rebel outposts to 
interact with the resistance, but won’t go into active combat with the resistance. 
These individuals want change from the combine, but also wish to have a roof over their head.
</p>
<p>
Resistance - Individuals who see the Combine as the enemy and wish to 
eradicate them from the planet. They have given up normal life within 
the city and or city walls to help combat the Combine. These individuals 
want to remove the combine, and as such will do everything in their power 
to eradicate them, ranging from fighting the combine to defending against the combine.
</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>
After you have finished your character creation you are thrusted into the Half Life 2 univers.
As a new character (and potentially new player) you need to get a foothold of where you are 
in and what you want to do, and for some it defaults to become Gorden Freeman, 
But there are many things you can do, some popular paths are:
</p>
<p>
Enjoy a normal civic life</p>
<p>
Basically get into the city, find a civil protection unit and ask them for housing. 
They will provide you with a housing block and then you can move in with the many 
others who live with you. After a while you get your rations and maybe perform some work. 
Making friends along the way and having a great laugh as you go along. 
It’s a simple life but it’s an honest one.
</p>
<p>
Join/assist the Resistance, fight for what you think is right</p>
<p>
Those who solely believe combines are terrible, should unify and fight for what they think is right.
 Get some friends together or not and fight the combine. Make your name known, have it be feared by 
 many and envied by some, grow your cult following until the combine has no control of the city and they must leave.
</p>
<p>
Advocate for the combine, Become a collaborator</p>
<p>
In principle those who are bad are punished but on the other side those who act good are rewarded. 
You want to do all the good you can. Whenever you find something that is out of place or that does 
conform to the combine report it. But reporting is not all you can do to assist the combine, work 
the hardest in workshifts, save lives, and it all will be rewarded. 
</p>
<p>
Serve in a Union, Become apart of the CWU</p>
<p>
You act as a working body, and eventually you want to work under a collective with the protection 
and guidance from our benefactors. You specialise either becoming a merchant, an industrial worker, 
a medical professional, or a scientific decovier (soon™). You excel at your specialty, 
you grow the ranks and eventually oversee many.
</p>
<p>
Serve our benefactors, become a civil protection officer </p>
<p>
You start off as a simple individual who has a suit and is allowed in the nexus, but soon you 
become trained in the ways of a civil protection officer. You're rusty at first mostly using 
common dialect when speaking and relying on your superiors for help, but soon you get into a rhythm. 
You grow in the ranks protecting the patrons in the city and removing those who attempt to be chaotic. 
Eventually you get to live in peace on your off time as you molded this world.
</p>
<h2>
Forms of Roleplay</h2>
<p>
Throughout your time on the server you may come to a stand still of what to do. At times it can 
feel a little lack lister having no goal in mind. But there is always something you can do.
They come in two flavors: Passive RP and Active RP and each has their own things you can do.
</p>
<p>
Passive Roleplay </p>
<p>
Passive Roleplay is going through your day, and or going from 
point A to point B, Little roleplay that impacts the whole server will 
happen at this time. But it will also build on you as a person this can be 
talking with people, walking and or running, crafting an item, etc.
</p>
<p>
Active Roleplay</p>
<p>
Active Roleplay is actively doing something with a conscious thought. 
This roleplay can affect the whole server in some ways. This is not only a world building Roleplay 
but also a character building Roleplay. This may range from Starting a gun fight, 
Getting into a fist fight, Going to the bar, Going to a store, Participating a workshift, etc.
</p>
<p>
Talking with people</p>
<p>
At the end of the day you are human and us humans are social and subsequently need to interact 
with one another. This could range from talking about life in the city to their future plans, 
at the end of it all you may develop a healthy relationship with both the character and the player.
Just because your an introvert in the Real world don't mean you have to be one in this world.
</p>
<p>
Scavenge </p>
<p>
If there are enough players online then items will randomly spawn around the map, a select 
few of these items are illegal, but a fair few of them can be useful. A few of these items can 
be used for crafting, but it is unlikely that you solely will have all the materials required 
to make an item, so trade, talk, craft with others for these items.
</p>
<p>
Perform work</p>
<p>
On occasion Civil Protection officers will be tasked with forming a workshift, when this happens 
take advantage of it. Join in the work and at the end you will get rewarded with loyalty points and tokens.
</p>
<p>
Collect your ration</p>
<p>
Your ration contains basic living essentials like food, water and money. This will 
slowly enable you to buy things that will advance you on your final goal.
</p>
<p>
Create a commotion </p>
<p>
Maybe you want something done now, and a lot of people will notice you from it, or create 
a problem that Civil Protection will have to deal with. Whether that be yelling in the 
plaza, or attacking an officer anything goes.
</p>
<p>
Praying to a god</p>
<p>
Maybe your characters have a little bit of hope in them, and they want to go to a controgation 
of people who share the same thoughts. At the end of the day if it gives you hope then do it.
</p>
<h2>
Combat
</h2>
<p>
In simple terms combat is getting into a confrontation between two parts where either part 
has to forcelly attack or defend the other. Generally there is a default system to combat 
but if both parties allow it then anything can happen.
</p>
<p>
Script/Weapon Combat</p>
<p>
This is the simplest form of RP. It is frowned upon by experienced roleplayers, but is 
generally the most fun. This involves using Garry’s mod weapons for combat, that be pistols 
or fist as long as it’s a fight it works out. This does have sub-categories to this.
</p>
<p>
Shoot to kill (S2K)</p>
<p>
This means as it says, weapons are used to their full capacity with no drawbacks. This is 
recommended for extremely long distances in which other forms are generally not viable. 
This doesn't include faction advantages which may favor S2K.
</p>
<p>
Shoot to miss (S2M)</p>
<p>
When performing S2M players are to generally refrain from directly aiming at the target, 
but It could be possible, With S2M the intended goal is to have either part at a stand still. 
Players are recommended to shoot at the points so the other party can’t perform an action and likewise.
</p>
<p>
Shoot to roll (S2R)</p>
<p>
This is a preferred form of RP for a few. Both parties perform an action and whichever party 
gets a high roll gets to use their script as an action. It’s recommended to hit in the chest 
for practicality. This is favored for Melee combat or small arms combat.  
Example: </p>
<p> 	[E]CP:C45.APEX.RT.312 throws a right hook at the man's jaw.
<p> 	Jason Carter throws a jab into the unit's chest.
<p> 	[E]CP:C45.APEX.RT.312 has rolled a 13 out of 100
<p>     Jason Carter has rolled a 47 out of 100
<p>     [E]CP:C45.APEX.RT.312 misses
<p>     Jason Carter hits
<p>     [E]CP:C45.APEX.RT.312 took 5 points of damage from weapon_fist

<p>
Play to lose (P2L)</p>
<p>
This is a more experienced form of combat due to both parties being forced to gauge whether 
logically they would be able to do something. But in general P2L involves both parties taking 
turns to attack the other and the receiving parties lose to action.
    Example: </p>
<p> 	CP:C45.APEX.RL.612 throws a right hook at the man's jaw.</p>
<p> 	Matt Bia is thrown aside at the right hook connecting with his jaw.</p>

<p>
Play to roll (P2R)</p>
<p>
This is an intermediary form of combat where both parties generally have a random change in getting and action.
This works regardless of if the dice are d20s or d100s. Generally both parties perform an action 
whichever party has the higher role their action is successful. Some factions have advantages to 
their rolls which means they get a certain amount added to their roll when performing and action.
Example: </p>
<p> 	[M]CP:C15.UNION.RT.312 throws a right hook at the person’s jaw.</p>
<p> 	Aylx Days throws a jab into the unit's chest.</p>
<p> 	[M]CP:C15.UNION.RT.312: Rolled a 5 out of 100</p>
<p> 	Aylx Days: Rolled a 20 out of 100</p>
<p> 	[M]CP:C15.UNION.RT.312 feels his chest compress as the jab hits him square in the chest</p>
