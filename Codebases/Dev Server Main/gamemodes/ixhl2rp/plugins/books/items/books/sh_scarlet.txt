As the public disapprobationwould weigh very heavily on him, were he consciousof deserving it, the author begs leave to say, that hehas carefully read over the introductory pages, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>purpose to alter or expunge whatever might be foundamiss, and to make the best reparation in his powerfor the atrocities of which he has been adjudged guilty.But it appears to him, that the only remarkable featuresof the sketch are its frank and genuine good-humor,and the general accuracy with which he hasconveyed his sincere impressions of the characterstherein described. As to enmity, or ill-feeling of anykind, personal or political, he utterly disclaims suchmotives. The sketch might, perhaps, have been whollyomitted, without loss to the public, or detriment tothe book; but, having undertaken to write it, he conceivesthat it could not have been done in a better ora kindlier spirit, nor, so far as his abilities availed, witha livelier effect of truth.</p><p>The author is constrained, therefore, to republish hisintroductory sketch without the change of a

The first time was three or four yearssince, when I favored the reader—inexcusably, and for noearthly reason, that either the indulgent reader or the intrusiveauthor could imagine—with a description of my way of life inthe deep quietude of an Old Manse. And now—because, beyondmy deserts, I was happy enough to find a listener or twoon the former occasion—I again seize the public by the button,and talk of my three years' experience in a Custom-House. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>example of the famous “P.&nbsp;P., Clerk of this Parish,” was nevermore faithfully followed. The truth seems to be, however, that,when he casts his leaves forth upon the wind, the author addresses,not the many who will fling aside his volume, or nevertake it up, but the few who will understand him, better thanmost of his schoolmates or lifemates. Some authors, indeed, dofar more than this, and indulge themselves in such confidentialdepths of revelation as could fittingly be addressed, only andexclusively, to the one heart and mind of perfect sympathy; asif the printed book, thrown at large on the wide world, werecertain to find out the divided segment of the writer's ownnature, and complete his circle of existence by bringing himinto communion with it. It is scarcely decorous, however, tospeak all, even where we speak impersonally. But, as thoughtsare frozen and utterance benumbed, unless the speaker stand insome true relation with his audience, it may be pardonable toimagine that a friend, a kind and apprehensive, though not theclosest friend, is listening to our talk; and then, a native reservebeing thawed by this genial consciousness, we may prateof the circumstances that lie around us, and even of ourself,but still keep the inmost Me behind its veil. To this extent,and within these limits, an author, methinks, may be autobiographical,without violating either the reader's rights or hisown.</p><p>It will be seen, likewise, that this Custom-House sketch hasa certain propriety, of a kind always recognized in literature, asexplaining how a large portion of the following pages came intomy possession, and as offering proofs of the authenticity of anarrative therein contained. This, in fact,—a desire to putmyself in my true position as editor, or very little more, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>most prolix among the tales that make up my volume,—this,and no other, is my true reason for assuming a personal relationwith the public. In accomplishing the main purpose, it hasappeared allowable, by a few extra touches, to give a faint representationof a mode of life not heretofore described, togetherwith some of the characters that move in it, among whom theauthor happened to make one.</p><p style="padding-top: 2em">In my native town of Salem, at the head of what, half a centuryago, in the days of old King Derby, was a bustling wharf,—butwhich is now burdened with decayed wooden warehouses,and exhibits few or no symptoms of commercial life; except,perhaps, a bark or brig, half-way down its melancholy length,discharging hides; or, nearer at hand, a Nova Scotia schooner,pitching out her cargo of firewood,—at the head, I say, of thisdilapidated wharf, which the tide often overflows, and alongwhich, at the base and in the rear of the row of buildings, thetrack of many languid years is seen in a border of unthriftygrass,—here, with a view from its front windows adown thisnot very enlivening prospect, and thence across the harbor, standsa spacious edifice of brick. From the loftiest point of its roof,during precisely three and a half hours of each forenoon, floatsor droops, in breeze or calm, the banner of the republic; butwith the thirteen stripes turned vertically, instead of horizontally,and thus indicating that a civil, and not a military post of UncleSam's government is here established. Its front is ornamentedwith a portico of half a dozen wooden pillars, supporting a balcony,beneath which a flight of wide granite steps descendstowards the street. Over the entrance hovers an enormous specimenof the American eagle, with outspread wings, a shield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>before her breast, and, if I recollect aright, a bunch of intermingledthunderbolts and barbed arrows in each claw. Withthe customary infirmity of temper that characterizes this unhappyfowl, she appears, by the fierceness of her beak and eye, and thegeneral truculency of her attitude, to threaten mischief to theinoffensive community; and especially to warn all citizens, carefulof their safety, against intruding on the premises which sheovershadows with her wings. Nevertheless, vixenly as she looks,many people are seeking, at this very moment, to shelter themselvesunder the wing of the federal eagle; imagining, I presume,that her bosom has all the softness and snugness of aneider-down pillow. But she has no great tenderness, even inher best of moods, and, sooner or later,—oftener soon thanlate,—is apt to fling off her nestlings, with a scratch of herclaw, a dab of her beak, or a rankling wound from her barbedarrows.</p><p>The pavement round about the above-described edifice—whichwe may as well name at once as the Custom-House of the port—hasgrass enough growing in its chinks to show that it has not,of late days, been worn by any multitudinous resort of business.In some months of the year, however, there often chances a forenoonwhen affairs move onward with a livelier tread. Such occasionsmight remind the elderly citizen of that period before thelast war with England, when Salem was a port by itself; notscorned, as she is now, by her own merchants and ship-owners,who permit her wharves to crumble to ruin, while their venturesgo to swell, needlessly and imperceptibly, the mighty flood ofcommerce at New York or Boston. On some such morning,when three or four vessels happen to have arrived at once,—usuallyfrom Africa or South America,—or to be on the verge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>of their departure thitherward, there is a sound of frequent feet,passing briskly up and down the granite steps. Here, before hisown wife has greeted him, you may greet the sea-flushed shipmaster,just in port, with his vessel's papers under his arm, ina tarnished tin box. Here, too, comes his owner, cheerful orsombre, gracious or in the sulks, accordingly as his scheme ofthe now accomplished voyage has been realized in merchandisethat will readily be turned to gold, or has buried him under abulk of incommodities, such as nobody will care to rid him of.Here, likewise,—the germ of the wrinkle-browed, grizzly-bearded,care-worn merchant,—we have the smart young clerk, who getsthe taste of traffic as a wolf-cub does of blood, and already sendsadventures in his master's ships, when he had better be sailingmimic-boats upon a mill-pond. Another figure in the scene isthe outward-bound sailor in quest of a protection; or the recentlyarrived one, pale and feeble, seeking a passport to thehospital. Nor must we forget the captains of the rusty littleschooners that bring firewood from the British provinces; arough-looking set of tarpaulins, without the alertness of theYankee aspect, but contributing an item of no slight importanceto our decaying trade.</p><p>Cluster all these individuals together, as they sometimes were,with other miscellaneous ones to diversify the group, and, forthe time being, it made the Custom-House a stirring scene. Morefrequently, however, on ascending the steps, you would discern—inthe entry, if it were summer time, or in their appropriate rooms,if wintry or inclement weather—a row of venerable figures, sittingin old-fashioned chairs, which were tipped on their hindlegs back against the wall. Oftentimes they were asleep, butoccasionally might be heard talking together, in voices between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>speech and a snore, and with that lack of energy that distinguishesthe occupants of almshouses, and all other human beingswho depend for subsistence on charity, on monopolized labor,or anything else, but their own independent exertions. Theseold gentlemen—seated, like Matthew, at the receipt of customs,but not very liable to be summoned thence, like him, for apostolicerrands—were Custom-House officers.</p><p>Furthermore, on the left hand as you enter the front door, isa certain room or office, about fifteen feet square, and of a loftyheight; with two of its arched windows commanding a view ofthe aforesaid dilapidated wharf, and the third looking across anarrow lane, and along a portion of Derby Street. All threegive glimpses of the shops of grocers, block-makers, slop-sellers,and ship-chandlers; around the doors of which are generally tobe seen, laughing and gossiping, clusters of old salts, and suchother wharf-rats as haunt the Wapping of a seaport. The roomitself is cobwebbed, and dingy with old paint; its floor is strewnwith gray sand, in a fashion that has elsewhere fallen into longdisuse; and it is easy to conclude, from the general slovenlinessof the place, that this is a sanctuary into which womankind,with her tools of magic, the broom and mop, has very infrequentaccess. In the way of furniture, there is a stove witha voluminous funnel; an old pine desk, with a three-leggedstool beside it; two or three wooden-bottom chairs, exceedinglydecrepit and infirm; and—not to forget the library—on someshelves, a score or two of volumes of the Acts of Congress, anda bulky Digest of the Revenue Laws. A tin pipe ascends throughthe ceiling, and forms a medium of vocal communication withother parts of the edifice. And here, some six months ago,—pacingfrom corner to corner, or lounging on the long-legged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>stool, with his elbow on the desk, and his eyes wandering upand down the columns of the morning newspaper,—you mighthave recognized, honored reader, the same individual who welcomedyou into his cheery little study, where the sunshine glimmeredso pleasantly through the willow branches, on the westernside of the Old Manse. But now, should you go thither to seekhim, you would inquire in vain for the Locofoco Surveyor. Thebesom of reform has swept him out of office; and a worthiersuccessor wears his dignity, and pockets his emoluments.</p><p>This old town of Salem—my native place, though I havedwelt much away from it, both in boyhood and maturer years—possesses,or did possess, a hold on my affections, the forceof which I have never realized during my seasons of actual residencehere. Indeed, so far as its physical aspect is concerned,with its flat, unvaried surface, covered chiefly with wooden houses,few or none of which pretend to architectural beauty,—itsirregularity, which is neither picturesque nor quaint, but onlytame,—its long and lazy street, lounging wearisomely throughthe whole extent of the peninsula, with Gallows Hill and NewGuinea at one end, and a view of the almshouse at the other,—suchbeing the features of my native town, it would be quiteas reasonable to form a sentimental attachment to a disarrangedchecker-board. And yet, though invariably happiest elsewhere,there is within me a feeling for old Salem, which, in lack of abetter phrase, I must be content to call affection. The sentimentis probably assignable to the deep and aged roots whichmy family has struck into the soil. It is now nearly two centuriesand a quarter since the original Briton, the earliest emigrantof my name, made his appearance in the wild and forest-borderedsettlement, which has since become a city. And here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>his descendants have been born and died, and have mingled theirearthy substance with the soil; until no small portion of it mustnecessarily be akin to the mortal frame wherewith, for a littlewhile, I walk the streets. In part, therefore, the attachmentwhich I speak of is the mere sensuous sympathy of dust fordust. Few of my countrymen can know what it is; nor, asfrequent transplantation is perhaps better for the stock, needthey consider it desirable to know.</p><p>But the sentiment has likewise its moral quality. The figureof that first ancestor, invested by family tradition with a dimand dusky grandeur, was present to my boyish imagination, asfar back as I can remember. It still haunts me, and inducesa sort of home-feeling with the past, which I scarcely claim inreference to the present phase of the town. I seem to have astronger claim to a residence here on account of this grave,bearded, sable-cloaked and steeple-crowned progenitor,—whocame so early, with his Bible and his sword, and trode theunworn street with such a stately port, and made so large afigure, as a man of war and peace,—a stronger claim than formyself, whose name is seldom heard and my face hardly known.He was a soldier, legislator, judge; he was a ruler in the Church;he had all the Puritanic traits, both good and evil. He waslikewise a bitter persecutor, as witness the Quakers, who haveremembered him in their histories, and relate an incident of hishard severity towards a woman of their sect, which will lastlonger, it is to be feared, than any record of his better deeds,although these were many. His son, too, inherited the persecutingspirit, and made himself so conspicuous in the martyrdomof the witches, that their blood may fairly be said to haveleft a stain upon him. So deep a stain, indeed, that his old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>dry bones, in the Charter Street burial-ground, must still retainit, if they have not crumbled utterly to dust! I know notwhether these ancestors of mine bethought themselves to repent,and ask pardon of Heaven for their cruelties; or whether theyare now groaning under the heavy consequences of them, inanother state of being. At all events, I, the present writer,as their representative, hereby take shame upon myself for theirsakes, and pray that any curse incurred by them—as I haveheard, and as the dreary and unprosperous condition of therace, for many a long year back, would argue to exist—maybe now and henceforth removed.</p><p>Doubtless, however, either of these stern and black-browedPuritans would have thought it quite a sufficient retribution forhis sins, that, after so long a lapse of years, the old trunk ofthe family tree, with so much venerable moss upon it, shouldhave borne, as its topmost bough, an idler like myself. Noaim, that I have ever cherished, would they recognize as laudable;no success of mine—if my life, beyond its domesticscope, had ever been brightened by success—would they deemotherwise than worthless, if not positively disgraceful. “Whatis he?” murmurs one gray shadow of my forefathers to theother. “A writer of story-books! What kind of a businessin life—what mode of glorifying God, or being serviceable tomankind in his day and generation—may that be? Why, thedegenerate fellow might as well have been a fiddler!” Suchare the compliments bandied between my great-grandsires andmyself, across the gulf of time! And yet, let them scorn meas they will, strong traits of their nature have intertwined themselveswith mine.</p><p>Planted deep, in the town's earliest infancy and childhood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>by these two earnest and energetic men, the race has ever sincesubsisted here; always, too, in respectability; never, so far asI have known, disgraced by a single unworthy member; butseldom or never, on the other hand, after the first two generations,performing any memorable deed, or so much as puttingforward a claim to public notice. Gradually, they have sunkalmost out of sight; as old houses, here and there about thestreets, get covered half-way to the eaves by the accumulationof new soil. From father to son, for above a hundred years,they followed the sea; a gray-headed shipmaster, in each generation,retiring from the quarter-deck to the homestead, whilea boy of fourteen took the hereditary place before the mast,confronting the salt spray and the gale, which had blusteredagainst his sire and grandsire. The boy, also, in due time,passed from the forecastle to the cabin, spent a tempestuousmanhood, and returned from his world-wanderings, to grow old,and die, and mingle his dust with the natal earth. This longconnection of a family with one spot, as its place of birth andburial, creates a kindred between the human being and thelocality, quite independent of any charm in the scenery or moralcircumstances that surround him. It is not love, but instinct.The new inhabitant—who came himself from a foreign land,or whose father or grandfather came—has little claim to becalled a Salemite; he has no conception of the oyster-like tenacitywith which an old settler, over whom his third century iscreeping, clings to the spot where his successive generations havebeen imbedded. It is no matter that the place is joyless forhim; that he is weary of the old wooden houses, the mud anddust, the dead level of site and sentiment, the chill east wind,and the chillest of social atmospheres;—all these, and whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>faults besides he may see or imagine, are nothing to thepurpose. The spell survives, and just as powerfully as if thenatal spot were an earthly paradise. So has it been in my case.I felt it almost as a destiny to make Salem my home; so thatthe mould of features and cast of character which had all alongbeen familiar here,—ever, as one representative of the race laydown in his grave, another assuming, as it were, his sentry-marchalong the main street,—might still in my little day beseen and recognized in the old town. Nevertheless, this verysentiment is an evidence that the connection, which has becomean unhealthy one, should at last be severed. Human naturewill not flourish, any more than a potato, if it be planted andreplanted, for too long a series of generations, in the same worn-outsoil. My children have had other birthplaces, and, so faras their fortunes may be within my control, shall strike theirroots into unaccustomed earth.</p><p>On emerging from the Old Manse, it was chiefly this strange,indolent, unjoyous attachment for my native town, that broughtme to fill a place in Uncle Sam's brick edifice, when I mightas well, or better, have gone somewhere else. My doom wason me. It was not the first time, nor the second, that I hadgone away,—as it seemed, permanently,—but yet returned,like the bad half-penny; or as if Salem were for me the inevitablecentre of the universe. So, one fine morning, I ascendedthe flight of granite steps, with the President's commission inmy pocket, and was introduced to the corps of gentlemen whowere to aid me in my weighty responsibility, as chief executiveofficer of the Custom-House.</p><p>I doubt greatly—or, rather, I do not doubt at all—whetherany public functionary of the United States, either in the civil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>or military line, has ever had such a patriarchal body of veteransunder his orders as myself. The whereabouts of theOldest Inhabitant was at once settled, when I looked at them.For upwards of twenty years before this epoch, the independentposition of the Collector had kept the Salem Custom-Houseout of the whirlpool of political vicissitude, which makes thetenure of office generally so fragile. A soldier,—New England'smost distinguished soldier,—he stood firmly on the pedestal ofhis gallant services; and, himself secure in the wise liberalityof the successive administrations through which he had heldoffice, he had been the safety of his subordinates in many anhour of danger and heart-quake. General Miller was radicallyconservative; a man over whose kindly nature habit had noslight influence; attaching himself strongly to familiar faces, andwith difficulty moved to change, even when change might havebrought unquestionable improvement. Thus, on taking chargeof my department, I found few but aged men. They were ancientsea-captains, for the most part, who, after being tost onevery sea, and standing up sturdily against life's tempestuousblasts, had finally drifted into this quiet nook; where, withlittle to disturb them, except the periodical terrors of a Presidentialelection, they one and all acquired a new lease of existence.Though by no means less liable than their fellow-mento age and infirmity, they had evidently some talisman or otherthat kept death at bay. Two or three of their number, as Iwas assured, being gouty and rheumatic, or perhaps bedridden,never dreamed of making their appearance at the Custom-House,during a large part of the year; but, after a torpid winter,would creep out into the warm sunshine of May or June, golazily about what they termed duty, and, at their own leisure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>and convenience, betake themselves to bed again. I must pleadguilty to the charge of abbreviating the official breath of morethan one of these venerable servants of the republic. They wereallowed, on my representation, to rest from their arduous labors,and soon afterwards—as if their sole principle of life had beenzeal for their country's service, as I verily believe it was—withdrewto a better world. It is a pious consolation to me,that, through my interference, a sufficient space was allowedthem for repentance of the evil and corrupt practices into which,as a matter of course, every Custom-House officer must be supposedto fall. Neither the front nor the back entrance of theCustom-House opens on the road to Paradise.</p><p>The greater part of my officers were Whigs. It was well fortheir venerable brotherhood that the new Surveyor was not apolitician, and though a faithful Democrat in principle, neitherreceived nor held his office with any reference to political services.Had it been otherwise,—had an active politician been put intothis influential post, to assume the easy task of making headagainst a Whig Collector, whose infirmities withheld him fromthe personal administration of his office,—hardly a man of theold corps would have drawn the breath of official life, within amonth after the exterminating angel had come up the Custom-Housesteps. According to the received code in such matters,it would have been nothing short of duty, in a politician, tobring every one of those white heads under the axe of the guillotine.It was plain enough to discern, that the old fellowsdreaded some such discourtesy at my hands. It pained, and atthe same time amused me, to behold the terrors that attendedmy advent; to see a furrowed cheek, weather-beaten by half acentury of storm, turn ashy pale at the glance of so harmless an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>individual as myself; to detect, as one or another addressed me,the tremor of a voice, which, in long-past days, had been wontto bellow through a speaking-trumpet, hoarsely enough to frightenBoreas himself to silence. They knew, these excellent old persons,that, by all established rule,—and, as regarded some of them,weighed by their own lack of efficiency for business,—they oughtto have given place to younger men, more orthodox in politics,and altogether fitter than themselves to serve our common Uncle.I knew it too, but could never quite find in my heart to actupon the knowledge. Much and deservedly to my own discredit,therefore, and considerably to the detriment of my official conscience,they continued, during my incumbency, to creep aboutthe wharves, and loiter up and down the Custom-House steps.They spent a good deal of time, also, asleep in their accustomedcorners, with their chairs tilted back against the wall; awaking,however, once or twice in a forenoon, to bore one another withthe several thousandth repetition of old sea-stories, and mouldyjokes, that had grown to be passwords and countersigns amongthem.</p><p>The discovery was soon made, I imagine, that the new Surveyorhad no great harm in him. So, with lightsome hearts,and the happy consciousness of being usefully employed,—intheir own behalf, at least, if not for our beloved country,—thesegood old gentlemen went through the various formalities ofoffice. Sagaciously, under their spectacles, did they peep intothe holds of vessels! Mighty was their fuss about little matters,and marvellous, sometimes, the obtuseness that allowed greaterones to slip between their fingers! Whenever such a mischanceoccurred,—when a wagon-load of valuable merchandise hadbeen smuggled ashore, at noonday, perhaps, and directly beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>their unsuspicious noses,—nothing could exceed the vigilanceand alacrity with which they proceeded to lock, and double-lock,and secure with tape and sealing-wax, all the avenues of thedelinquent vessel. Instead of a reprimand for their previousnegligence, the case seemed rather to require an eulogium ontheir praiseworthy caution, after the mischief had happened; agrateful recognition of the promptitude of their zeal, the momentthat there was no longer any remedy.</p><p>Unless people are more than commonly disagreeable, it is myfoolish habit to contract a kindness for them. The better partof my companion's character, if it have a better part, is thatwhich usually comes uppermost in my regard, and forms thetype whereby I recognize the man. As most of these old Custom-Houseofficers had good traits, and as my position in referenceto them, being paternal and protective, was favorable tothe growth of friendly sentiments, I soon grew to like themall. It was pleasant, in the summer forenoons,—when the ferventheat, that almost liquefied the rest of the human family,merely communicated a genial warmth to their half-torpid systems,—itwas pleasant to hear them chatting in the back entry,a row of them all tipped against the wall, as usual; while thefrozen witticisms of past generations were thawed out, and camebubbling with laughter from their lips. Externally, the jollityof aged men has much in common with the mirth of children;the intellect, any more than a deep sense of humor, has littleto do with the matter; it is, with both, a gleam that plays uponthe surface, and imparts a sunny and cheery aspect alike to thegreen branch, and gray, mouldering trunk. In one case, however,it is real sunshine; in the other, it more resembles thephosphorescent glow of decaying wood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p><p>It would be sad injustice, the reader must understand, to representall my excellent old friends as in their dotage. In thefirst place, my coadjutors were not invariably old; there weremen among them in their strength and prime, of marked abilityand energy, and altogether superior to the sluggish and dependentmode of life on which their evil stars had cast them. Then,moreover, the white locks of age were sometimes found to bethe thatch of an intellectual tenement in good repair. But, asrespects the majority of my corps of veterans, there will be nowrong done, if I characterize them generally as a set of wearisomeold souls, who had gathered nothing worth preservationfrom their varied experience of life. They seemed to have flungaway all the golden grain of practical wisdom, which they hadenjoyed so many opportunities of harvesting, and most carefullyto have stored their memories with the husks. They spoke withfar more interest and unction of their morning's breakfast, oryesterday's, to-day's, or to-morrow's dinner, than of the shipwreckof forty or fifty years ago, and all the world's wonderswhich they had witnessed with their youthful eyes.</p><p>The father of the Custom-House—the patriarch, not only ofthis little squad of officials, but, I am bold to say, of the respectablebody of tide-waiters all over the United States—was acertain permanent Inspector. He might truly be termed a legitimateson of the revenue system, dyed in the wool, or, rather,born in the purple; since his sire, a Revolutionary colonel, andformerly collector of the port, had created an office for him, andappointed him to fill it, at a period of the early ages which fewliving men can now remember. This Inspector, when I firstknew him, was a man of fourscore years, or thereabouts, andcertainly one of the most wonderful specimens of winter-green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>that you would be likely to discover in a lifetime's search. Withhis florid cheek, his compact figure, smartly arrayed in a bright-buttonedblue coat, his brisk and vigorous step, and his haleand hearty aspect, altogether he seemed—not young, indeed—buta kind of new contrivance of Mother Nature in the shapeof man, whom age and infirmity had no business to touch. Hisvoice and laugh, which perpetually re-echoed through the Custom-House,had nothing of the tremulous quaver and cackle ofan old man's utterance; they came strutting out of his lungs,like the crow of a cock, or the blast of a clarion. Looking athim merely as an animal,—and there was very little else tolook at,—he was a most satisfactory object, from the thoroughhealthfulness and wholesomeness of his system, and his capacity,at that extreme age, to enjoy all, or nearly all, the delights whichhe had ever aimed at, or conceived of. The careless security ofhis life in the Custom-House, on a regular income, and with butslight and infrequent apprehensions of removal, had no doubtcontributed to make time pass lightly over him. The originaland more potent causes, however, lay in the rare perfection ofhis animal nature, the moderate proportion of intellect, and thevery trifling admixture of moral and spiritual ingredients; theselatter qualities, indeed, being in barely enough measure to keepthe old gentleman from walking on all-fours. He possessed nopower of thought, no depth of feeling, no troublesome sensibilities;nothing, in short, but a few commonplace instincts, which,aided by the cheerful temper that grew inevitably out of hisphysical well-being, did duty very respectably, and to generalacceptance, in lieu of a heart. He had been the husband ofthree wives, all long since dead; the father of twenty children,most of whom, at every age of childhood or maturity, had likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>returned to dust. Here, one would suppose, might havebeen sorrow enough to imbue the sunniest disposition, throughand through, with a sable tinge. Not so with our old Inspector!One brief sigh sufficed to carry off the entire burden of thesedismal reminiscences. The next moment, he was as ready forsport as any unbreeched infant; far readier than the Collector'sjunior clerk, who, at nineteen years, was much the elder andgraver man of the two.</p><p>I used to watch and study this patriarchal personage with, Ithink, livelier curiosity, than any other form of humanity therepresented to my notice. He was, in truth, a rare phenomenon;so perfect, in one point of view; so shallow, so delusive, so impalpable,such an absolute nonentity, in every other. My conclusionwas that he had no soul, no heart, no mind; nothing, as Ihave already said, but instincts: and yet, withal, so cunninglyhad the few materials of his character been put together, thatthere was no painful perception of deficiency, but, on my part,an entire contentment with what I found in him. It mightbe difficult—and it was so—to conceive how he should existhereafter, so earthly and sensuous did he seem; but surely hisexistence here, admitting that it was to terminate with his lastbreath, had been not unkindly given; with no higher moralresponsibilities than the beasts of the field, but with a largerscope of enjoyment than theirs, and with all their blessed immunityfrom the dreariness and duskiness of age.</p><p>One point, in which he had vastly the advantage over hisfour-footed brethren, was his ability to recollect the good dinnerswhich it had made no small portion of the happiness of hislife to eat. His gourmandism was a highly agreeable trait; andto hear him talk of roast-meat was as appetizing as a pickle or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>an oyster. As he possessed no higher attribute, and neithersacrificed nor vitiated any spiritual endowment by devoting allhis energies and ingenuities to subserve the delight and profitof his maw, it always pleased and satisfied me to hear himexpatiate on fish, poultry, and butcher's meat, and the mosteligible methods of preparing them for the table. His reminiscencesof good cheer, however ancient the date of the actual banquet,seemed to bring the savor of pig or turkey under one'svery nostrils. There were flavors on his palate that had lingeredthere not less than sixty or seventy years, and were still apparentlyas fresh as that of the mutton-chop which he had justdevoured for his breakfast. I have heard him smack his lipsover dinners, every guest at which, except himself, had long beenfood for worms. It was marvellous to observe how the ghostsof bygone meals were continually rising up before him; not inanger or retribution, but as if grateful for his former appreciationand seeking to resuscitate an endless series of enjoyment, atonce shadowy and sensual. A tender-loin of beef, a hind-quarterof veal, a spare-rib of pork, a particular chicken, or a remarkablypraiseworthy turkey, which had perhaps adorned his boardin the days of the elder Adams, would be remembered; whileall the subsequent experience of our race, and all the events thatbrightened or darkened his individual career, had gone over himwith as little permanent effect as the passing breeze. The chieftragic event of the old man's life, so far as I could judge, washis mishap with a certain goose which lived and died sometwenty or forty years ago; a goose of most promising figure,but which, at table, proved so inveterately tough that the carving-knifewould make no impression on its carcass, and it couldonly be divided with an axe and handsaw.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p><p>But it is time to quit this sketch; on which, however, Ishould be glad to dwell at considerably more length because, ofall men whom I have ever known, this individual was fittest tobe a Custom-House officer. Most persons, owing to causes whichI may not have space to hint at, suffer moral detriment fromthis peculiar mode of life. The old Inspector was incapable ofit, and, were he to continue in office to the end of time, wouldbe just as good as he was then, and sit down to dinner with justas good an appetite.</p><p>There is one likeness, without which my gallery of Custom-Houseportraits would be strangely incomplete; but which mycomparatively few opportunities for observation enable me tosketch only in the merest outline. It is that of the Collector,our gallant old General, who, after his brilliant military service,subsequently to which he had ruled over a wild Western territory,had come hither, twenty years before, to spend the declineof his varied and honorable life. The brave soldier had alreadynumbered, nearly or quite, his threescore years and ten, and waspursuing the remainder of his earthly march, burdened with infirmitieswhich even the martial music of his own spirit-stirringrecollections could do little towards lightening. The step waspalsied now that had been foremost in the charge. It was onlywith the assistance of a servant, and by leaning his hand heavilyon the iron balustrade, that he could slowly and painfully ascendthe Custom-House steps, and, with a toilsome progress acrossthe floor, attain his customary chair beside the fireplace. Therehe used to sit, gazing with a somewhat dim serenity of aspectat the figures that came and went; amid the rustle of papers,the administering of oaths, the discussion of business, and thecasual talk of the office; all which sounds and circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>seemed but indistinctly to impress his senses, and hardly to maketheir way into his inner sphere of contemplation. His countenance,in this repose, was mild and kindly. If his notice wassought, an expression of courtesy and interest gleamed out uponhis features; proving that there was light within him, and thatit was only the outward medium of the intellectual lamp thatobstructed the rays in their passage. The closer you penetratedto the substance of his mind, the sounder it appeared. Whenno longer called upon to speak, or listen, either of which operationscost him an evident effort, his face would briefly subsideinto its former not uncheerful quietude. It was not painful tobehold this look; for, though dim, it had not the imbecility ofdecaying age. The framework of his nature, originally strongand massive, was not yet crumbled into ruin.</p><p>To observe and define his character, however, under such disadvantages,was as difficult a task as to trace out and build upanew, in imagination, an old fortress, like Ticonderoga, froma view of its gray and broken ruins. Here and there, perchance,the walls may remain almost complete, but elsewheremay be only a shapeless mound, cumbrous with its very strength,and overgrown, through long years of peace and neglect, withgrass and alien weeds.</p><p>Nevertheless, looking at the old warrior with affection,—for,slight as was the communication between us, my feeling towardshim, like that of all bipeds and quadrupeds who knew him,might not improperly be termed so,—I could discern the mainpoints of his portrait. It was marked with the noble and heroicqualities which showed it to be not by a mere accident,but of good right, that he had won a distinguished name. Hisspirit could never, I conceive, have been characterized by an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>uneasy activity; it must, at any period of his life, have requiredan impulse to set him in motion; but, once stirred up, withobstacles to overcome, and an adequate object to be attained,it was not in the man to give out or fail. The heat that hadformerly pervaded his nature, and which was not yet extinct,was never of the kind that flashes and flickers in a blaze; but,rather, a deep, red glow, as of iron in a furnace. Weight,solidity, firmness; this was the expression of his repose, evenin such decay as had crept untimely over him, at the periodof which I speak. But I could imagine, even then, that, undersome excitement which should go deeply into his consciousness,—rousedby a trumpet-peal, loud enough to awaken all hisenergies that were not dead, but only slumbering,—he wasyet capable of flinging off his infirmities like a sick man's gown,dropping the staff of age to seize a battle-sword, and startingup once more a warrior. And, in so intense a moment, hisdemeanor would have still been calm. Such an exhibition, however,was but to be pictured in fancy; not to be anticipated,nor desired. What I saw in him—as evidently as the indestructibleramparts of Old Ticonderoga already cited as the mostappropriate simile—were the features of stubborn and ponderousendurance, which might well have amounted to obstinacyin his earlier days; of integrity, that, like most of his otherendowments, lay in a somewhat heavy mass, and was just asunmalleable and unmanageable as a ton of iron ore; and ofbenevolence, which, fiercely as he led the bayonets on at Chippewaor Fort Erie, I take to be of quite as genuine a stampas what actuates any or all the polemical philanthropists of theage. He had slain men with his own hand, for aught I know,—certainly,they had fallen, like blades of grass at the sweep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>of the scythe, before the charge to which his spirit imparted itstriumphant energy;—but, be that as it might, there was neverin his heart so much cruelty as would have brushed the downoff a butterfly's wing. I have not known the man to whoseinnate kindliness I would more confidently make an appeal.</p><p>Many characteristics—and those, too, which contribute notthe least forcibly to impart resemblance in a sketch—must havevanished, or been obscured, before I met the General. Allmerely graceful attributes are usually the most evanescent; nordoes Nature adorn the human ruin with blossoms of new beauty,that have their roots and proper nutriment only in the chinksand crevices of decay, as she sows wall-flowers over the ruinedfortress of Ticonderoga. Still, even in respect of grace andbeauty, there were points well worth noting. A ray of humor,now and then, would make its way through the veil of dimobstruction, and glimmer pleasantly upon our faces. A trait ofnative elegance, seldom seen in the masculine character afterchildhood or early youth, was shown in the General's fondnessfor the sight and fragrance of flowers. An old soldier mightbe supposed to prize only the bloody laurel on his brow; buthere was one who seemed to have a young girl's appreciationof the floral tribe.</p><p>There, beside the fireplace, the brave old General used to sit;while the Surveyor—though seldom, when it could be avoided,taking upon himself the difficult task of engaging him in conversation—wasfond of standing at a distance, and watchinghis quiet and almost slumberous countenance. He seemed awayfrom us, although we saw him but a few yards off; remote,though we passed close beside his chair; unattainable, thoughwe might have stretched forth our hands and touched his own.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>It might be that he lived a more real life within his thoughts,than amid the unappropriate environment of the Collector's office.The evolutions of the parade; the tumult of the battle; the flourishof old, heroic music, heard thirty years before;—such scenesand sounds, perhaps, were all alive before his intellectual sense.Meanwhile, the merchants and shipmasters, the spruce clerksand uncouth sailors, entered and departed; the bustle of thiscommercial and custom-house life kept up its little murmurround about him; and neither with the men nor their affairsdid the General appear to sustain the most distant relation. Hewas as much out of place as an old sword—now rusty, butwhich had flashed once in the battle's front, and showed stilla bright gleam along its blade—would have been, among theinkstands, paper-folders, and mahogany rulers, on the DeputyCollector's desk.</p><p>There was one thing that much aided me in renewing andre-creating the stalwart soldier of the Niagara frontier,—theman of true and simple energy. It was the recollection of thosememorable words of his,—“I'll try, Sir!”—spoken on thevery verge of a desperate and heroic enterprise, and breathingthe soul and spirit of New England hardihood, comprehendingall perils, and encountering all. If, in our country, valor wererewarded by heraldic honor, this phrase—which it seems soeasy to speak, but which only he, with such a task of dangerand glory before him, has ever spoken—would be the best andfittest of all mottoes for the General's shield of arms.</p><p>It contributes greatly towards a man's moral and intellectualhealth, to be brought into habits of companionship with individualsunlike himself, who care little for his pursuits, and whosesphere and abilities he must go out of himself to appreciate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>The accidents of my life have often afforded me this advantage,but never with more fulness and variety than during my continuancein office. There was one man, especially, the observationof whose character gave me a new idea of talent. Hisgifts were emphatically those of a man of business; prompt,acute, clear-minded; with an eye that saw through all perplexities,and a faculty of arrangement that made them vanish, asby the waving of an enchanter's wand. Bred up from boyhoodin the Custom-House, it was his proper field of activity; andthe many intricacies of business, so harassing to the interloper,presented themselves before him with the regularity of a perfectlycomprehended system. In my contemplation, he stoodas the ideal of his class. He was, indeed, the Custom-Housein himself; or, at all events, the main-spring that kept its variouslyrevolving wheels in motion; for, in an institution likethis, where its officers are appointed to subserve their own profitand convenience, and seldom with a leading reference to theirfitness for the duty to be performed, they must perforce seekelsewhere the dexterity which is not in them. Thus, by aninevitable necessity, as a magnet attracts steel-filings, so did ourman of business draw to himself the difficulties which everybodymet with. With an easy condescension, and kind forbearancetowards our stupidity,—which, to his order of mind, must haveseemed little short of crime,—would he forthwith, by the meresttouch of his finger, make the incomprehensible as clear as daylight.The merchants valued him not less than we, his esotericfriends. His integrity was perfect: it was a law of nature withhim, rather than a choice or a principle; nor can it be otherwisethan the main condition of an intellect so remarkablyclear and accurate as his, to be honest and regular in the administration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>of affairs. A stain on his conscience, as to anythingthat came within the range of his vocation, would troublesuch a man very much in the same way, though to a fargreater degree, that an error in the balance of an account oran ink-blot on the fair page of a book of record. Here, in aword,—and it is a rare instance in my life,—I had met witha person thoroughly adapted to the situation which he held.</p><p>Such were some of the people with whom I now found myselfconnected. I took it in good part, at the hands of Providence,that I was thrown into a position so little akin to my pasthabits, and set myself seriously to gather from it whatever profitwas to be had. After my fellowship of toil and impracticableschemes with the dreamy brethren of Brook Farm; after livingfor three years within the subtile influence of an intellect likeEmerson's; after those wild, free days on the Assabeth, indulgingfantastic speculations, beside our fire of fallen boughs, withEllery Channing; after talking with Thoreau about pine-treesand Indian relics, in his hermitage at Walden; after growingfastidious by sympathy with the classic refinement of Hillard'sculture; after becoming imbued with poetic sentiment at Longfellow'shearthstone;—it was time, at length, that I shouldexercise other faculties of my nature, and nourish myself withfood for which I had hitherto had little appetite. Even the oldInspector was desirable, as a change of diet, to a man who hadknown Alcott. I look upon it as an evidence, in some measure,of a system naturally well balanced, and lacking no essential part ofa thorough organization, that, with such associates to remember,I could mingle at once with men of altogether different qualities,and never murmur at the change.</p><p>Literature, its exertions and objects, were now of little moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>in my regard. I cared not, at this period, for books;they were apart from me. Nature,—except it were humannature,—the nature that is developed in earth and sky, was, inone sense, hidden from me; and all the imaginative delight,wherewith it had been spiritualized, passed away out of mymind. A gift, a faculty if it had not departed, was suspendedand inanimate within me. There would have been somethingsad, unutterably dreary, in all this, had I not been consciousthat it lay at my own option to recall whatever was valuable inthe past. It might be true, indeed, that this was a life whichcould not with impunity be lived too long; else, it might havemade me permanently other than I had been without transformingme into any shape which it would be worth my while totake. But I never considered it as other than a transitory life.There was always a prophetic instinct, a low whisper in my ear,that, within no long period, and whenever a new change of customshould be essential to my good, a change would come.</p><p>Meanwhile, there I was, a Surveyor of the Revenue, and, sofar as I have been able to understand, as good a Surveyor asneed be. A man of thought, fancy, and sensibility (had he tentimes the Surveyor's proportion of those qualities) may, at anytime, be a man of affairs, if he will only choose to give himselfthe trouble. My fellow-officers, and the merchants and sea-captainswith whom my official duties brought me into any mannerof connection, viewed me in no other light, and probably knewme in no other character. None of them, I presume, had everread a page of my inditing, or would have cared a fig the morefor me, if they had read them all; nor would it have mendedthe matter, in the least, had those same unprofitable pages beenwritten with a pen like that of Burns or of Chaucer, each of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>whom was a custom-house officer in his day, as well as I. Itis a good lesson—though it may often be a hard one—for aman who has dreamed of literary fame, and of making for himselfa rank among the world's dignitaries by such means, tostep aside out of the narrow circle in which his claims are recognized,and to find how utterly devoid of significance, beyondthat circle, is all that he achieves, and all he aims at. I knownot that I especially needed the lesson, either in the way ofwarning or rebuke; but, at any rate, I learned it thoroughly:nor, it gives me pleasure to reflect, did the truth, as it camehome to my perception, ever cost me a pang, or require to bethrown off in a sigh. In the way of literary talk, it is true,the Naval Officer—an excellent fellow, who came into officewith me and went out only a little later—would often engageme in a discussion about one or the other of his favorite topics,Napoleon or Shakespeare. The Collector's junior clerk, too—ayoung gentleman who, it was whispered, occasionally covereda sheet of Uncle Sam's letter-paper with what (at the distanceof a few yards) looked very much like poetry—used now andthen to speak to me of books, as matters with which I mightpossibly be conversant. This was my all of lettered intercourse;and it was quite sufficient for my necessities.</p><p>No longer seeking nor caring that my name should be blazonedabroad on title-pages, I smiled to think that it had nowanother kind of vogue. The Custom-House marker imprinted it,with a stencil and black paint, on pepper-bags, and baskets ofanatto, and cigar-boxes, and bales of all kinds of dutiable merchandise,in testimony that these commodities had paid the impost,and gone regularly through the office. Borne on suchqueer vehicle of fame, a knowledge of my existence, so far as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>name conveys it, was carried where it had never been before,and, I hope, will never go again.</p><p>But the past was not dead. Once in a great while thethoughts that had seemed so vital and so active, yet had beenput to rest so quietly, revived again. One of the most remarkableoccasions, when the habit of bygone days awoke in me,was that which brings it within the law of literary propriety tooffer the public the sketch which I am now writing.</p><p>In the second story of the Custom-House there is a largeroom, in which the brick-work and naked rafters have neverbeen covered with panelling and plaster. The edifice—originallyprojected on a scale adapted to the old commercial enterpriseof the port, and with an idea of subsequent prosperity destinednever to be realized—contains far more space than itsoccupants know what to do with. This airy hall, therefore, overthe Collector's apartments, remains unfinished to this day, and,in spite of the aged cobwebs that festoon its dusky beams, appearsstill to await the labor of the carpenter and mason. Atone end of the room, in a recess, were a number of barrels, piledone upon another, containing bundles of official documents. Largequantities of similar rubbish lay lumbering the floor. It wassorrowful to think how many days and weeks and months andyears of toil had been wasted on these musty papers, which werenow only an encumbrance on earth, and were hidden away inthis forgotten corner, never more to be glanced at by human eyes.But, then, what reams of other manuscripts—filled not with thedulness of official formalities, but with the thought of inventivebrains and the rich effusion of deep hearts—had gone equally tooblivion; and that, moreover, without serving a purpose in theirday, as these heaped-up papers had, and—saddest of all—without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>purchasing for their writers the comfortable livelihood whichthe clerks of the Custom-House had gained by these worthlessscratchings of the pen! Yet not altogether worthless, perhaps,as materials of local history. Here, no doubt, statistics of theformer commerce of Salem might be discovered, and memorialsof her princely merchants,—old King Derby, old Billy Gray,old Simon Forrester, and many another magnate in his day;whose powdered head, however, was scarcely in the tomb, beforehis mountain pile of wealth began to dwindle. The founders ofthe greater part of the families which now compose the aristocracyof Salem might here be traced, from the petty and obscurebeginnings of their traffic, at periods generally much posterior tothe Revolution, upward to what their children look upon aslong-established rank.</p><p>Prior to the Revolution there is a dearth of records; theearlier documents and archives of the Custom-House having,probably, been carried off to Halifax, when all the King's officialsaccompanied the British army in its flight from Boston. It hasoften been a matter of regret with me; for, going back, perhaps,to the days of the Protectorate, those papers must have containedmany references to forgotten or remembered men, and toantique customs, which would have affected me with the samepleasure as when I used to pick up Indian arrow-heads in thefield near the Old Manse.</p><p>But, one idle and rainy day, it was my fortune to make a discoveryof some little interest. Poking and burrowing into theheaped-up rubbish in the corner; unfolding one and anotherdocument, and reading the names of vessels that had long agofoundered at sea or rotted at the wharves, and those of merchants,never heard of now on 'Change, nor very readily decipherable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>on their mossy tombstones; glancing at such matters withthe saddened, weary, half-reluctant interest which we bestow onthe corpse of dead activity,—and exerting my fancy, sluggishwith little use, to raise up from these dry bones an image ofthe old town's brighter aspect, when India was a new region,and only Salem knew the way thither,—I chanced to lay myhand on a small package, carefully done up in a piece of ancientyellow parchment. This envelope had the air of an officialrecord of some period long past, when clerks engrossed theirstiff and formal chirography on more substantial materials thanat present. There was something about it that quickened aninstinctive curiosity, and made me undo the faded red tape, thattied up the package, with the sense that a treasure would herebe brought to light. Unbending the rigid folds of the parchmentcover, I found it to be a commission, under the hand and sealof Governor Shirley, in favor of one Jonathan Pue, as Surveyorof his Majesty's Customs for the port of Salem, in the Provinceof Massachusetts Bay. I remember to have read (probably inFelt's Annals) a notice of the decease of Mr. Surveyor Pue,about fourscore years ago; and likewise, in a newspaper of recenttimes, an account of the digging up of his remains in the littlegraveyard of St. Peter's Church, during the renewal of thatedifice. Nothing, if I rightly call to mind, was left of myrespected predecessor, save an imperfect skeleton, and some fragmentsof apparel, and a wig of majestic frizzle; which, unlikethe head that it once adorned, was in very satisfactory preservation.But, on examining the papers which the parchment commissionserved to envelop, I found more traces of Mr. Pue'smental part, and the internal operations of his head, than thefrizzled wig had contained of the venerable skull itself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p><p>They were documents, in short, not official, but of a privatenature, or at least written in his private capacity, and apparentlywith his own hand. I could account for their being includedin the heap of Custom-House lumber only by the factthat Mr. Pue's death had happened suddenly; and that thesepapers, which he probably kept in his official desk, had nevercome to the knowledge of his heirs, or were supposed to relateto the business of the revenue. On the transfer of the archivesto Halifax, this package, proving to be of no public concern,was left behind, and had remained ever since unopened.</p><p>The ancient Surveyor—being little molested, I suppose, atthat early day, with business pertaining to his office—seemsto have devoted some of his many leisure hours to researchesas a local antiquarian, and other inquisitions of a similar nature.These supplied material for petty activity to a mind that wouldotherwise have been eaten up with rust. A portion of his facts,by the by, did me good service in the preparation of the articleentitled “<span class="smcap">Main Street</span>,” included in the present volume. Theremainder may perhaps be applied to purposes equally valuable,hereafter; or not impossibly may be worked up, so far asthey go, into a regular history of Salem, should my venerationfor the natal soil ever impel me to so pious a task. Meanwhile,they shall be at the command of any gentleman, inclined, andcompetent, to take the unprofitable labor off my hands. As afinal disposition, I contemplate depositing them with the EssexHistorical Society.</p><p>But the object that most drew my attention, in the mysteriouspackage, was a certain affair of fine red cloth, much worn andfaded. There were traces about it of gold embroidery, which,however, was greatly frayed and defaced; so that none, or very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>little, of the glitter was left. It had been wrought, as was easyto perceive, with wonderful skill of needlework; and the stitch(as I am assured by ladies conversant with such mysteries) givesevidence of a now forgotten art, not to be recovered even bythe process of picking out the threads. This rag of scarletcloth,—for time and wear and a sacrilegious moth had reducedit to little other than a rag,—on careful examination, assumedthe shape of a letter. It was the capital letter A. By an accuratemeasurement, each limb proved to be precisely three inchesand a quarter in length. It had been intended, there could beno doubt, as an ornamental article of dress; but how it was tobe worn, or what rank, honor, and dignity, in by-past times,were signified by it, was a riddle which (so evanescent are thefashions of the world in these particulars) I saw little hope ofsolving. And yet it strangely interested me. My eyes fastenedthemselves upon the old scarlet letter, and would not be turnedaside. Certainly, there was some deep meaning in it, most worthyof interpretation, and which, as it were, streamed forth fromthe mystic symbol, subtly communicating itself to my sensibilities,but evading the analysis of my mind.</p><p>While thus perplexed,—and cogitating, among other hypotheses,whether the letter might not have been one of those decorationswhich the white men used to contrive, in order to takethe eyes of Indians,—I happened to place it on my breast.It seemed to me,—the reader may smile, but must not doubtmy word,—it seemed to me, then, that I experienced a sensationnot altogether physical, yet almost so, of burning heat;and as if the letter were not of red cloth, but red-hot iron. Ishuddered, and involuntarily let it fall upon the floor.</p><p>In the absorbing contemplation of the scarlet letter, I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>hitherto neglected to examine a small roll of dingy paper, aroundwhich it had been twisted. This I now opened, and had thesatisfaction to find, recorded by the old Surveyor's pen, a reasonablycomplete explanation of the whole affair. There wereseveral foolscap sheets containing many particulars respecting thelife and conversation of one Hester Prynne, who appeared to havebeen rather a noteworthy personage in the view of our ancestors.She had flourished during the period between the earlydays of Massachusetts and the close of the seventeenth century.Aged persons, alive in the time of Mr. Surveyor Pue, and fromwhose oral testimony he had made up his narrative, rememberedher, in their youth, as a very old, but not decrepit woman, ofa stately and solemn aspect. It had been her habit, from analmost immemorial date, to go about the country as a kind ofvoluntary nurse, and doing whatever miscellaneous good shemight; taking upon herself, likewise, to give advice in all matters,especially those of the heart; by which means, as a personof such propensities inevitably must, she gained from many peoplethe reverence due to an angel, but, I should imagine, waslooked upon by others as an intruder and a nuisance. Pryingfurther into the manuscript, I found the record of other doingsand sufferings of this singular woman, for most of which thereader is referred to the story entitled “<span class="smcap">The Scarlet Letter</span>”;and it should be borne carefully in mind, that the main factsof that story are authorized and authenticated by the documentof Mr. Surveyor Pue. The original papers, together with thescarlet letter itself,—a most curious relic,—are still in my possession,and shall be freely exhibited to whomsoever, inducedby the great interest of the narrative, may desire a sight ofthem. I must not be understood as affirming, that, in the dressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>up of the tale, and imagining the motives and modes ofpassion that influenced the characters who figure in it, I haveinvariably confined myself within the limits of the old Surveyor'shalf a dozen sheets of foolscap. On the contrary, I have allowedmyself, as to such points, nearly or altogether as much licenseas if the facts had been entirely of my own invention. WhatI contend for is the authenticity of the outline.</p><p>This incident recalled my mind, in some degree, to its oldtrack. There seemed to be here the groundwork of a tale. Itimpressed me as if the ancient Surveyor, in his garb of a hundredyears gone by, and wearing his immortal wig,—whichwas buried with him, but did not perish in the grave,—hadmet me in the deserted chamber of the Custom-House. In hisport was the dignity of one who had borne his Majesty's commission,and who was therefore illuminated by a ray of the splendorthat shone so dazzlingly about the throne. How unlike,alas! the hang-dog look of a republican official, who, as theservant of the people, feels himself less than the least, and belowthe lowest, of his masters. With his own ghostly hand, theobscurely seen but majestic figure had imparted to me the scarletsymbol, and the little roll of explanatory manuscript. Withhis own ghostly voice, he had exhorted me, on the sacred considerationof my filial duty and reverence towards him,—whomight reasonably regard himself as my official ancestor,—tobring his mouldy and moth-eaten lucubrations before the public.“Do this,” said the ghost of Mr. Surveyor Pue, emphaticallynodding the head that looked so imposing within its memorablewig,—“do this, and the profit shall be all your own!You will shortly need it; for it is not in your days as it wasin mine, when a man's office was a life-lease, and oftentimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>an heirloom. But, I charge you, in this matter of old MistressPrynne, give to your predecessor's memory the credit which willbe rightfully due!” And I said to the ghost of Mr. SurveyorPue, “I will!”</p><p>On Hester Prynne's story, therefore, I bestowed much thought.It was the subject of my meditations for many an hour, whilepacing to and fro across my room, or traversing, with a hundred-foldrepetition, the long extent from the front-door of theCustom-House to the side-entrance, and back again. Great werethe weariness and annoyance of the old Inspector and the Weighersand Gaugers, whose slumbers were disturbed by the unmercifullylengthened tramp of my passing and returning footsteps.Remembering their own former habits, they used to say thatthe Surveyor was walking the quarter-deck. They probablyfancied that my sole object—and, indeed, the sole object forwhich a sane man could ever put himself into voluntarymotion—was, to get an appetite for dinner. And to say thetruth, an appetite, sharpened by the east wind that generallyblew along the passage, was the only valuable result of so muchindefatigable exercise. So little adapted is the atmosphere ofa custom-house to the delicate harvest of fancy and sensibility,that, had I remained there through ten Presidencies yet tocome, I doubt whether the tale of “The Scarlet Letter” wouldever have been brought before the public eye. My imaginationwas a tarnished mirror. It would not reflect, or only with miserabledimness, the figures with which I did my best to peopleit. The characters of the narrative would not be warmed andrendered malleable by any heat that I could kindle at my intellectualforge. They would take neither the glow of passion northe tenderness of sentiment, but retained all the rigidity of dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>corpses, and stared me in the face with a fixed and ghastly grinof contemptuous defiance. “What have you to do with us?”that expression seemed to say. “The little power you mightonce have possessed over the tribe of unrealities is gone! Youhave bartered it for a pittance of the public gold. Go, then,and earn your wages!” In short, the almost torpid creaturesof my own fancy twitted me with imbecility, and not withoutfair occasion.</p><p>It was not merely during the three hours and a half whichUncle Sam claimed as his share of my daily life, that thiswretched numbness held possession of me. It went with meon my sea-shore walks, and rambles into the country, whenever—whichwas seldom and reluctantly—I bestirred myselfto seek that invigorating charm of Nature, which used to giveme such freshness and activity of thought the moment that Istepped across the threshold of the Old Manse. The same torpor,as regarded the capacity for intellectual effort, accompaniedme home, and weighed upon me in the chamber which I mostabsurdly termed my study. Nor did it quit me, when, lateat night, I sat in the deserted parlor, lighted only by theglimmering coal-fire and the moon, striving to picture forthimaginary scenes, which, the next day, might flow out on thebrightening page in many-hued description.</p><p>If the imaginative faculty refused to act at such an hour, itmight well be deemed a hopeless case. Moonlight, in a familiarroom, falling so white upon the carpet, and showing all its figuresso distinctly,—making every object so minutely visible, yet sounlike a morning or noontide visibility,—is a medium the mostsuitable for a romance-writer to get acquainted with his illusiveguests. There is the little domestic scenery of the well-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>apartment; the chairs, with each its separate individuality; thecentre-table, sustaining a work-basket, a volume or two, and anextinguished lamp; the sofa; the bookcase; the picture on thewall;—all these details, so completely seen, are so spiritualizedby the unusual light, that they seem to lose their actual substance,and become things of intellect. Nothing is too small ortoo trifling to undergo this change, and acquire dignity thereby.A child's shoe; the doll, seated in her little wicker carriage;the hobby-horse;—whatever, in a word, has been used or playedwith, during the day, is now invested with a quality of strangenessand remoteness, though still almost as vividly present asby daylight. Thus, therefore, the floor of our familiar room hasbecome a neutral territory, somewhere between the real worldand fairy-land, where the Actual and the Imaginary may meet,and each imbue itself with the nature of the other. Ghosts mightenter here, without affrighting us. It would be too much inkeeping with the scene to excite surprise, were we to look aboutus and discover a form beloved, but gone hence, now sittingquietly in a streak of this magic moonshine, with an aspect thatwould make us doubt whether it had returned from afar, or hadnever once stirred from our fireside.</p><p>The somewhat dim coal-fire has an essential influence in producingthe effect which I would describe. It throws its unobtrusivetinge throughout the room, with a faint ruddiness uponthe walls and ceiling, and a reflected gleam from the polish of thefurniture. This warmer light mingles itself with the cold spiritualityof the moonbeams, and communicates, as it were, a heartand sensibilities of human tenderness to the forms which fancysummons up. It converts them from snow-images into men andwomen. Glancing at the looking-glass, we behold—deep within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>its haunted verge—the smouldering glow of the half-extinguishedanthracite, the white moonbeams on the floor, and a repetitionof all the gleam and shadow of the picture, with one removefurther from the actual, and nearer to the imaginative. Then,at such an hour, and with this scene before him, if a man, sittingall alone, cannot dream strange things, and make them look liketruth, he need never try to write romances.</p><p>But, for myself, during the whole of my Custom-House experience,moonlight and sunshine, and the glow of firelight, werejust alike in my regard; and neither of them was of one whitmore avail than the twinkle of a tallow-candle. An entire classof susceptibilities, and a gift connected with them,—of no greatrichness or value, but the best I had,—was gone from me.</p><p>It is my belief, however, that, had I attempted a different orderof composition, my faculties would not have been found so pointlessand inefficacious. I might, for instance, have contented myselfwith writing out the narratives of a veteran shipmaster, oneof the Inspectors, whom I should be most ungrateful not to mention,since scarcely a day passed that he did not stir me to laughterand admiration by his marvellous gifts as a story-teller.Could I have preserved the picturesque force of his style, andthe humorous coloring which nature taught him how to throwover his descriptions, the result, I honestly believe, would havebeen something new in literature. Or I might readily have founda more serious task. It was a folly, with the materiality of thisdaily life pressing so intrusively upon me, to attempt to flingmyself back into another age; or to insist on creating the semblanceof a world out of airy matter, when, at every moment,the impalpable beauty of my soap-bubble was broken by therude contact of some actual circumstance. The wiser effort would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>have been, to diffuse thought and imagination through the opaquesubstance of to-day, and thus to make it a bright transparency;to spiritualize the burden that began to weigh so heavily; toseek, resolutely, the true and indestructible value that lay hiddenin the petty and wearisome incidents, and ordinary characters,with which I was now conversant. The fault was mine. Thepage of life that was spread out before me seemed dull and commonplace,only because I had not fathomed its deeper import.A better book than I shall ever write was there; leaf after leafpresenting itself to me, just as it was written out by the realityof the flitting hour, and vanishing as fast as written, only becausemy brain wanted the insight and my hand the cunning to transcribeit. At some future day, it may be, I shall remember afew scattered fragments and broken paragraphs, and write themdown, and find the letters turn to gold upon the page.</p><p>These perceptions have come too late. At the instant, I wasonly conscious that what would have been a pleasure once wasnow a hopeless toil. There was no occasion to make much moanabout this state of affairs. I had ceased to be a writer of tolerablypoor tales and essays, and had become a tolerably goodSurveyor of the Customs. That was all. But, nevertheless, itis anything but agreeable to be haunted by a suspicion thatone's intellect is dwindling away; or exhaling, without your consciousness,like ether out of a phial; so that, at every glance, youfind a smaller and less volatile residuum. Of the fact therecould be no doubt; and, examining myself and others, I wasled to conclusions, in reference to the effect of public office onthe character, not very favorable to the mode of life in question.In some other form, perhaps, I may hereafter develop theseeffects. Suffice it here to say, that a Custom-House officer, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>long continuance, can hardly be a very praiseworthy or respectablepersonage, for many reasons; one of them, the tenure bywhich he holds his situation, and another, the very nature of hisbusiness, which—though, I trust, an honest one—is of such asort that he does not share in the united effort of mankind.</p><p>An effect—which I believe to be observable, more or less, inevery individual who has occupied the position—is, that, whilehe leans on the mighty arm of the Republic, his own properstrength departs from him. He loses, in an extent proportionedto the weakness or force of his original nature, the capability ofself-support. If he possess an unusual share of native energy,or the enervating magic of place do not operate too long uponhim, his forfeited powers may be redeemable. The ejected officer—fortunatein the unkindly shove that sends him forth betimes,to struggle amid a struggling world—may return to himself,and become all that he has ever been. But this seldom happens.He usually keeps his ground just long enough for his own ruin,and is then thrust out, with sinews all unstrung, to totter alongthe difficult footpath of life as he best may. Conscious of hisown infirmity,—that his tempered steel and elasticity are lost,—heforever afterwards looks wistfully about him in quest of supportexternal to himself. His pervading and continual hope—ahallucination which, in the face of all discouragement, andmaking light of impossibilities, haunts him while he lives, and,I fancy, like the convulsive throes of the cholera, torments himfor a brief space after death—is, that finally, and in no longtime, by some happy coincidence of circumstances, he shall berestored to office. This faith, more than anything else, stealsthe pith and availability out of whatever enterprise he may dreamof undertaking. Why should he toil and moil, and be at so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>much trouble to pick himself up out of the mud, when, in alittle while hence, the strong arm of his Uncle will raise andsupport him? Why should he work for his living here, or goto dig gold in California, when he is so soon to be made happy,at monthly intervals, with a little pile of glittering coin out ofhis Uncle's pocket? It is sadly curious to observe how slighta taste of office suffices to infect a poor fellow with this singulardisease. Uncle Sam's gold—meaning no disrespect to the worthyold gentleman—has, in this respect, a quality of enchantmentlike that of the Devil's wages. Whoever touches it shouldlook well to himself, or he may find the bargain to go hardagainst him, involving, if not his soul, yet many of its betterattributes; its sturdy force, its courage and constancy, its truth,its self-reliance, and all that gives the emphasis to manly character.</p><p>Here was a fine prospect in the distance! Not that the Surveyorbrought the lesson home to himself, or admitted that hecould be so utterly undone, either by continuance in office, orejectment. Yet my reflections were not the most comfortable.I began to grow melancholy and restless; continually pryinginto my mind, to discover which of its poor properties weregone, and what degree of detriment had already accrued to theremainder. I endeavored to calculate how much longer I couldstay in the Custom-House, and yet go forth a man. To confessthe truth, it was my greatest apprehension,—as it would neverbe a measure of policy to turn out so quiet an individual asmyself, and it being hardly in the nature of a public officer toresign,—it was my chief trouble, therefore, that I was likelyto grow gray and decrepit in the Surveyorship, and becomemuch such another animal as the old Inspector. Might it not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>in the tedious lapse of official life that lay before me, finally bewith me as it was with this venerable friend,—to make thedinner-hour the nucleus of the day, and to spend the rest ofit, as an old dog spends it, asleep in the sunshine or in theshade? A dreary look-forward this, for a man who felt it tobe the best definition of happiness to live throughout the wholerange of his faculties and sensibilities! But, all this while, Iwas giving myself very unnecessary alarm. Providence hadmeditated better things for me than I could possibly imaginefor myself.</p><p>A remarkable event of the third year of my Surveyorship—toadopt the tone of “P.&nbsp;P.”—was the election of GeneralTaylor to the Presidency. It is essential, in order to form a completeestimate of the advantages of official life, to view the incumbentat the incoming of a hostile administration. His position is thenone of the most singularly irksome, and, in every contingency,disagreeable, that a wretched mortal can possibly occupy; withseldom an alternative of good, on either hand, although whatpresents itself to him as the worst event may very probably bethe best. But it is a strange experience, to a man of prideand sensibility, to know that his interests are within the controlof individuals who neither love nor understand him, and bywhom, since one or the other must needs happen, he wouldrather be injured than obliged. Strange, too, for one who haskept his calmness throughout the contest, to observe the blood-thirstinessthat is developed in the hour of triumph, and to beconscious that he is himself among its objects! There are fewuglier traits of human nature than this tendency—which I nowwitnessed in men no worse than their neighbors—to grow cruel,merely because they possessed the power of inflicting harm. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>the guillotine, as applied to office-holders, were a literal factinstead of one of the most apt of metaphors, it is my sincerebelief that the active members of the victorious party were sufficientlyexcited to have chopped off all our heads, and havethanked Heaven for the opportunity! It appears to me—whohave been a calm and curious observer, as well in victory asdefeat—that this fierce and bitter spirit of malice and revengehas never distinguished the many triumphs of my own party asit now did that of the Whigs. The Democrats take the offices,as a general rule, because they need them, and because the practiceof many years has made it the law of political warfare,which, unless a different system be proclaimed, it were weaknessand cowardice to murmur at. But the long habit of victoryhas made them generous. They know how to spare, when theysee occasion; and when they strike, the axe may be sharp, indeed,but its edge is seldom poisoned with ill-will; nor is it theircustom ignominiously to kick the head which they have juststruck off.</p><p>In short, unpleasant as was my predicament, at best, I sawmuch reason to congratulate myself that I was on the losingside, rather than the triumphant one. If, heretofore, I had beennone of the warmest of partisans, I began now, at this seasonof peril and adversity, to be pretty acutely sensible with whichparty my predilections lay; nor was it without something likeregret and shame, that, according to a reasonable calculation ofchances, I saw my own prospect of retaining office to be betterthan those of my Democratic brethren. But who can see aninch into futurity, beyond his nose? My own head was thefirst that fell!</p><p>The moment when a man's head drops off is seldom or never,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>I am inclined to think, precisely the most agreeable of his life.Nevertheless, like the greater part of our misfortunes, even soserious a contingency brings its remedy and consolation with it,if the sufferer will but make the best, rather than the worst,of the accident which has befallen him. In my particular case,the consolatory topics were close at hand, and, indeed, had suggestedthemselves to my meditations a considerable time beforeit was requisite to use them. In view of my previous wearinessof office, and vague thoughts of resignation, my fortune somewhatresembled that of a person who should entertain an ideaof committing suicide, and, although beyond his hopes, meetwith the good hap to be murdered. In the Custom-House, asbefore in the Old Manse, I had spent three years; a term longenough to rest a weary brain; long enough to break off oldintellectual habits, and make room for new ones; long enough,and too long, to have lived in an unnatural state, doing whatwas really of no advantage nor delight to any human being, andwithholding myself from toil that would, at least, have stilledan unquiet impulse in me. Then, moreover, as regarded hisunceremonious ejectment, the late Surveyor was not altogetherill-pleased to be recognized by the Whigs as an enemy; sincehis inactivity in political affairs—his tendency to roam, at will,in that broad and quiet field where all mankind may meet, ratherthan confine himself to those narrow paths where brethren of thesame household must diverge from one another—had sometimesmade it questionable with his brother Democrats whether he wasa friend. Now, after he had won the crown of martyrdom (thoughwith no longer a head to wear it on), the point might be lookedupon as settled. Finally, little heroic as he was, it seemed moredecorous to be overthrown in the downfall of the party with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>which he had been content to stand, than to remain a forlornsurvivor, when so many worthier men were falling; and, at last,after subsisting for four years on the mercy of a hostile administration,to be compelled then to define his position anew, andclaim the yet more humiliating mercy of a friendly one.</p><p>Meanwhile the press had taken up my affair, and kept me,for a week or two, careering through the public prints, in mydecapitated state, like Irving's Headless Horseman; ghastly andgrim, and longing to be buried, as a politically dead man ought.So much for my figurative self. The real human being, all thistime, with his head safely on his shoulders, had brought himselfto the comfortable conclusion that everything was for the best;and, making an investment in ink, paper, and steel-pens, hadopened his long-disused writing-desk, and was again a literaryman.</p><p>Now it was that the lucubrations of my ancient predecessor,Mr. Surveyor Pue, came into play. Rusty through long idleness,some little space was requisite before my intellectual machinerycould be brought to work upon the tale, with an effectin any degree satisfactory. Even yet, though my thoughts wereultimately much absorbed in the task, it wears, to my eye, astern and sombre aspect; too much ungladdened by genial sunshine;too little relieved by the tender and familiar influenceswhich soften almost every scene of nature and real life, and,undoubtedly, should soften every picture of them. This uncaptivatingeffect is perhaps due to the period of hardly accomplishedrevolution, and still seething turmoil, in which the story shapeditself. It is no indication, however, of a lack of cheerfulnessin the writer's mind; for he was happier, while straying throughthe gloom of these sunless fantasies, than at any time since he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>had quitted the Old Manse. Some of the briefer articles, whichcontribute to make up the volume, have likewise been writtensince my involuntary withdrawal from the toils and honors ofpublic life, and the remainder are gleaned from annuals and magazinesof such antique date that they have gone round the circle,and come back to novelty again.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25344/25344-h/25344-h.htm#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Keeping up the metaphor ofthe political guillotine, the whole may be considered as the <span class="smcap">PosthumousPapers of a Decapitated Surveyor</span>; and the sketchwhich I am now bringing to a close, if too autobiographical fora modest person to publish in his lifetime, will readily be excusedin a gentleman who writes from beyond the grave.

It is with an effortthat I recall the figures and appellations of these few. Soon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>likewise, my old native town will loom upon me through thehaze of memory, a mist brooding over and around it; as if itwere no portion of the real earth, but an overgrown village incloud-land, with only imaginary inhabitants to people its woodenhouses, and walk its homely lanes, and the unpicturesque prolixityof its main street.

In accordancewith this rule, it may safely be assumed that the forefathers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>of Boston had built the first prison-house somewhere in the vicinityof Cornhill, almost as seasonably as they marked out the first burial-ground,on Isaac Johnson's lot, and round about his grave, whichsubsequently became the nucleus of all the congregated sepulchresin the old churchyard of King's Chapel. Certain it is, that,some fifteen or twenty years after the settlement of the town, thewooden jail was already marked with weather-stains and otherindications of age, which gave a yet darker aspect to its beetle-browedand gloomy front. The rust on the ponderous iron-workof its oaken door looked more antique than anything else in theNew World. Like all that pertains to crime, it seemed never tohave known a youthful era. Before this ugly edifice, and betweenit and the wheel-track of the street, was a grass-plot, much overgrownwith burdock, pigweed, apple-peru, and such unsightlyvegetation, which evidently found something congenial in the soilthat had so early borne the black flower of civilized society, aprison. But on one side of the portal, and rooted almost at thethreshold, was a wild rose-bush, covered, in this month of June,with its delicate gems, which might be imagined to offer theirfragrance and fragile beauty to the prisoner as he went in, and tothe condemned criminal as he came forth to his doom, in tokenthat the deep heart of Nature could pity and be kind to him.</p><p>This rose-bush, by a strange chance, has been kept alive in history;but whether it had merely survived out of the stern oldwilderness, so long after the fall of the gigantic pines and oaksthat originally overshadowed it,—or whether, as there is fairauthority for believing, it had sprung up under the footstepsof the sainted Ann Hutchinson, as she entered the prison-door,—weshall not take upon us to determine. Finding it so directlyon the threshold of our narrative, which is now about to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>issue from that inauspicious portal, we could hardly do otherwisethan pluck one of its flowers, and present it to the reader.It may serve, let us hope, to symbolize some sweet moral blossom,that may be found along the track, or relieve the darkeningclose of a tale of human frailty and sorrow.</p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px; padding-top: 1em"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_053.jpg" width="300" height="217" alt="" title=""></div><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; padding-top: 4em"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/ornament_iii.jpg" width="400" height="111" alt="" title=""></div><h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II.</h2><h4>THE MARKET-PLACE.</h4><div class="initial"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/initial_t.jpg" alt="T" title="T"></div><p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">he</span> grass-plot before the jail, in Prison Lane,on a certain summer morning, not less thantwo centuries ago, was occupied by a prettylarge number of the inhabitants of Boston;all with their eyes intently fastened on theiron-clamped oaken door. Amongst anyother population, or at a later period in the history of New England,the grim rigidity that petrified the bearded physiognomiesof these good people would have augured some awful businessin hand. It could have betokened nothing short of the anticipatedexecution of some noted culprit, on whom the sentenceof a legal tribunal had but confirmed the verdict of public sentiment.But, in that early severity of the Puritan character, aninference of this kind could not so indubitably be drawn. Itmight be that a sluggish bond-servant, or an undutiful child,whom his parents had given over to the civil authority, was tobe corrected at the whipping-post. It might be, that an Antinomian,a Quaker, or other heterodox religionist was to bescourged out of the town, or an idle and vagrant Indian, whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>the white man's fire-water had made riotous about the streets,was to be driven with stripes into the shadow of the forest. Itmight be, too, that a witch, like old Mistress Hibbins, thebitter-tempered widow of the magistrate, was to die upon thegallows. In either case, there was very much the same solemnityof demeanor on the part of the spectators; as befitted apeople amongst whom religion and law were almost identical,and in whose character both were so thoroughly interfused, thatthe mildest and the severest acts of public discipline were alikemade venerable and awful. Meagre, indeed, and cold was thesympathy that a transgressor might look for, from such bystanders,at the scaffold. On the other hand, a penalty, which, in ourdays, would infer a degree of mocking infamy and ridicule, mightthen be invested with almost as stern a dignity as the punishmentof death itself.</p><p>It was a circumstance to be noted, on the summer morningwhen our story begins its course, that the women, of whomthere were several in the crowd, appeared to take a peculiarinterest in whatever penal infliction might be expected to ensue.The age had not so much refinement, that any sense of improprietyrestrained the wearers of petticoat and farthingale fromstepping forth into the public ways, and wedging their notunsubstantial persons, if occasion were, into the throng nearest tothe scaffold at an execution. Morally, as well as materially, therewas a coarser fibre in those wives and maidens of old Englishbirth and breeding, than in their fair descendants, separatedfrom them by a series of six or seven generations; for, throughoutthat chain of ancestry, every successive mother has transmittedto her child a fainter bloom, a more delicate and brieferbeauty, and a slighter physical frame, if not a character of less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>force and solidity, than her own. The women who were nowstanding about the prison-door stood within less than half acentury of the period when the man-like Elizabeth had beenthe not altogether unsuitable representative of the sex. Theywere her countrywomen; and the beef and ale of their nativeland, with a moral diet not a whit more refined, entered largelyinto their composition. The bright morning sun, therefore, shoneon broad shoulders and well-developed busts, and on round andruddy cheeks, that had ripened in the far-off island, and hadhardly yet grown paler or thinner in the atmosphere of NewEngland. There was, moreover, a boldness and rotundity ofspeech among these matrons, as most of them seemed to be,that would startle us at the present day, whether in respect toits purport or its volume of tone.</p><p>“Goodwives,” said a hard-featured dame of fifty, “I'll tellye a piece of my mind. It would be greatly for the publicbehoof, if we women, being of mature age and church-membersin good repute, should have the handling of such malefactressesas this Hester Prynne. What think ye, gossips? If the hussystood up for judgment before us five, that are now here in aknot together, would she come off with such a sentence as theworshipful magistrates have awarded? Marry, I trow not!”</p><p>“People say,” said another, “that the Reverend Master Dimmesdale,her godly pastor, takes it very grievously to heart that sucha scandal should have come upon his congregation.”</p><p>“The magistrates are God-fearing gentlemen, but mercifulovermuch,—that is a truth,” added a third autumnal matron.“At the very least, they should have put the brand of a hotiron on Hester Prynne's forehead. Madam Hester would havewinced at that, I warrant me. But she,—the naughty baggage,—little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>will she care what they put upon the bodice of hergown! Why, look you, she may cover it with a brooch, orsuch like heathenish adornment, and so walk the streets as braveas ever!”</p><p>“Ah, but,” interposed, more softly, a young wife, holdinga child by the hand, “let her coverthe mark as she will, the pang of itwill be always in her heart.”</p><div class="backright" style="background-image: url(images/illu_057.jpg); height: 100%;"><div class="sandbag" style="width:500px; height:269px;"> </div><div class="sandbag" style="width:185px; height:125px;"> </div><p>“What do we talk of marks andbrands, whether on the bodice of hergown, or the flesh of her forehead?” cried another female, theugliest as well as the most pitiless of these self-constituted judges.“This woman has brought shame upon us all, and ought to die.Is there not law for it? Truly, there is, both in the Scriptureand the statute-book. Then let the magistrates, who havemade it of no effect, thank themselves if their own wives anddaughters go astray!”</p><p>“Mercy on us, goodwife,” exclaimed a man in the crowd,“is there no virtue in woman, save what springs from a wholesome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>fear of the gallows? That is the hardest word yet!Hush, now, gossips! for the lock is turning in the prison-door,and here comes Mistress Prynne herself.”</p><p>The door of the jail being flung open from within, thereappeared, in the first place, like a black shadow emerging intosunshine, the grim and grisly presence of the town-beadle, witha sword by his side, and his staff of office in his hand. Thispersonage prefigured and represented in his aspect the wholedismal severity of the Puritanic code of law, which it was hisbusiness to administer in its final and closest application to theoffender. Stretching forth the official staff in his left hand, helaid his right upon the shoulder of a young woman, whom hethus drew forward; until, on the threshold of the prison-door,she repelled him, by an action marked with natural dignity andforce of character, and stepped into the open air, as if by herown free will. She bore in her arms a child, a baby of somethree months old, who winked and turned aside its little facefrom the too vivid light of day; because its existence, heretofore,had brought it acquainted only with the gray twilight ofa dungeon, or other darksome apartment of the prison.</p></div><p>When the young woman—the mother of this child—stoodfully revealed before the crowd, it seemed to be her first impulseto clasp the infant closely to her bosom; not so much byan impulse of motherly affection, as that she might thereby conceala certain token, which was wrought or fastened into herdress. In a moment, however, wisely judging that one token ofher shame would but poorly serve to hide another, she took thebaby on her arm, and, with a burning blush, and yet a haughtysmile, and a glance that would not be abashed, looked aroundat her towns-people and neighbors. On the breast of her gown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>in fine red cloth, surrounded with an elaborate embroidery andfantastic flourishes of gold-thread, appeared the letter A. It wasso artistically done, and with so much fertility and gorgeousluxuriance of fancy, that it had all the effect of a last and fittingdecoration to the apparel which she wore; and which was ofa splendor in accordance with the taste of the age, but greatlybeyond what was allowed by the sumptuary regulations of thecolony.</p><p>The young woman was tall, with a figure of perfect eleganceon a large scale. She had dark and abundant hair, so glossythat it threw off the sunshine with a gleam, and a face which,besides being beautiful from regularity of feature and richnessof complexion, had the impressiveness belonging to a markedbrow and deep black eyes. She was lady-like, too, after themanner of the feminine gentility of those days; characterized bya certain state and dignity, rather than by the delicate, evanescent,and indescribable grace, which is now recognized as itsindication. And never had Hester Prynne appeared more lady-like,in the antique interpretation of the term, than as she issuedfrom the prison. Those who had before known her, and hadexpected to behold her dimmed and obscured by a disastrouscloud, were astonished, and even startled, to perceive how herbeauty shone out, and made a halo of the misfortune and ignominyin which she was enveloped. It may be true, that, to asensitive observer, there was something exquisitely painful in it.Her attire, which, indeed, she had wrought for the occasion, inprison, and had modelled much after her own fancy, seemed toexpress the attitude of her spirit, the desperate recklessness ofher mood, by its wild and picturesque peculiarity. But the pointwhich drew all eyes, and, as it were, transfigured the wearer,—so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>that both men and women, who had been familiarly acquaintedwith Hester Prynne, were now impressed as if they beheld herfor the first time,—was that <span class="smcap">Scarlet Letter</span>, so fantasticallyembroidered and illuminated upon her bosom. It had the effectof a spell, taking her out of the ordinary relations with humanity,and enclosing her in a sphere by herself.</p><p>“She hath good skill at her needle, that's certain,” remarkedone of her female spectators; “but did ever a woman, beforethis brazen hussy, contrive such a way of showing it! Why,gossips, what is it but to laugh in the faces of our godly magistrates,and make a pride out of what they, worthy gentlemen,meant for a punishment?”</p><p>“It were well,” muttered the most iron-visaged of the olddames, “if we stripped Madam Hester's rich gown off herdainty shoulders; and as for the red letter, which she hathstitched so curiously, I'll bestow a rag of mine own rheumaticflannel, to make a fitter one!”</p><p>“O, peace, neighbors, peace!” whispered their youngest companion;“do not let her hear you! Not a stitch in thatembroidered letter but she has felt it in her heart.”</p><p>The grim beadle now made a gesture with his staff.</p><p>“Make way, good people, make way, in the King's name!”cried he. “Open a passage; and, I promise ye, Mistress Prynneshall be set where man, woman, and child may have a fair sightof her brave apparel, from this time till an hour past meridian.A blessing on the righteous Colony of the Massachusetts, whereiniquity is dragged out into the sunshine! Come along, MadamHester, and show your scarlet letter in the market-place!”</p><p>A lane was forthwith opened through the crowd of spectators.Preceded by the beadle, and attended by an irregular procession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>of stern-browed men and unkindly visaged women, Hester Prynneset forth towards the place appointed for her punishment. Acrowd of eager and curious school-boys, understanding little ofthe matter in hand, except that it gave them a half-holiday, ranbefore her progress, turning their heads continually to stare intoher face, and at the winking baby in her arms, and at the ignominiousletter on her breast. It was no great distance, in thosedays, from the prison-door to the market-place. Measured bythe prisoner's experience, however, it might be reckoned a journeyof some length; for, haughty as her demeanor was, sheperchance underwent an agony from every footstep of those thatthronged to see her, as if her heart had been flung into thestreet for them all to spurn and trample upon. In our nature,however, there is a provision, alike marvellous and merciful, thatthe sufferer should never know the intensity of what he enduresby its present torture, but chiefly by the pang that rankles afterit. With almost a serene deportment, therefore, Hester Prynnepassed through this portion of her ordeal, and came to a sort ofscaffold, at the western extremity of the market-place. It stoodnearly beneath the eaves of Boston's earliest church, and appearedto be a fixture there.</p><p>In fact, this scaffold constituted a portion of a penal machine,which now, for two or three generations past, has been merelyhistorical and traditionary among us, but was held, in the oldtime, to be as effectual an agent, in the promotion of good citizenship,as ever was the guillotine among the terrorists of France.It was, in short, the platform of the pillory; and above it rosethe framework of that instrument of discipline, so fashioned asto confine the human head in its tight grasp, and thus hold itup to the public gaze. The very ideal of ignominy was embodied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>and made manifest in this contrivance of wood and iron.There can be no outrage, methinks, against our commonnature,—whatever be the delinquencies of the individual,—nooutrage more flagrant than to forbid the culprit to hide his facefor shame; as it was the essence of this punishment to do. InHester Prynne's instance, however, as not unfrequently in othercases, her sentence bore, that she should stand a certain timeupon the platform, but without undergoing that gripe about theneck and confinement of the head, the proneness to which wasthe most devilish characteristic of this ugly engine. Knowingwell her part, she ascended a flight of wooden steps, and wasthus displayed to the surrounding multitude, at about the heightof a man's shoulders above the street.</p><p>Had there been a Papist among the crowd of Puritans, hemight have seen in this beautiful woman, so picturesque in herattire and mien, and with the infant at her bosom, an object toremind him of the image of Divine Maternity, which so manyillustrious painters have vied with one another to represent;something which should remind him, indeed, but only by contrast,of that sacred image of sinless motherhood, whose infantwas to redeem the world. Here, there was the taint of deepestsin in the most sacred quality of human life, working such effect,that the world was only the darker for this woman's beauty,and the more lost for the infant that she had borne.</p><p>The scene was not without a mixture of awe, such as mustalways invest the spectacle of guilt and shame in a fellow-creature,before society shall have grown corrupt enough to smile,instead of shuddering, at it. The witnesses of Hester Prynne'sdisgrace had not yet passed beyond their simplicity. They werestern enough to look upon her death, had that been the sentence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>without a murmur at its severity, but had none of the heartlessnessof another social state, which would find only a themefor jest in an exhibition like the present. Even had there beena disposition to turn the matter into ridicule, it must have beenrepressed and overpowered by the solemn presence of men noless dignified than the Governor, and several of his counsellors,a judge, a general, and the ministers of the town; all of whomsat or stood in a balcony of the meeting-house, looking downupon the platform. When such personages could constitute apart of the spectacle, without risking the majesty or reverenceof rank and office, it was safely to be inferred that the inflictionof a legal sentence would have an earnest and effectualmeaning. Accordingly, the crowd was sombre and grave. Theunhappy culprit sustained herself as best a woman might, underthe heavy weight of a thousand unrelenting eyes, all fastenedupon her, and concentrated at her bosom. It was almost intolerableto be borne. Of an impulsive and passionate nature, shehad fortified herself to encounter the stings and venomous stabsof public contumely, wreaking itself in every variety of insult;but there was a quality so much more terrible in the solemnmood of the popular mind, that she longed rather to behold allthose rigid countenances contorted with scornful merriment, andherself the object. Had a roar of laughter burst from the multitude,—eachman, each woman, each little shrill-voiced child,contributing their individual parts,—Hester Prynne might haverepaid them all with a bitter and disdainful smile. But, underthe leaden infliction which it was her doom to endure, she felt,at moments, as if she must needs shriek out with the full powerof her lungs, and cast herself from the scaffold down upon theground, or else go mad at once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p><p>Yet there were intervals when the whole scene, in which shewas the most conspicuous object, seemed to vanish from hereyes, or, at least, glimmered indistinctly before them, like amass of imperfectly shaped and spectral images. Her mind,and especially her memory, was preternaturally active, and keptbringing up other scenes than this roughly hewn street of alittle town, on the edge of the Western wilderness; other facesthan were lowering upon her from beneath the brims of thosesteeple-crowned hats. Reminiscences the most trifling and immaterial,passages of infancy and school-days, sports, childishquarrels, and the little domestic traits of her maiden years, cameswarming back upon her, intermingled with recollections of whateverwas gravest in her subsequent life; one picture preciselyas vivid as another; as if all were of similar importance, or allalike a play. Possibly, it was an instinctive device of her spirit,to relieve itself, by the exhibition of these phantasmagoric forms,from the cruel weight and hardness of the reality.</p><p>Be that as it might, the scaffold of the pillory was a pointof view that revealed to Hester Prynne the entire track alongwhich she had been treading, since her happy infancy. Standingon that miserable eminence, she saw again her native village,in Old England, and her paternal home; a decayed house ofgray stone, with a poverty-stricken aspect, but retaining a half-obliteratedshield of arms over the portal, in token of antiquegentility. She saw her father's face, with its bald brow, andreverend white beard, that flowed over the old-fashioned Elizabethanruff; her mother's, too, with the look of heedful andanxious love which it always wore in her remembrance, and which,face, glowing with girlish beauty, and illuminating all the interioreven since her death, had so often laid the impediment of a gentleremonstrance in her daughter's pathway. She saw her ownof the dusky mirror in which she had been wont to gaze at it.There she beheld another countenance, of a man well strickenin years, a pale, thin, scholar-like visage, with eyes dim andbleared by the lamplight that had served them to pore overmany ponderous books. Yet those same bleared optics had astrange, penetrating power, when it was their owner's purpose toread the human soul. This figure of the study and the cloister,as Hester Prynne's womanly fancy failed not to recall, wasslightly deformed, with the left shoulder a trifle higher thanthe right. Next rose before her, in memory's picture-gallery,the intricate and narrow thoroughfares, the tall, gray houses,the huge cathedrals, and the public edifices, ancient in date andquaint in architecture, of a Continental city; where a new lifehad awaited her, still in connection with the misshapen scholar;a new life, but feeding itself on time-worn materials, like a tuftof green moss on a crumbling wall. Lastly, in lieu of theseshifting scenes, came back the rude market-place of the Puritansettlement, with all the towns-people assembled and levelling theirstern regards at Hester Prynne,—yes, at herself,—who stoodon the scaffold of the pillory, an infant on her arm, and the letterA, in scarlet, fantastically embroidered with gold-thread, uponher bosom!</p><p class="figcenter"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25344/25344-h/images/illu_065.jpg"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_065_th.jpg" alt="Standing on the Miserable Eminence" title="Standing on the Miserable Eminence"></a></p><p>Could it be true?

An Indian, in his nativegarb, was standing there; but the red men were not so infrequentvisitors of the English settlements, that one of them would haveattracted any notice from Hester Prynne, at such a time; muchless would he have excluded all other objects and ideas fromher mind. By the Indian's side, and evidently sustaining acompanionship with him, stood a white man, clad in a strangedisarray of civilized and savage costume.</p><p>He was small in stature, with a furrowed visage, which, as yet,could hardly be termed aged. There was a remarkable intelligencein his features, as of a person who had so cultivated his mentalpart that it could not fail to mould the physical to itself, andbecome manifest by unmistakable tokens. Although, by a seeminglycareless arrangement of his heterogeneous garb, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>endeavored to conceal or abate the peculiarity, it was sufficientlyevident to Hester Prynne, that one of this man's shoulders rosehigher than the other. Again, at the first instant of perceivingthat thin visage, and the slight deformity of the figure, shepressed her infant to her bosom with so convulsive a force thatthe poor babe uttered another cry of pain. But the mother didnot seem to hear it.</p><p>At his arrival in the market-place, and some time before shesaw him, the stranger had bent his eyes on Hester Prynne. Itwas carelessly, at first, like a man chiefly accustomed to lookinward, and to whom external matters are of little value andimport, unless they bear relation to something within his mind.Very soon, however, his look became keen and penetrative. Awrithing horror twisted itself across his features, like a snakegliding swiftly over them, and making one little pause, with allits wreathed intervolutions in open sight. His face darkenedwith some powerful emotion, which, nevertheless, he so instantaneouslycontrolled by an effort of his will, that, save at asingle moment, its expression might have passed for calmness.After a brief space, the convulsion grew almost imperceptible,and finally subsided into the depths of his nature. When hefound the eyes of Hester Prynne fastened on his own, and sawthat she appeared to recognize him, he slowly and calmly raisedhis finger, made a gesture with it in the air, and laid it on hislips.</p><p>Then, touching the shoulder of a townsman who stood nextto him, he addressed him, in a formal and courteous manner.</p><p>“I pray you, good Sir,” said he, “who is this woman?—andwherefore is she here set up to public shame?”</p><p>“You must needs be a stranger in this region, friend,” answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>the townsman, looking curiously at the questioner andhis savage companion, “else you would surely have heard ofMistress Hester Prynne, and her evil doings. She hath raiseda great scandal, I promise you, in godly Master Dimmesdale'schurch.”</p><p>“You say truly,” replied the other. “I am a stranger, andhave been a wanderer, sorely against my will. I have met withgrievous mishaps by sea and land, and have been long held inbonds among the heathen-folk, to the southward; and am nowbrought hither by this Indian, to be redeemed out of my captivity.Will it please you, therefore, to tell me of HesterPrynne's,—have I her name rightly?—of this woman's offences,and what has brought her to yonder scaffold?”</p><p>“Truly, friend; and methinks it must gladden your heart, afteryour troubles and sojourn in the wilderness,” said the townsman,“to find yourself, at length, in a land where iniquity is searchedout, and punished in the sight of rulers and people; as here inour godly New England. Yonder woman, Sir, you must know,was the wife of a certain learned man, English by birth, but whohad long dwelt in Amsterdam, whence, some good time agone,he was minded to cross over and cast in his lot with us of theMassachusetts. To this purpose, he sent his wife before him,remaining himself to look after some necessary affairs. Marry,good Sir, in some two years, or less, that the woman has beena dweller here in Boston, no tidings have come of this learnedgentleman, Master Prynne; and his young wife, look you, beingleft to her own misguidance—”</p><p>“Ah!—aha!—I conceive you,” said the stranger, with a bittersmile. “So learned a man as you speak of should have learnedthis too in his books. And who, by your favor, Sir, may be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>father of yonder babe—it is some three or four months old, Ishould judge—which Mistress Prynne is holding in her arms?”</p><p>“Of a truth, friend, that matter remaineth a riddle; and theDaniel who shall expound it is yet a-wanting,” answered the townsman.“Madam Hester absolutely refuseth to speak, and themagistrates have laid their heads together in vain. Peradventurethe guilty one stands looking on at this sad spectacle, unknownof man, and forgetting that God sees him.”</p><p>“The learned man,” observed the stranger, with another smile,“should come himself, to look into the mystery.”</p><p>“It behooves him well, if he be still in life,” responded thetownsman. “Now, good Sir, our Massachusetts magistracy,bethinking themselves that this woman is youthful and fair, anddoubtless was strongly tempted to her fall,—and that, moreover,as is most likely, her husband may be at the bottom of the sea,—theyhave not been bold to put in force the extremity of ourrighteous law against her. The penalty thereof is death. Butin their great mercy and tenderness of heart, they have doomedMistress Prynne to stand only a space of three hours on theplatform of the pillory, and then and thereafter, for the remainderof her natural life, to wear a mark of shame upon her bosom.”</p><p>“A wise sentence!” remarked the stranger, gravely bowing hishead. “Thus she will be a living sermon against sin, until theignominious letter be engraved upon her tombstone. It irks me,nevertheless, that the partner of her iniquity should not, at least,stand on the scaffold by her side. But he will be known!—hewill be known!—he will be known!”</p><p>He bowed courteously to the communicative townsman, and,whispering a few words to his Indian attendant, they both madetheir way through the crowd.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p><p>While this passed, Hester Prynne had been standing on herpedestal, still with a fixed gaze towards the stranger; so fixed agaze, that, at moments of intense absorption, all other objectsin the visible world seemed to vanish, leaving only him and her.Such an interview, perhaps, would have been more terrible thaneven to meet him as she now did, with the hot, mid-day sunburning down upon her face, and lighting up its shame; withthe scarlet token of infamy on her breast; with the sin-borninfant in her arms; with a whole people, drawn forth as to afestival, staring at the features that should have been seen onlyin the quiet gleam of the fireside, in the happy shadow of ahome, or beneath a matronly veil, at church. Dreadful as itwas, she was conscious of a shelter in the presence of thesethousand witnesses. It was better to stand thus, with so manybetwixt him and her, than to greet him, face to face, they twoalone. She fled for refuge, as it were, to the public exposure,and dreaded the moment when its protection should be withdrawnfrom her. Involved in these thoughts, she scarcely hearda voice behind her, until it had repeated her name more thanonce, in a loud and solemn tone, audible to the whole multitude.</p><p>“Hearken unto me, Hester Prynne!” said the voice.</p><p>It has already been noticed, that directly over the platformon which Hester Prynne stood was a kind of balcony, or opengallery, appended to the meeting-house. It was the place whenceproclamations were wont to be made, amidst an assemblage ofthe magistracy, with all the ceremonial that attended such publicobservances in those days. Here, to witness the scene whichwe are describing, sat Governor Bellingham himself, with foursergeants about his chair, bearing halberds, as a guard of honor.He wore a dark feather in his hat, a border of embroidery on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>his cloak, and a black velvet tunic beneath; a gentleman advancedin years, with a hard experience written in his wrinkles.He was not ill fitted to be the head and representative of a community,which owed its origin and progress, and its presentstate of development, not to the impulses of youth, but to thestern and tempered energies of manhood, and the sombre sagacityof age; accomplishing so much, precisely because it imaginedand hoped so little. The other eminent characters, by whomthe chief ruler was surrounded, were distinguished by a dignityof mien, belonging to a period when the forms of authority werefelt to possess the sacredness of Divine institutions. They were,doubtless, good men, just and sage. But, out of the wholehuman family, it would not have been easy to select the samenumber of wise and virtuous persons, who should be less capableof sitting in judgment on an erring woman's heart, and disentanglingits mesh of good and evil, than the sages of rigid aspecttowards whom Hester Prynne now turned her face. She seemedconscious, indeed, that whatever sympathy she might expect layin the larger and warmer heart of the multitude; for, as shelifted her eyes towards the balcony, the unhappy woman grewpale and trembled.</p><p>The voice which had called her attention was that of thereverend and famous John Wilson, the eldest clergyman of Boston,a great scholar, like most of his contemporaries in the profession,and withal a man of kind and genial spirit. This lastattribute, however, had been less carefully developed than hisintellectual gifts, and was, in truth, rather a matter of shamethan self-congratulation with him. There he stood, with a borderof grizzled locks beneath his skull-cap; while his gray eyes,accustomed to the shaded light of his study, were winking, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>those of Hester's infant, in the unadulterated sunshine. He lookedlike the darkly engraved portraits which we see prefixed to oldvolumes of sermons; and had no more right than one of thoseportraits would have, to step forth, as he now did, and meddlewith a question of human guilt, passion, and anguish.</p><p>“Hester Prynne,” said the clergyman, “I have striven withmy young brother here, under whose preaching of the word youhave been privileged to sit,”—here Mr. Wilson laid his handon the shoulder of a pale young man beside him,—“I havesought, I say, to persuade this godly youth, that he should dealwith you, here in the face of Heaven, and before these wiseand upright rulers, and in hearing of all the people, as touchingthe vileness and blackness of your sin. Knowing your naturaltemper better than I, he could the better judge what argumentsto use, whether of tenderness or terror, such as might prevailover your hardness and obstinacy; insomuch that you shouldno longer hide the name of him who tempted you to this grievousfall. But he opposes to me (with a young man's over-softness,albeit wise beyond his years), that it were wronging thevery nature of woman to force her to lay open her heart's secretsin such broad daylight, and in presence of so great a multitude.Truly, as I sought to convince him, the shame lay in the commissionof the sin, and not in the showing of it forth. Whatsay you to it, once again, Brother Dimmesdale? Must it bethou, or I, that shall deal with this poor sinner's soul?”</p><p>There was a murmur among the dignified and reverend occupantsof the balcony; and Governor Bellingham gave expressionto its purport, speaking in an authoritative voice, although temperedwith respect towards the youthful clergyman whom headdressed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p><p>“Good Master Dimmesdale,” said he, “the responsibility ofthis woman's soul lies greatly with you. It behooves you, therefore,to exhort her to repentance, and to confession, as a proofand consequence thereof.”</p><p>The directness of this appeal drew the eyes of the whole crowdupon the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale; a young clergyman, whohad come from one of the great English universities, bringingall the learning of the age into our wild forest-land. His eloquenceand religious fervor had already given the earnest ofhigh eminence in his profession. He was a person of very strikingaspect, with a white, lofty, and impending brow, large brown,melancholy eyes, and a mouth which, unless when he forciblycompressed it, was apt to be tremulous, expressing both nervoussensibility and a vast power of self-restraint. Notwithstandinghis high native gifts and scholar-like attainments, there was anair about this young minister,—an apprehensive, a startled, ahalf-frightened look,—as of a being who felt himself quiteastray and at a loss in the pathway of human existence, andcould only be at ease in some seclusion of his own. Therefore,so far as his duties would permit, he trod in the shadowy by-paths,and thus kept himself simple and childlike; coming forth,when occasion was, with a freshness, and fragrance, and dewypurity of thought, which, as many people said, affected themlike the speech of an angel.</p><p>Such was the young man whom the Reverend Mr. Wilsonand the Governor had introduced so openly to the public notice,bidding him speak, in the hearing of all men, to that mysteryof a woman's soul, so sacred even in its pollution. The tryingnature of his position drove the blood from his cheek, and madehis lips tremulous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p><p>“Speak to the woman, my brother,” said Mr. Wilson. “Itis of moment to her soul, and therefore, as the worshipful Governorsays, momentous to thine own, in whose charge hers is.Exhort her to confess the truth!”</p><p>The Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale bent his head, in silent prayer,as it seemed, and then came forward.</p><p>“Hester Prynne,” said he, leaning over the balcony and lookingdown steadfastly into her eyes, “thou hearest what this goodman says, and seest the accountability under which I labor. Ifthou feelest it to be for thy soul's peace, and that thy earthlypunishment will thereby be made more effectual to salvation, Icharge thee to speak out the name of thy fellow-sinner and fellow-sufferer!Be not silent from any mistaken pity and tendernessfor him; for, believe me, Hester, though he were to step downfrom a high place, and stand there beside thee, on thy pedestalof shame, yet better were it so than to hide a guilty heart throughlife. What can thy silence do for him, except it tempt him—yea,compel him, as it were—to add hypocrisy to sin? Heavenhath granted thee an open ignominy, that thereby thou mayestwork out an open triumph over the evil within thee, and thesorrow without. Take heed how thou deniest to him—who,perchance, hath not the courage to grasp it for himself—thebitter, but wholesome, cup that is now presented to thy lips!”</p><p>The young pastor's voice was tremulously sweet, rich, deep,and broken. The feeling that it so evidently manifested, ratherthan the direct purport of the words, caused it to vibrate withinall hearts, and brought the listeners into one accord of sympathy.Even the poor baby, at Hester's bosom, was affected bythe same influence; for it directed its hitherto vacant gazetowards Mr. Dimmesdale, and held up its little arms, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>half-pleased, half-plaintive murmur. So powerful seemed theminister's appeal, that the people could not believe but thatHester Prynne would speak out the guilty name; or else thatthe guilty one himself, in whatever high or lowly place he stood,would be drawn forth by an inward and inevitable necessity,and compelled to ascend to the scaffold.</p><p>Hester shook her head.</p><p>“Woman, transgress not beyond the limits of Heaven'smercy!” cried the Reverend Mr. Wilson, more harshly thanbefore. “That little babe hath been gifted with a voice, to secondand confirm the counsel which thou hast heard. Speak outthe name! That, and thy repentance, may avail to take thescarlet letter off thy breast.”</p><p>“Never!” replied Hester Prynne, looking, not at Mr. Wilson,but into the deep and troubled eyes of the younger clergyman.“It is too deeply branded. Ye cannot take it off. Andwould that I might endure his agony, as well as mine!”</p><p>“Speak, woman!” said another voice, coldly and sternly,proceeding from the crowd about the scaffold. “Speak; andgive your child a father!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p><div class="backleft" style="background-image: url(images/illu_078.jpg); height: 100%;"><div class="sandbag-left" style="width:300px; height:170px;"> </div><div class="sandbag-left" style="width:245px; height:230px;"> </div><p>“I will not speak!” answered Hester, turning pale as death,but responding to this voice, which she too surely recognized.“And my child must seek a heavenly Father; she shall neverknow an earthly one!”</p><p>“She will not speak!” murmured Mr. Dimmesdale, who,leaning over the balcony, with his hand upon his heart, hadawaited the result of his appeal. He now drew back, with along respiration. “Wondrous strength and generosity of a woman'sheart! She will not speak!”</p><p>Discerning the impracticable state of the poor culprit's mind,the elder clergyman, who had carefully prepared himself for theoccasion, addressed to the multitude a discourse on sin, in allits branches, but with continual reference to the ignominiousletter. So forcibly did he dwell upon this symbol, for the houror more during which his periods were rolling over the people'sheads, that itassumed newterrors intheir imagination,andseemed to deriveits scarlethue fromthe flames ofthe infernal pit. HesterPrynne, meanwhile,kept her place upon thepedestal of shame, withglazed eyes, and an airof weary indifference.She had borne, thatmorning, all that naturecould endure; and asher temperament wasnot of the order thatescapes from too intense suffering by a swoon, her spirit couldonly shelter itself beneath a stony crust of insensibility, whilethe faculties of animal life remained entire. In this state, thevoice of the preacher thundered remorselessly, but unavailingly,upon her ears. The infant, during the latter portion of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>ordeal, pierced the air with its wailings and screams; she stroveto hush it, mechanically, but seemed scarcely to sympathize withits trouble. With the same hard demeanor, she was led back toprison, and vanished from the public gaze within its iron-clampedportal. It was whispered, by those who peered after her, thatthe scarlet letter threw a lurid gleam along the dark passage-wayof the interior.</p></div><div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px; padding-top: 1em"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_79.jpg" width="300" height="222" alt="" title=""></div><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; padding-top: 4em"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/ornament_iv.jpg" width="400" height="111" alt="" title=""></div><h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV.</h2><h4>THE INTERVIEW.</h4><div class="initial"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/initial_a.jpg" alt="A" title="A"></div><p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">fter</span> her return to the prison, Hester Prynnewas found to be in a state of nervous excitementthat demanded constant watchfulness,lest she should perpetrate violence on herself,or do some half-frenzied mischief to the poorbabe. As night approached, it proving impossibleto quell her insubordination by rebuke or threats of punishment,Master Brackett, the jailer, thought fit to introduce aphysician. He described him as a man of skill in all Christianmodes of physical science, and likewise familiar with whateverthe savage people could teach, in respect to medicinal herbs androots that grew in the forest. To say the truth, there was muchneed of professional assistance, not merely for Hester herself,but still more urgently for the child; who, drawing its sustenancefrom the maternal bosom, seemed to have drank in with itall the turmoil, the anguish and despair, which pervaded themother's system. It now writhed in convulsions of pain, andwas a forcible type, in its little frame, of the moral agony whichHester Prynne had borne throughout the day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p><p>Closely following the jailer into the dismal apartment appearedthat individual, of singular aspect, whose presence in the crowdhad been of such deep interest to the wearer of the scarlet letter.He was lodged in the prison, not as suspected of any offence,but as the most convenient and suitable mode of disposing ofhim, until the magistrates should have conferred with the Indiansagamores respecting his ransom. His name was announced asRoger Chillingworth. The jailer, after ushering him into theroom, remained a moment, marvelling at the comparative quietthat followed his entrance; for Hester Prynne had immediatelybecome as still as death, although the child continued to moan.</p><p>“Prithee, friend, leave me alone with my patient,” said thepractitioner. “Trust me, good jailer, you shall briefly havepeace in your house; and, I promise you, Mistress Prynne shallhereafter be more amenable to just authority than you may havefound her heretofore.”</p><p>“Nay, if your worship can accomplish that,” answered MasterBrackett, “I shall own you for a man of skill indeed! Verily,the woman hath been like a possessed one; and there lacks little,that I should take in hand to drive Satan out of her with stripes.”</p><p>The stranger had entered the room with the characteristicquietude of the profession to which he announced himself asbelonging. Nor did his demeanor change, when the withdrawalof the prison-keeper left him face to face with the woman, whoseabsorbed notice of him, in the crowd, had intimated so close a relationbetween himself and her. His first care was given to thechild; whose cries, indeed, as she lay writhing on the trundle-bed,made it of peremptory necessity to postpone all other businessto the task of soothing her. He examined the infant carefully,and then proceeded to unclasp a leathern case, which he took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>from beneath his dress. It appeared to contain medical preparations,one of which he mingled with a cup of water.</p><p>“My old studies in alchemy,” observed he, “and my sojourn,for above a year past, among a people well versed in the kindlyproperties of simples, have made a better physician of me thanmany that claim the medical degree. Here, woman! The childis yours,—she is none of mine,—neither will she recognize myvoice or aspect as a father's. Administer this draught, therefore,with thine own hand.”</p><p>Hester repelled the offered medicine, at the same time gazingwith strongly marked apprehension into his face.</p><p>“Wouldst thou avenge thyself on the innocent babe?” whisperedshe.</p><p>“Foolish woman!” responded the physician, half coldly, halfsoothingly. “What should ail me, to harm this misbegottenand miserable babe? The medicine is potent for good; and wereit my child,—yea, mine own, as well as thine!—I could do nobetter for it.”</p><p>As she still hesitated, being, in fact, in no reasonable state ofmind, he took the infant in his arms, and himself administeredthe draught. It soon proved its efficacy, and redeemed theleech's pledge. The moans of the little patient subsided; itsconvulsive tossings gradually ceased; and, in a few moments, asis the custom of young children after relief from pain, it sank intoa profound and dewy slumber. The physician, as he had a fairright to be termed, next bestowed his attention on the mother.With calm and intent scrutiny he felt her pulse, looked into hereyes,—a gaze that made her heart shrink and shudder, becauseso familiar, and yet so strange and cold,—and, finally, satisfiedwith his investigation, proceeded to mingle another draught.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p><p>“I know not Lethe nor Nepenthe,” remarked he; “but Ihave learned many new secrets in the wilderness, and here isone of them,—a recipe that an Indian taught me, in requitalof some lessons of my own, that were as old as Paracelsus. Drinkit! It may be less soothing than a sinless conscience. That Icannot give thee. But it will calm the swell and heaving of thypassion, like oil thrown on the waves of a tempestuous sea.”</p><p>He presented the cup to Hester, who received it with a slow,earnest look into his face; not precisely a look of fear, yet fullof doubt and questioning, as to what his purposes might be.She looked also at her slumbering child.</p><p>“I have thought of death,” said she,—“have wished for it,—wouldeven have prayed for it, were it fit that such as Ishould pray for anything. Yet if death be in this cup, I bidthee think again, ere thou beholdest me quaff it. See! It iseven now at my lips.”</p><p>“Drink, then,” replied he, still with the same cold composure.“Dost thou know me so little, Hester Prynne? Are my purposeswont to be so shallow? Even if I imagine a scheme ofvengeance, what could I do better for my object than to letthee live,—than to give thee medicines against all harm andperil of life,—so that this burning shame may still blaze uponthy bosom?” As he spoke, he laid his long forefinger on thescarlet letter, which forthwith seemed to scorch into Hester'sbreast, as if it had been red-hot. He noticed her involuntarygesture, and smiled. “Live, therefore, and bear about thy doomwith thee, in the eyes of men and women,—in the eyes of himwhom thou didst call thy husband,—in the eyes of yonderchild! And, that thou mayest live, take off this draught.”</p><p>Without further expostulation or delay, Hester Prynne drained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>the cup, and, at the motion of the man of skill, seated herselfon the bed where the child was sleeping; while he drew the onlychair which the room afforded, and took his own seat beside her.She could not but tremble at these preparations; for she feltthat—having now done all that humanity or principle, or, if soit were, a refined cruelty, impelled him to do, for the relief ofphysical suffering—he was next to treat with her as the manwhom she had most deeply and irreparably injured.</p><p>“Hester,” said he, “I ask not wherefore, nor how, thou hastfallen into the pit, or say, rather, thou hast ascended to thepedestal of infamy, on which I found thee. The reason is notfar to seek. It was my folly, and thy weakness. I,—a manof thought,—the bookworm of great libraries,—a man alreadyin decay, having given my best years to feed the hungry dreamof knowledge,—what had I to do with youth and beauty likethine own! Misshapen from my birth-hour, how could I deludemyself with the idea that intellectual gifts might veil physicaldeformity in a young girl's fantasy! Men call me wise. Ifsages were ever wise in their own behoof, I might have foreseenall this. I might have known that, as I came out of the vastand dismal forest, and entered this settlement of Christian men,the very first object to meet my eyes would be thyself, HesterPrynne, standing up, a statue of ignominy, before the people.Nay, from the moment when we came down the old church stepstogether, a married pair, I might have beheld the bale-fire ofthat scarlet letter blazing at the end of our path!”</p><p>“Thou knowest,” said Hester,—for, depressed as she was, shecould not endure this last quiet stab at the token of her shame,—“thouknowest that I was frank with thee. I felt no love,nor feigned any.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>”</p><p>“True,” replied he. “It was my folly! I have said it. But,up to that epoch of my life, I had lived in vain. The worldhad been so cheerless! My heart was a habitation large enoughfor many guests, but lonely and chill, and without a householdfire. I longed to kindle one! It seemed not so wild a dream,—oldas I was, and sombre as I was, and misshapen as I was,—thatthe simple bliss, which is scattered far and wide, for allmankind to gather up, might yet be mine. And so, Hester, Idrew thee into my heart, into its innermost chamber, and soughtto warm thee by the warmth which thy presence made there!”</p><p>“I have greatly wronged thee,” murmured Hester.</p><p>“We have wronged each other,” answered he. “Mine wasthe first wrong, when I betrayed thy budding youth into a falseand unnatural relation with my decay. Therefore, as a man whohas not thought and philosophized in vain, I seek no vengeance,plot no evil against thee. Between thee and me the scale hangsfairly balanced. But, Hester, the man lives who has wronged usboth! Who is he?”</p><p>“Ask me not!” replied Hester Prynne, looking firmly into hisface. “That thou shalt never know!”</p><p>“Never, sayest thou?” rejoined he, with a smile of dark andself-relying intelligence. “Never know him! Believe me, Hester,there are few things,—whether in the outward world, or, toa certain depth, in the invisible sphere of thought,—few thingshidden from the man who devotes himself earnestly and unreservedlyto the solution of a mystery. Thou mayest cover upthy secret from the prying multitude. Thou mayest conceal it,too, from the ministers and magistrates, even as thou didst thisday, when they sought to wrench the name out of thy heart, andgive thee a partner on thy pedestal. But, as for me, I come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>the inquest with other senses than they possess. I shall seekthis man, as I have sought truth in books; as I have soughtgold in alchemy. There is a sympathy that will make me consciousof him. I shall see him tremble. I shall feel myselfshudder, suddenly and unawares. Sooner or later, he must needsbe mine!”</p><p>The eyes of the wrinkled scholar glowed so intensely upon her,that Hester Prynne clasped her hands over her heart, dreadinglest he should read the secret there at once.</p><p>“Thou wilt not reveal his name? Not the less he is mine,”resumed he, with a look of confidence, as if destiny were at onewith him. “He bears no letter of infamy wrought into his garment,as thou dost; but I shall read it on his heart. Yet fearnot for him! Think not that I shall interfere with Heaven'sown method of retribution, or, to my own loss, betray him to thegripe of human law. Neither do thou imagine that I shall contriveaught against his life; no, nor against his fame, if, as Ijudge, he be a man of fair repute. Let him live! Let himhide himself in outward honor, if he may! Not the less heshall be mine!”</p><p>“Thy acts are like mercy,” said Hester, bewildered and appalled.“But thy words interpret thee as a terror!”</p><p>“One thing, thou that wast my wife, I would enjoin uponthee,” continued the scholar. “Thou hast kept the secret of thyparamour. Keep, likewise, mine! There are none in this landthat know me. Breathe not, to any human soul, that thou didstever call me husband! Here, on this wild outskirt of the earth,I shall pitch my tent; for, elsewhere a wanderer, and isolatedfrom human interests, I find here a woman, a man, a child,amongst whom and myself there exist the closest ligaments. Nomatter whether of love or hate; no matter whether of right orwrong! Thou and thine, Hester Prynne, belong to me. Myhome is where thou art, and where he is.

Her prison-door was thrownopen, and she came forth into the sunshine,which, falling on all alike, seemed, to hersick and morbid heart, as if meant for noother purpose than to reveal the scarlet letteron her breast. Perhaps there was a more real torture in herfirst unattended footsteps from the threshold of the prison, thaneven in the procession and spectacle that have been described,where she was made the common infamy, at which all mankindwas summoned to point its finger. Then, she was supported byan unnatural tension of the nerves, and by all the combativeenergy of her character, which enabled her to convert the sceneinto a kind of lurid triumph. It was, moreover, a separate andinsulated event, to occur but once in her lifetime, and to meetwhich, therefore, reckless of economy, she might call up the vitalstrength that would have sufficed for many quiet years. Thevery law that condemned her—a giant of stern features, butwith vigor to support, as well as to annihilate, in his iron arm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>—hadheld her up, through the terrible ordeal of her ignominy.But now, with this unattended walk from her prison-door, beganthe daily custom; and she must either sustain and carry itforward by the ordinary resources of her nature, or sink beneathit. She could no longer borrow from the future to help herthrough the present grief. To-morrow would bring its own trialwith it; so would the next day, and so would the next; each itsown trial, and yet the very same that was now so unutterablygrievous to be borne. The days of the far-off future would toilonward, still with the same burden for her to take up, and bearalong with her, but never to fling down; for the accumulatingdays, and added years, would pile up their misery upon the heapof shame. Throughout them all, giving up her individuality, shewould become the general symbol at which the preacher andmoralist might point, and in which they might vivify and embodytheir images of woman's frailty and sinful passion. Thus theyoung and pure would be taught to look at her, with the scarletletter flaming on her breast,—at her, the child of honorableparents,—at her, the mother of a babe, that would hereafter bea woman,—at her, who had once been innocent,—as the figure,the body, the reality of sin. And over her grave, the infamy thatshe must carry thither would be her only monument.</p><p>It may seem marvellous, that, with the world before her,—keptby no restrictive clause of her condemnation within thelimits of the Puritan settlement, so remote and so obscure,—freeto return to her birthplace, or to any other European land,and there hide her character and identity under a new exterior,as completely as if emerging into another state of being,—andhaving also the passes of the dark, inscrutable forest open toher, where the wildness of her nature might assimilate itself with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>a people whose customs and life were alien from the law thathad condemned her,—it may seem marvellous, that this womanshould still call that place her home, where, and where only, shemust needs be the type of shame. But there is a fatality, a feelingso irresistible and inevitable that it has the force of doom,which almost invariably compels human beings to linger aroundand haunt, ghost-like, the spot where some great and markedevent has given the color to their lifetime; and still the moreirresistibly, the darker the tinge that saddens it. Her sin, herignominy, were the roots which she had struck into the soil.It was as if a new birth, with stronger assimilations than thefirst, had converted the forest-land, still so uncongenial to everyother pilgrim and wanderer, into Hester Prynne's wild and dreary,but life-long home. All other scenes of earth—even that villageof rural England, where happy infancy and stainless maidenhoodseemed yet to be in her mother's keeping, like garments putoff long ago—were foreign to her, in comparison. The chainthat bound her here was of iron links, and galling to her inmostsoul, but could never be broken.</p><p>It might be, too,—doubtless it was so, although she hid thesecret from herself, and grew pale whenever it struggled outof her heart, like a serpent from its hole,—it might be thatanother feeling kept her within the scene and pathway that hadbeen so fatal. There dwelt, there trode the feet of one withwhom she deemed herself connected in a union, that, unrecognizedon earth, would bring them together before the bar offinal judgment, and make that their marriage-altar, for a jointfuturity of endless retribution. Over and over again, the tempterof souls had thrust this idea upon Hester's contemplation, andlaughed at the passionate and desperate joy with which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>seized, and then strove to cast it from her. She barely lookedthe idea in the face, and hastened to bar it in its dungeon. Whatshe compelled herself to believe—what, finally, she reasonedupon, as her motive for continuing a resident of New England—washalf a truth, and half a self-delusion. Here, shesaid to herself, had been the scene of her guilt, and here shouldbe the scene of her earthly punishment; and so, perchance, thetorture of her daily shame would at length purge her soul, andwork out another purity than that which she had lost; moresaint-like, because the result of martyrdom.</p><p class="figcenter"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25344/25344-h/images/illu_093.jpg"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_093_th.jpg" alt="The Lonesome Dwelling" title="The Lonesome Dwelling"></a></p><p>Hester Prynne, therefore, did not flee. On the outskirts of thetown, within the verge of the peninsula, but not in close vicinityto any other habitation, there was a small thatched cottage. Ithad been built by an earlier settler, and abandoned because thesoil about it was too sterile for cultivation, while its comparativeremoteness put it out of the sphere of that social activitywhich already marked the habits of the emigrants. It stood onthe shore, looking across a basin of the sea at the forest-coveredhills, towards the west. A clump of scrubby trees, such as alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>grew on the peninsula, did not so much conceal the cottagefrom view, as seem to denote that here was some object whichwould fain have been, or at least ought to be, concealed. Inthis little, lonesome dwelling, with some slender means that shepossessed, and by the license of the magistrates, who still keptan inquisitorial watch over her, Hester established herself, withher infant child. A mystic shadow of suspicion immediatelyattached itself to the spot. Children, too young to comprehendwherefore this woman should be shut out from the sphereof human charities, would creep nigh enough to behold herplying her needle at the cottage-window, or standing in thedoorway, or laboring in her little garden, or coming forth alongthe pathway that led townward; and, discerning the scarletletter on her breast, would scamper off with a strange, contagiousfear.</p><p>Lonely as was Hester's situation, and without a friend onearth who dared to show himself, she, however, incurred no riskof want. She possessed an art that sufficed, even in a land thatafforded comparatively little scope for its exercise, to supply foodfor her thriving infant and herself. It was the art—then, asnow, almost the only one within a woman's grasp—of needlework.She bore on her breast, in the curiously embroideredletter, a specimen of her delicate and imaginative skill, of whichthe dames of a court might gladly have availed themselves, toadd the richer and more spiritual adornment of human ingenuityto their fabrics of silk and gold. Here, indeed, in the sablesimplicity that generally characterized the Puritanic modes ofdress, there might be an infrequent call for the finer productionsof her handiwork. Yet the taste of the age, demanding whateverwas elaborate in compositions of this kind, did not fail to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>extend its influence over our stern progenitors, who had castbehind them so many fashions which it might seem harder todispense with. Public ceremonies, such as ordinations, the installationof magistrates, and all that could give majesty to the formsin which a new government manifested itself to the people, were,as a matter of policy, marked by a stately and well-conductedceremonial, and a sombre, but yet a studied magnificence. Deepruffs, painfully wrought bands, and gorgeously embroidered gloves,were all deemed necessary to the official state of men assumingthe reins of power; and were readily allowed to individualsdignified by rank or wealth, even while sumptuary laws forbadethese and similar extravagances to the plebeian order. In thearray of funerals, too,—whether for the apparel of the deadbody, or to typify, by manifold emblematic devices of sable clothand snowy lawn, the sorrow of the survivors,—there was a frequentand characteristic demand for such labor as Hester Prynnecould supply. Baby-linen—for babies then wore robes of state—affordedstill another possibility of toil and emolument.</p><p>By degrees, nor very slowly, her handiwork became what wouldnow be termed the fashion. Whether from commiseration fora woman of so miserable a destiny; or from the morbid curiositythat gives a fictitious value even to common or worthlessthings; or by whatever other intangible circumstance was then,as now, sufficient to bestow, on some persons, what others mightseek in vain; or because Hester really filled a gap which mustotherwise have remained vacant; it is certain that she had readyand fairly requited employment for as many hours as she sawfit to occupy with her needle. Vanity, it may be, chose tomortify itself, by putting on, for ceremonials of pomp and state,the garments that had been wrought by her sinful hands. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>needlework was seen on the ruff of the Governor; military menwore it on their scarfs, and the minister on his band; it deckedthe baby's little cap; it was shut up, to be mildewed and moulderaway, in the coffins of the dead. But it is not recorded that,in a single instance, her skill was called in aid to embroiderthe white veil which was to cover the pure blushes of a bride.The exception indicated the ever-relentless rigor with which societyfrowned upon her sin.</p><p>Hester sought not to acquire anything beyond a subsistence,of the plainest and most ascetic description, for herself, anda simple abundance for her child. Her own dress was of thecoarsest materials and the most sombre hue; with only that oneornament,—the scarlet letter,—which it was her doom to wear.The child's attire, on the other hand, was distinguished by afanciful, or, we might rather say, a fantastic ingenuity, whichserved, indeed, to heighten the airy charm that early began todevelop itself in the little girl, but which appeared to have alsoa deeper meaning. We may speak further of it hereafter. Exceptfor that small expenditure in the decoration of her infant, Hesterbestowed all her superfluous means in charity, on wretches lessmiserable than herself, and who not unfrequently insulted thehand that fed them. Much of the time, which she might readilyhave applied to the better efforts of her art, she employed inmaking coarse garments for the poor. It is probable that therewas an idea of penance in this mode of occupation, and that sheoffered up a real sacrifice of enjoyment, in devoting so manyhours to such rude handiwork. She had in her nature a rich,voluptuous, Oriental characteristic,—a taste for the gorgeouslybeautiful, which, save in the exquisite productions of her needle,found nothing else, in all the possibilities of her life, to exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>itself upon. Women derive a pleasure, incomprehensible tothe other sex, from the delicate toil of the needle. To HesterPrynne it might have been a mode of expressing, and thereforesoothing, the passion of her life. Like all other joys, she rejectedit as sin. This morbid meddling of conscience with an immaterialmatter betokened, it is to be feared, no genuine and steadfastpenitence, but something doubtful, something that mightbe deeply wrong, beneath.</p><p>In this manner, Hester Prynne came to have a part to performin the world. With her native energy of character, and rarecapacity, it could not entirely cast her off, although it had seta mark upon her, more intolerable to a woman's heart than thatwhich branded the brow of Cain. In all her intercourse withsociety, however, there was nothing that made her feel as if shebelonged to it. Every gesture, every word, and even the silenceof those with whom she came in contact, implied, and oftenexpressed, that she was banished, and as much alone as if sheinhabited another sphere, or communicated with the commonnature by other organs and senses than the rest of human kind.She stood apart from moral interests, yet close beside them, likea ghost that revisits the familiar fireside, and can no longer makeitself seen or felt; no more smile with the household joy, normourn with the kindred sorrow; or, should it succeed in manifestingits forbidden sympathy, awakening only terror and horriblerepugnance. These emotions, in fact, and its bitterest scornbesides, seemed to be the sole portion that she retained in theuniversal heart. It was not an age of delicacy; and her position,although she understood it well, and was in little dangerof forgetting it, was often brought before her vivid self-perception,like a new anguish, by the rudest touch upon the tenderest spot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>The poor, as we have already said, whom she sought out to bethe objects of her bounty, often reviled the hand that was stretchedforth to succor them. Dames of elevated rank, likewise, whosedoors she entered in the way of her occupation, were accustomedto distil drops of bitterness into her heart; sometimes throughthat alchemy of quiet malice, by which women can concoct asubtle poison from ordinary trifles; and sometimes, also, bya coarser expression, that fell upon the sufferer's defencelessbreast like a rough blow upon an ulcerated wound. Hester hadschooled herself long and well; she never responded to theseattacks, save by a flush of crimson that rose irrepressibly overher pale cheek, and again subsided into the depths of her bosom.She was patient,—a martyr, indeed,—but she forbore to prayfor her enemies; lest, in spite of her forgiving aspirations, thewords of the blessing should stubbornly twist themselves intoa curse.</p><p>Continually, and in a thousand other ways, did she feel theinnumerable throbs of anguish that had been so cunningly contrivedfor her by the undying, the ever-active sentence of thePuritan tribunal. Clergymen paused in the street to addresswords of exhortation, that brought a crowd, with its mingledgrin and frown, around the poor, sinful woman. If she entereda church, trusting to share the Sabbath smile of the UniversalFather, it was often her mishap to find herself the text of thediscourse. She grew to have a dread of children; for they hadimbibed from their parents a vague idea of something horriblein this dreary woman, gliding silently through the town, withnever any companion but one only child. Therefore, first allowingher to pass, they pursued her at a distance with shrill cries,and the utterance of a word that had no distinct purport totheir own minds, but was none the less terrible to her, as proceedingfrom lips that babbled it unconsciously. It seemed toargue so wide a diffusion of her shame, that all nature knewof it; it could have caused her no deeper pang, had the leavesof the trees whispered the dark story among themselves,—hadthe summer breeze murmured about it,—had the wintry blastshrieked it aloud! Another peculiar torture was felt in the gazeof a new eye. When strangers looked curiously at the scarletletter,—and none ever failed to do so,—they branded it afreshinto Hester's soul; so that, oftentimes, she could scarcely refrain,yet always did refrain, from covering the symbol with her hand.But then, again, an accustomed eye had likewise its own anguishto inflict. Its cool stare of familiarity was intolerable. Fromfirst to last, in short, Hester Prynne had always this dreadfulagony in feeling a human eye upon the token; the spot nevergrew callous; it seemed, on the contrary, to grow more sensitivewith daily torture.</p><p class="figcenter"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25344/25344-h/images/illu_099.jpg"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_099_th.jpg" alt="Lonely Footsteps" title="Lonely Footsteps"></a></p><p>But sometimes, once in many days, or perchance in manymonths, she felt an eye—a human eye—upon the ignominiousbrand, that seemed to give a momentary relief, as if half of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>agony were shared. The next instant, back it all rushed again,with still a deeper throb of pain; for, in that brief interval,she had sinned anew. Had Hester sinned alone?</p><p>Her imagination was somewhat affected, and, had she been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>of a softer moral and intellectual fibre, would have been stillmore so, by the strange and solitary anguish of her life. Walkingto and fro, with those lonely footsteps, in the little worldwith which she was outwardly connected, it now and then appearedto Hester,—if altogether fancy, it was nevertheless too potentto be resisted,—she felt or fancied, then, that the scarlet letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>had endowed her with a new sense. She shuddered to believe,yet could not help believing, that it gave her a sympatheticknowledge of the hidden sin in other hearts. She was terror-strickenby the revelations that were thus made. What werethey? Could they be other than the insidious whispers of thebad angel, who would fain have persuaded the struggling woman,as yet only half his victim, that the outward guise of puritywas but a lie, and that, if truth were everywhere to be shown,a scarlet letter would blaze forth on many a bosom besides HesterPrynne's? Or, must she receive those intimations—so obscure,yet so distinct—as truth? In all her miserable experience, therewas nothing else so awful and so loathsome as this sense. Itperplexed, as well as shocked her, by the irreverent inopportunenessof the occasions that brought it into vivid action. Sometimesthe red infamy upon her breast would give a sympatheticthrob, as she passed near a venerable minister or magistrate,the model of piety and justice, to whom that age of antiquereverence looked up, as to a mortal man in fellowship with angels.“What evil thing is at hand?” would Hester say to herself.Lifting her reluctant eyes, there would be nothing human withinthe scope of view, save the form of this earthly saint! Again,a mystic sisterhood would contumaciously assert itself, as shemet the sanctified frown of some matron, who, according to therumor of all tongues, had kept cold snow within her bosomthroughout life. That unsunned snow in the matron's bosom,and the burning shame on Hester Prynne's,—what had the twoin common? Or, once more, the electric thrill would give herwarning,—“Behold, Hester, here is a companion!”—and, lookingup, she would detect the eyes of a young maiden glancingat the scarlet letter, shyly and aside, and quickly averted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>a faint, chill crimson in her cheeks; as if her purity were somewhatsullied by that momentary glance. O Fiend, whose talismanwas that fatal symbol, wouldst thou leave nothing, whether inyouth or age, for this poor sinner to revere?—such loss of faithis ever one of the saddest results of sin. Be it accepted as a proofthat all was not corrupt in this poor victim of her own frailty,and man's hard law, that Hester Prynne yet struggled to believethat no fellow-mortal was guilty like herself.</p><p>The vulgar, who, in those dreary old times, were always contributinga grotesque horror to what interested their imaginations,had a story about the scarlet letter which we might readily workup into a terrific legend. They averred, that the symbol wasnot mere scarlet cloth, tinged in an earthly dye-pot, but wasred-hot with infernal fire, and could be seen glowing all alight,whenever Hester Prynne walked abroad in the night-time. Andwe must needs say, it seared Hester's bosom so deeply, thatperhaps there was more truth in the rumor than our modernincredulity may be inclined to admit.</p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; padding-top: 1em"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_103.jpg" width="400" height="114" alt="" title=""></div><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; padding-top: 4em"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/ornament_iii.jpg" width="400" height="111" alt="Vignette" title="Vignette"></div><h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI.</h2><h4>PEARL.</h4><div class="initial" style="width: 164px;"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_104.jpg" width="164" height="245" alt="" title=""></div><p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">We</span> have as yet hardly spokenof the infant; that little creature,whose innocent life hadsprung, by the inscrutable decreeof Providence, a lovelyand immortal flower, out ofthe rank luxuriance of a guiltypassion. How strange it seemedto the sad woman, as shewatched the growth, and thebeauty that became every daymore brilliant, and the intelligencethat threw its quiveringsunshine over the tiny featuresof this child! Her Pearl!—Forso had Hester called her;not as a name expressive of her aspect, which had nothing ofthe calm, white, unimpassioned lustre that would be indicatedby the comparison. But she named the infant “Pearl,” as being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>of great price,—purchased with all she had,—her mother's onlytreasure! How strange, indeed! Man had marked this woman'ssin by a scarlet letter, which had such potent and disastrousefficacy that no human sympathy could reach her, save it weresinful like herself. God, as a direct consequence of the sin whichman thus punished, had given her a lovely child, whose placewas on that same dishonored bosom, to connect her parent foreverwith the race and descent of mortals, and to be finally a blessedsoul in heaven! Yet these thoughts affected Hester Prynne lesswith hope than apprehension. She knew that her deed had beenevil; she could have no faith, therefore, that its result wouldbe good. Day after day, she looked fearfully into the child'sexpanding nature, ever dreading to detect some dark and wildpeculiarity, that should correspond with the guiltiness to whichshe owed her being.</p><p>Certainly, there was no physical defect. By its perfect shape,its vigor, and its natural dexterity in the use of all its untriedlimbs, the infant was worthy to have been brought forth in Eden;worthy to have been left there, to be the plaything of the angels,after the world's first parents were driven out. The child had anative grace which does not invariably coexist with faultlessbeauty; its attire, however simple, always impressed the beholderas if it were the very garb that precisely became it best. Butlittle Pearl was not clad in rustic weeds. Her mother, with amorbid purpose that may be better understood hereafter, hadbought the richest tissues that could be procured, and allowedher imaginative faculty its full play in the arrangement and decorationof the dresses which the child wore, before the public eye.So magnificent was the small figure, when thus arrayed, and suchwas the splendor of Pearl's own proper beauty, shining through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>the gorgeous robes which might have extinguished a paler loveliness,that there was an absolute circle of radiance around her,on the darksome cottage floor. And yet a russet gown, tornand soiled with the child's rude play, made a picture of her justas perfect. Pearl's aspect was imbued with a spell of infinitevariety; in this one child there were many children, comprehendingthe full scope between the wild-flower prettiness of apeasant-baby, and the pomp, in little, of an infant princess.Throughout all, however, there was a trait of passion, a certaindepth of hue, which she never lost; and if, in any of her changes,she had grown fainter or paler, she would have ceased to be herself,—itwould have been no longer Pearl!</p><p>This outward mutability indicated, and did not more than fairlyexpress, the various properties of her inner life. Her natureappeared to possess depth, too, as well as variety; but—or elseHester's fears deceived her—it lacked reference and adaptationto the world into which she was born. The child could not bemade amenable to rules. In giving her existence, a great lawhad been broken; and the result was a being whose elementswere perhaps beautiful and brilliant, but all in disorder; or withan order peculiar to themselves, amidst which the point of varietyand arrangement was difficult or impossible to be discovered.Hester could only account for the child's character—and eventhen most vaguely and imperfectly—by recalling what she herselfhad been, during that momentous period while Pearl wasimbibing her soul from the spiritual world, and her bodily framefrom its material of earth. The mother's impassioned state hadbeen the medium through which were transmitted to the unborninfant the rays of its moral life; and, however white and clearoriginally, they had taken the deep stains of crimson and gold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>the fiery lustre, the black shadow, and the untempered light ofthe intervening substance. Above all, the warfare of Hester'sspirit, at that epoch, was perpetuated in Pearl. She could recognizeher wild, desperate, defiant mood, the flightiness of hertemper, and even some of the very cloud-shapes of gloom anddespondency that had brooded in her heart. They were nowilluminated by the morning radiance of a young child's disposition,but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolificof the storm and whirlwind.</p><p>The discipline of the family, in those days, was of a far morerigid kind than now. The frown, the harsh rebuke, the frequentapplication of the rod, enjoined by Scriptural authority, wereused, not merely in the way of punishment for actual offences,but as a wholesome regimen for the growth and promotion of allchildish virtues. Hester Prynne, nevertheless, the lonely motherof this one child, ran little risk of erring on the side of undueseverity. Mindful, however, of her own errors and misfortunes,she early sought to impose a tender, but strict control over theinfant immortality that was committed to her charge. But thetask was beyond her skill. After testing both smiles and frowns,and proving that neither mode of treatment possessed any calculableinfluence, Hester was ultimately compelled to stand aside,and permit the child to be swayed by her own impulses. Physicalcompulsion or restraint was effectual, of course, while itlasted. As to any other kind of discipline, whether addressedto her mind or heart, little Pearl might or might not be withinits reach, in accordance with the caprice that ruled the moment.Her mother, while Pearl was yet an infant, grew acquainted witha certain peculiar look, that warned her when it would be laborthrown away to insist, persuade, or plead. It was a look so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>intelligent, yet inexplicable, so perverse, sometimes so malicious,but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits, that Hestercould not help questioning, at such moments, whether Pearl werea human child. She seemed rather an airy sprite, which, afterplaying its fantastic sports for a little while upon the cottagefloor, would flit away with a mocking smile. Whenever thatlook appeared in her wild, bright, deeply black eyes, it investedher with a strange remoteness and intangibility; it was as if shewere hovering in the air and might vanish, like a glimmeringlight, that comes we know not whence, and goes we know notwhither. Beholding it, Hester was constrained to rush towardsthe child,—to pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariablybegan,—to snatch her to her bosom, with a close pressureand earnest kisses,—not so much from overflowing love, as toassure herself that Pearl was flesh and blood, and not utterlydelusive. But Pearl's laugh, when she was caught, though full ofmerriment and music, made her mother more doubtful than before.</p><p>Heart-smitten at this bewildering and baffling spell, that sooften came between herself and her sole treasure, whom she hadbought so dear, and who was all her world, Hester sometimesburst into passionate tears. Then, perhaps,—for there was noforeseeing how it might affect her,—Pearl would frown, andclench her little fist, and harden her small features into a stern,unsympathizing look of discontent. Not seldom, she would laughanew, and louder than before, like a thing incapable and unintelligentof human sorrow. Or—but this more rarely happened—shewould be convulsed with a rage of grief, and sobout her love for her mother, in broken words, and seem intenton proving that she had a heart, by breaking it. Yet Hesterwas hardly safe in confiding herself to that gusty tenderness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>it passed, as suddenly as it came. Brooding over all thesematters, the mother felt like one who has evoked a spirit, but,by some irregularity in the process of conjuration, has failed towin the master-word that should control this new and incomprehensibleintelligence. Her only real comfort was when the childlay in the placidity of sleep. Then she was sure of her, andtasted hours of quiet, sad, delicious happiness; until—perhapswith that perverse expression glimmering from beneath her openinglids—little Pearl awoke!</p><p>How soon—with what strange rapidity, indeed!—did Pearlarrive at an age that was capable of social intercourse, beyondthe mother's ever-ready smile and nonsense-words! And thenwhat a happiness would it have been, could Hester Prynne haveheard her clear, bird-like voice mingling with the uproar ofother childish voices, and have distinguished and unravelled herown darling's tones, amid all the entangled outcry of a group ofsportive children! But this could never be. Pearl was a bornoutcast of the infantile world. An imp of evil, emblem andproduct of sin, she had no right among christened infants. Nothingwas more remarkable than the instinct, as it seemed, withwhich the child comprehended her loneliness; the destiny thathad drawn an inviolable circle round about her; the whole peculiarity,in short, of her position in respect to other children.Never, since her release from prison, had Hester met the publicgaze without her. In all her walks about the town, Pearl, too,was there; first as the babe in arms, and afterwards as the littlegirl, small companion of her mother, holding a forefinger withher whole grasp, and tripping along at the rate of three or fourfootsteps to one of Hester's. She saw the children of the settlement,on the grassy margin of the street, or at the domestic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>thresholds, disporting themselves in such grim fashion as thePuritanic nurture would permit; playing at going to church,perchance; or at scourging Quakers; or taking scalps in asham-fight with the Indians; or scaring one another with freaksof imitative witchcraft. Pearl saw, and gazed intently, but neversought to make acquaintance. If spoken to, she would not speakagain. If the children gathered about her, as they sometimes did,Pearl would grow positively terrible in her puny wrath, snatchingup stones to fling at them, with shrill, incoherent exclamations,that made her mother tremble, because they had so much thesound of a witch's anathemas in some unknown tongue.</p><p>The truth was, that the little Puritans, being of the most intolerantbrood that ever lived, had got a vague idea of somethingoutlandish, unearthly, or at variance with ordinary fashions, inthe mother and child; and therefore scorned them in their hearts,and not unfrequently reviled them with their tongues. Pearl feltthe sentiment, and requited it with the bitterest hatred that canbe supposed to rankle in a childish bosom. These outbreaks ofa fierce temper had a kind of value, and even comfort, for hermother; because there was at least an intelligible earnestnessin the mood, instead of the fitful caprice that so often thwartedher in the child's manifestations. It appalled her, nevertheless,to discern here, again, a shadowy reflection of the evil that hadexisted in herself. All this enmity and passion had Pearl inherited,by inalienable right, out of Hester's heart. Mother anddaughter stood together in the same circle of seclusion fromhuman society; and in the nature of the child seemed to beperpetuated those unquiet elements that had distracted HesterPrynne before Pearl's birth, but had since begun to be soothedaway by the softening influences of maternity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p><p>At home, within and around her mother's cottage, Pearl wantednot a wide and various circle of acquaintance. The spell of lifewent forth from her ever-creative spirit, and communicated itselfto a thousand objects, as a torch kindles a flame wherever itmay be applied. The unlikeliest materials—a stick, a bunchof rags, a flower—were the puppets of Pearl's witchcraft, and,without undergoing any outward change, became spirituallyadapted to whatever drama occupied the stage of her innerworld. Her one baby-voice served a multitude of imaginarypersonages, old and young, to talk withal. The pine-trees, aged,black and solemn, and flinging groans and other melancholyutterances on the breeze, needed little transformation to figureas Puritan elders; the ugliest weeds of the garden were theirchildren, whom Pearl smote down and uprooted, most unmercifully.It was wonderful, the vast variety of forms into whichshe threw her intellect, with no continuity, indeed, but dartingup and dancing, always in a state of preternatural activity,—soonsinking down, as if exhausted by so rapid and feverish atide of life,—and succeeded by other shapes of a similar wildenergy. It was like nothing so much as the phantasmagoric playof the northern lights. In the mere exercise of the fancy, however,and the sportiveness of a growing mind, there might belittle more than was observable in other children of bright faculties;except as Pearl, in the dearth of human playmates, wasthrown more upon the visionary throng which she created. Thesingularity lay in the hostile feelings with which the child regardedall these offspring of her own heart and mind. She never createda friend, but seemed always to be sowing broadcast the dragon'steeth, whence sprung a harvest of armed enemies, against whomshe rushed to battle. It was inexpressibly sad—then what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>depth of sorrow to a mother, who felt in her own heart thecause!—to observe, in one so young, this constant recognitionof an adverse world, and so fierce a training of the energies thatwere to make good her cause, in the contest that must ensue.</p><p>Gazing at Pearl, Hester Prynne often dropped her work uponher knees, and cried out with an agony which she would fainhave hidden, but which made utterance for itself, betwixt speechand a groan,—“O Father in Heaven,—if Thou art still myFather,—what is this being which I have brought into theworld!” And Pearl, overhearing the ejaculation, or aware, throughsome more subtile channel, of those throbs of anguish, would turnher vivid and beautiful little face upon her mother, smile withsprite-like intelligence, and resume her play.</p><p class="figcenter"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25344/25344-h/images/illu_113.jpg"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_113_th.jpg" alt="A Touch of Pearl&#39;s Baby Hand" title="A Touch of Pearl&#39;s Baby Hand"></a></p><p>One peculiarity of the child's deportment remains yet to betold. The very first thing which she had noticed in her life was—what?—notthe mother's smile, responding to it, as otherbabies do, by that faint, embryo smile of the little mouth, rememberedso doubtfully afterwards, and with such fond discussionwhether it were indeed a smile. By no means! But that firstobject of which Pearl seemed to become aware was—shall wesay it?—the scarlet letter on Hester's bosom! One day, asher mother stooped over the cradle, the infant's eyes had beencaught by the glimmering of the gold embroidery about the letter;and, putting up her little hand, she grasped at it, smiling, notdoubtfully, but with a decided gleam, that gave her face the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>look of a much older child. Then, gasping for breath, didHester Prynne clutch the fatal token, instinctively endeavoringto tear it away; so infinite was the torture inflicted by the intelligenttouch of Pearl's baby-hand. Again, as if her mother's agonizedgesture were meant only to make sport for her, did little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>Pearl look into her eyes, and smile! From that epoch, exceptwhen the child was asleep, Hester had never felt a moment'ssafety; not a moment's calm enjoyment of her. Weeks, it istrue, would sometimes elapse, during which Pearl's gaze mightnever once be fixed upon the scarlet letter; but then, again, itwould come at unawares, like the stroke of sudden death, andalways with that peculiar smile, and odd expression of the eyes.</p><p>Once, this freakish, elvish cast came into the child's eyes,while Hester was looking at her own image in them, as mothersare fond of doing; and, suddenly,—for women in solitude, andwith troubled hearts, are pestered with unaccountable delusions,—shefancied that she beheld, not her own miniature portrait, butanother face, in the small black mirror of Pearl's eye. It wasa face, fiend-like, full of smiling malice, yet bearing the semblanceof features that she had known full well, though seldom with asmile, and never with malice in them. It was as if an evil spiritpossessed the child, and had just then peeped forth in mockery.Many a time afterwards had Hester been tortured, though lessvividly, by the same illusion.</p><p>In the afternoon of a certain summer's day, after Pearl grewbig enough to run about, she amused herself with gatheringhandfuls of wild-flowers, and flinging them, one by one, at hermother's bosom; dancing up and down, like a little elf, whenevershe hit the scarlet letter. Hester's first motion had beento cover her bosom with her clasped hands. But, whether frompride or resignation, or a feeling that her penance might bestbe wrought out by this unutterable pain, she resisted the impulse,and sat erect, pale as death, looking sadly into little Pearl'swild eyes. Still came the battery of flowers, almost invariablyhitting the mark, and covering the mother's breast with hurts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>for which she could find no balm in this world, nor knew howto seek it in another. At last, her shot being all expended, thechild stood still and gazed at Hester, with that little, laughingimage of a fiend peeping out—or, whether it peeped or no,her mother so imagined it—from the unsearchable abyss of herblack eyes.</p><p>“Child, what art thou?” cried the mother.</p><p>“O, I am your little Pearl!” answered the child.</p><p>But, while she said it, Pearl laughed, and began to danceup and down, with the humorsome gesticulation of a little imp,whose next freak might be to fly up the chimney.</p><p>“Art thou my child, in very truth?” asked Hester.</p><p>Nor did she put the question altogether idly, but, for themoment, with a portion of genuine earnestness; for, such wasPearl's wonderful intelligence, that her mother half doubtedwhether she were not acquainted with the secret spell of herexistence, and might not now reveal herself.</p><p>“Yes; I am little Pearl!” repeated the child, continuingher antics.</p><p>“Thou art not my child! Thou art no Pearl of mine!”said the mother, half playfully; for it was often the case thata sportive impulse came over her, in the midst of her deepestsuffering. “Tell me, then, what thou art, and who sent theehither.”</p><p>“Tell me, mother!” said the child, seriously, coming up toHester, and pressing herself close to her knees. “Do thou tellme!”</p><p>“Thy Heavenly Father sent thee!” answered Hester Prynne.</p><p>But she said it with a hesitation that did not escape the acutenessof the child. Whether moved only by her ordinary freakishness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>or because an evil spirit prompted her, she put up hersmall forefinger, and touched the scarlet letter.</p><p>“He did not send me!” cried she, positively. “I have noHeavenly Father!”</p><p>“Hush, Pearl, hush! Thou must not talk so!” answeredthe mother, suppressing a groan. “He sent us all into thisworld. He sent even me, thy mother. Then, much more, thee!Or, if not, thou strange and elfish child, whence didst thoucome?”</p><p>“Tell me! Tell me!” repeated Pearl, no longer seriously,but laughing, and capering about the floor. “It is thou thatmust tell me!”</p><p>But Hester could not resolve the query, being herself in a dismallabyrinth of doubt. She remembered—betwixt a smile anda shudder—the talk of the neighboring towns-people; who, seekingvainly elsewhere for the child's paternity, and observing someof her odd attributes, had given out that poor little Pearl wasa demon offspring; such as, ever since old Catholic times, hadoccasionally been seen on earth, through the agency of theirmother's sin, and to promote some foul and wicked purpose.Luther, according to the scandal of his monkish enemies, wasa brat of that hellish breed; nor was Pearl the only child towhom this inauspicious origin was assigned, among the NewEngland Puritans.</p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px; padding-top: 1em"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_117.jpg" width="300" height="106" alt="" title=""></div><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; padding-top: 4em"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/ornament_vii.jpg" width="400" height="109" alt="Vignette" title="Vignette"></div><h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII.</h2><h4>THE GOVERNOR'S HALL.</h4><div class="initial" style="width: 200px;"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_118.jpg" width="200" height="201" alt="" title=""></div><p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">Hester Prynne</span>went, one day, to themansion of GovernorBellingham, with apair of gloves, whichshe had fringed andembroidered to his order,and which wereto be worn on somegreat occasion ofstate; for, though thechances of a popularelection had causedthis former ruler to descend a step or two from the highestrank, he still held an honorable and influential place among thecolonial magistracy.</p><p>Another and far more important reason than the delivery ofa pair of embroidered gloves impelled Hester, at this time, toseek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>in the affairs of the settlement. It had reached her ears, thatthere was a design on the part of some of the leading inhabitants,cherishing the more rigid order of principles in religion andgovernment, to deprive her of her child. On the suppositionthat Pearl, as already hinted, was of demon origin, these goodpeople not unreasonably argued that a Christian interest in themother's soul required them to remove such a stumbling-blockfrom her path. If the child, on the other hand, were reallycapable of moral and religious growth, and possessed the elementsof ultimate salvation, then, surely, it would enjoy all thefairer prospect of these advantages, by being transferred to wiserand better guardianship than Hester Prynne's. Among thosewho promoted the design, Governor Bellingham was said to beone of the most busy. It may appear singular, and indeed, nota little ludicrous, that an affair of this kind, which, in laterdays, would have been referred to no higher jurisdiction thanthat of the selectmen of the town, should then have been a questionpublicly discussed, and on which statesmen of eminence tooksides. At that epoch of pristine simplicity, however, mattersof even slighter public interest, and of far less intrinsic weight,than the welfare of Hester and her child, were strangely mixedup with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state. Theperiod was hardly, if at all, earlier than that of our story, whena dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not onlycaused a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of thecolony, but resulted in an important modification of the frameworkitself of the legislature.</p><p>Full of concern, therefore,—but so conscious of her own rightthat it seemed scarcely an unequal match between the public,on the one side, and a lonely woman, backed by the sympathies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>of nature, on the other,—Hester Prynne set forth from her solitarycottage. Little Pearl, of course, was her companion. Shewas now of an age to run lightly along by her mother's side,and, constantly in motion, from morn till sunset, could haveaccomplished a much longer journey than that before her. Often,nevertheless, more from caprice than necessity, she demanded tobe taken up in arms; but was soon as imperious to be set downagain, and frisked onward before Hester on the grassy pathway,with many a harmless trip and tumble. We have spoken ofPearl's rich and luxuriant beauty; a beauty that shone with deepand vivid tints; a bright complexion, eyes possessing intensityboth of depth and glow, and hair already of a deep, glossy brown,and which, in after years, would be nearly akin to black. Therewas fire in her and throughout her; she seemed the unpremeditatedoffshoot of a passionate moment. Her mother, in contrivingthe child's garb, had allowed the gorgeous tendencies of herimagination their full play; arraying her in a crimson velvettunic, of a peculiar cut, abundantly embroidered with fantasiesand flourishes of gold-thread. So much strength of coloring,which must have given a wan and pallid aspect to cheeks of afainter bloom, was admirably adapted to Pearl's beauty, and madeher the very brightest little jet of flame that ever danced uponthe earth.</p><p>But it was a remarkable attribute of this garb, and, indeed,of the child's whole appearance, that it irresistibly and inevitablyreminded the beholder of the token which Hester Prynnewas doomed to wear upon her bosom. It was the scarlet letterin another form; the scarlet letter endowed with life! Themother herself—as if the red ignominy were so deeply scorchedinto her brain that all her conceptions assumed its form—had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>carefully wrought out the similitude; lavishing many hours ofmorbid ingenuity, to create an analogy between the object of heraffection and the emblem of her guilt and torture. But, intruth, Pearl was the one, as well as the other; and only in consequenceof that identity had Hester contrived so perfectly torepresent the scarlet letter in her appearance.</p><p>As the two wayfarers came within the precincts of the town,the children of the Puritans looked up from their play,—orwhat passed for play with those sombre little urchins,—andspake gravely one to another:—</p><p>“Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlet letter; and,of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlet letterrunning along by her side! Come, therefore, and let us flingmud at them!”</p><p>But Pearl, who was a dauntless child, after frowning, stampingher foot, and shaking her little hand with a variety of threateninggestures, suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies,and put them all to flight. She resembled, in her fierce pursuitof them, an infant pestilence,—the scarlet fever, or some suchhalf-fledged angel of judgment,—whose mission was to punishthe sins of the rising generation. She screamed and shouted,too, with a terrific volume of sound, which, doubtless, causedthe hearts of the fugitives to quake within them. The victoryaccomplished, Pearl returned quietly to her mother, and lookedup, smiling, into her face.</p><p>Without further adventure, they reached the dwelling of GovernorBellingham. This was a large wooden house, built in afashion of which there are specimens still extant in the streetsof our older towns; now moss-grown, crumbling to decay, andmelancholy at heart with the many sorrowful or joyful occurrences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>remembered or forgotten, that have happened, and passedaway, within their dusky chambers. Then, however, there wasthe freshness of the passing year on its exterior, and the cheerfulness,gleaming forth from the sunny windows, of a humanhabitation, into which death had never entered. It had, indeed,a very cheery aspect; the walls being overspread with a kindof stucco, in which fragments of broken glass were plentifullyintermixed; so that, when the sunshine fell aslant-wise over thefront of the edifice, it glittered and sparkled as if diamondshad been flung against it by the double handful. The brilliancymight have befitted Aladdin's palace, rather than the mansionof a grave old Puritan ruler. It was further decorated withstrange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams, suitableto the quaint taste of the age, which had been drawn in thestucco when newly laid on, and had now grown hard and durable,for the admiration of after times.</p><p>Pearl, looking at this bright wonder of a house, began to caperand dance, and imperatively required that the whole breadthof sunshine should be stripped off its front, and given her toplay with.</p><p>“No, my little Pearl!” said her mother. “Thou must gatherthine own sunshine. I have none to give thee!”</p><p>They approached the door; which was of an arched form,and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projection ofthe edifice, in both of which were lattice-windows, with woodenshutters to close over them at need. Lifting the iron hammerthat hung at the portal, Hester Prynne gave a summons, whichwas answered by one of the Governor's bond-servants; a free-bornEnglishman, but now a seven years' slave. During thatterm he was to be the property of his master, and as much a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>commodity of bargain and sale as an ox, or a joint-stool. Theserf wore the blue coat, which was the customary garb of serving-menof that period, and long before, in the old hereditary hallsof England.</p><p>“Is the worshipful Governor Bellingham within?” inquiredHester.</p><p>“Yea, forsooth,” replied the bond-servant, staring with wide-openeyes at the scarlet letter, which, being a new-comer inthe country, he had never before seen. “Yea, his honorableworship is within. But he hath a godly minister or two withhim, and likewise a leech. Ye may not see his worship now.”</p><p>“Nevertheless, I will enter,” answered Hester Prynne, andthe bond-servant, perhaps judging from the decision of her air,and the glittering symbol in her bosom, that she was a greatlady in the land, offered no opposition.</p><p>So the mother and little Pearl were admitted into the hall ofentrance. With many variations, suggested by the nature of hisbuilding-materials, diversity of climate, and a different mode ofsocial life, Governor Bellingham had planned his new habitationafter the residences of gentlemen of fair estate in his native land.Here, then, was a wide and reasonably lofty hall, extendingthrough the whole depth of the house, and forming a mediumof general communication, more or less directly, with all theother apartments. At one extremity, this spacious room waslighted by the windows of the two towers, which formed a smallrecess on either side of the portal. At the other end, thoughpartly muffled by a curtain, it was more powerfully illuminatedby one of those embowed hall-windows which we read of in oldbooks, and which was provided with a deep and cushioned seat.Here, on the cushion, lay a folio tome, probably of the Chronicles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>of England, or other such substantial literature; even as, in ourown days, we scatter gilded volumes on the centre-table, to beturned over by the casual guest. The furniture of the hall consistedof some ponderous chairs, the backs of which were elaboratelycarved with wreaths of oaken flowers; and likewise a tablein the same taste; the whole being of the Elizabethan age, orperhaps earlier, and heirlooms, transferred hither from the Governor'spaternal home. On the table—in token that the sentimentof old English hospitality had not been left behind—stooda large pewter tankard, at the bottom of which, had Hester orPearl peeped into it, they might have seen the frothy remnantof a recent draught of ale.</p><p>On the wall hung a row of portraits, representing the forefathersof the Bellingham lineage, some with armor on theirbreasts, and others with stately ruffs and robes of peace. Allwere characterized by the sternness and severity which old portraitsso invariably put on; as if they were the ghosts, ratherthan the pictures, of departed worthies, and were gazing withharsh and intolerant criticism at the pursuits and enjoyments ofliving men.</p><p class="figcenter"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25344/25344-h/images/illu_125.jpg"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_125_th.jpg" alt="The Governor&#39;s Breastplate" title="The Governor&#39;s Breastplate"></a></p><p>At about the centre of the oaken panels, that lined the hall,was suspended a suit of mail, not, like the pictures, an ancestralrelic, but of the most modern date; for it had been manufacturedby a skilful armorer in London, the same year in whichGovernor Bellingham came over to New England. There was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>steel head-piece, a cuirass, a gorget, and greaves, with a pair ofgauntlets and a sword hanging beneath; all, and especially thehelmet and breastplate, so highly burnished as to glow withwhite radiance, and scatter an illumination everywhere aboutupon the floor. This bright panoply was not meant for mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>idle show, but had been worn by the Governor on many a solemnmuster and training field, and had glittered, moreover, at thehead of a regiment in the Pequod war. For, though bred alawyer, and accustomed to speak of Bacon, Coke, Noye, andFinch as his professional associates, the exigencies of this newcountry had transformed Governor Bellingham into a soldier, aswell as a statesman and ruler.</p><p>Little Pearl—who was as greatly pleased with the gleamingarmor as she had been with the glittering frontispiece of thehouse—spent some time looking into the polished mirror ofthe breastplate.</p><p>“Mother,” cried she, “I see you here. Look! Look!”</p><p>Hester looked, by way of humoring the child; and she sawthat, owing to the peculiar effect of this convex mirror, thescarlet letter was represented in exaggerated and gigantic proportions,so as to be greatly the most prominent feature of herappearance. In truth, she seemed absolutely hidden behind it.Pearl pointed upward, also, at a similar picture in the head-piece;smiling at her mother, with the elfish intelligence thatwas so familiar an expression on her small physiognomy. Thatlook of naughty merriment was likewise reflected in the mirror,with so much breadth and intensity of effect, that it made HesterPrynne feel as if it could not be the image of her own child,but of an imp who was seeking to mould itself into Pearl'sshape.</p><p>“Come along, Pearl,” said she, drawing her away. “Comeand look into this fair garden. It may be we shall see flowersthere; more beautiful ones than we find in the woods.”</p><p>Pearl, accordingly, ran to the bow-window, at the farther endof the hall, and looked along the vista of a garden-walk, carpeted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>with closely shaven grass, and bordered with some rude andimmature attempt at shrubbery. But the proprietor appearedalready to have relinquished, as hopeless, the effort to perpetuateon this side of the Atlantic, in a hard soil and amid the closestruggle for subsistence, the native English taste for ornamentalgardening. Cabbages grew in plain sight; and a pumpkin-vine,rooted at some distance, had run across the intervening space,and deposited one of its gigantic products directly beneath thehall-window; as if to warn the Governor that this great lumpof vegetable gold was as rich an ornament as New England earthwould offer him. There were a few rose-bushes, however, and anumber of apple-trees, probably the descendants of those plantedby the Reverend Mr. Blackstone, the first settler of the peninsula;that half-mythological personage, who rides through ourearly annals, seated on the back of a bull.</p><p>Pearl, seeing the rose-bushes, began to cry for a red rose,and would not be pacified.</p><p>“Hush, child, hush!” said her mother, earnestly. “Do notcry, dear little Pearl! I hear voices in the garden. The Governoris coming, and gentlemen along with him!”</p><p>In fact, adown the vista of the garden avenue a number ofpersons were seen approaching towards the house. Pearl, in utterscorn of her mother's attempt to quiet her, gave an eldritchscream, and then became silent; not from any notion of obedience,but because the quick and mobile curiosity of her dispositionwas excited by the appearance of these new personages.</p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; padding-top: 4em"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/ornament_iv.jpg" width="400" height="111" alt="" title=""></div><h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII.</h2><h4>THE ELF-CHILD AND THE MINISTER.</h4><div class="initial"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/initial_g.jpg" alt="G" title="G"></div><p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">overnor Bellingham</span>, in a loose gownand easy cap,—such as elderly gentlemenloved to endue themselves with, in theirdomestic privacy,—walked foremost, and appearedto be showing off his estate, andexpatiating on his projected improvements.The wide circumference of an elaborate ruff, beneath his graybeard, in the antiquated fashion of King James's reign, causedhis head to look not a little like that of John the Baptist ina charger. The impression made by his aspect, so rigid andsevere, and frost-bitten with more than autumnal age, was hardlyin keeping with the appliances of worldly enjoyment wherewithhe had evidently done his utmost to surround himself. But itis an error to suppose that our grave forefathers—though accustomedto speak and think of human existence as a state merelyof trial and warfare, and though unfeignedly prepared to sacrificegoods and life at the behest of duty—made it a matterof conscience to reject such means of comfort, or even luxury,as lay fairly within their grasp. This creed was never taught,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>for instance, by the venerable pastor, John Wilson, whose beard,white as a snow-drift, was seen over Governor Bellingham'sshoulder; while its wearer suggested that pears and peachesmight yet be naturalized in the New England climate, and thatpurple grapes might possibly be compelled to nourish, againstthe sunny garden-wall. The old clergyman, nurtured at therich bosom of the English Church, had a long-established andlegitimate taste for all good and comfortable things; and howeverstern he might show himself in the pulpit, or in his public reproofof such transgressions as that of Hester Prynne, still the genialbenevolence of his private life had won him warmer affectionthan was accorded to any of his professional contemporaries.</p><p>Behind the Governor and Mr. Wilson came two other guests:one the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, whom the reader mayremember as having taken a brief and reluctant part in thescene of Hester Prynne's disgrace; and, in close companionshipwith him, old Roger Chillingworth, a person of great skillin physic, who, for two or three years past, had been settledin the town. It was understood that this learned man was thephysician as well as friend of the young minister, whose healthhad severely suffered, of late, by his too unreserved self-sacrificeto the labors and duties of the pastoral relation.</p><p>The Governor, in advance of his visitors, ascended one or twosteps, and, throwing open the leaves of the great hall-window,found himself close to little Pearl. The shadow of the curtainfell on Hester Prynne, and partially concealed her.</p><p>“What have we here?” said Governor Bellingham, lookingwith surprise at the scarlet little figure before him. “I profess,I have never seen the like, since my days of vanity, in oldKing James's time, when I was wont to esteem it a high favor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>to be admitted to a court mask! There used to be a swarmof these small apparitions, in holiday time; and we called themchildren of the Lord of Misrule. But how gat such a guestinto my hall?”</p><p>“Ay, indeed!” cried good old Mr. Wilson. “What littlebird of scarlet plumage may this be? Methinks I have seenjust such figures, when the sun has been shining through a richlypainted window, and tracing out the golden and crimson imagesacross the floor. But that was in the old land. Prithee, youngone, who art thou, and what has ailed thy mother to bedizenthee in this strange fashion? Art thou a Christian child,—ha?Dost know thy catechism? Or art thou one of thosenaughty elfs or fairies, whom we thought to have left behindus, with other relics of Papistry, in merry old England?”</p><p>“I am mother's child,” answered the scarlet vision, “andmy name is Pearl!”</p><p>“Pearl?—Ruby, rather!—or Coral!—or Red Rose, at thevery least, judging from thy hue!” responded the old minister,putting forth his hand in a vain attempt to pat little Pearl onthe cheek. “But where is this mother of thine? Ah! I see,”he added; and, turning to Governor Bellingham, whispered,“This is the selfsame child of whom we have held speech together;and behold here the unhappy woman, Hester Prynne,her mother!”</p><p>“Sayest thou so?” cried the Governor. “Nay, we mighthave judged that such a child's mother must needs be a scarletwoman, and a worthy type of her of Babylon! But she comesat a good time; and we will look into this matter forthwith.”</p><p>Governor Bellingham stepped through the window into thehall, followed by his three guests.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p><p>“Hester Prynne,” said he, fixing his naturally stern regardon the wearer of the scarlet letter, “there hath been much questionconcerning thee, of late. The point hath been weightilydiscussed, whether we, that are of authority and influence, dowell discharge our consciences by trusting an immortal soul,such as there is in yonder child, to the guidance of one whohath stumbled and fallen, amid the pitfalls of this world. Speakthou, the child's own mother! Were it not, thinkest thou, forthy little one's temporal and eternal welfare that she be takenout of thy charge, and clad soberly, and disciplined strictly,and instructed in the truths of heaven and earth? What canstthou do for the child, in this kind?”</p><p>“I can teach my little Pearl what I have learned from this!”answered Hester Prynne, laying her finger on the red token.</p><p>“Woman, it is thy badge of shame!” replied the stern magistrate.“It is because of the stain which that letter indicates,that we would transfer thy child to other hands.”</p><p>“Nevertheless,” said the mother, calmly, though growing morepale, “this badge hath taught me—it daily teaches me—it isteaching me at this moment—lessons whereof my child maybe the wiser and better, albeit they can profit nothing to myself.”</p><p>“We will judge warily,” said Bellingham, “and look wellwhat we are about to do. Good Master Wilson, I pray you,examine this Pearl,—since that is her name,—and see whethershe hath had such Christian nurture as befits a child of her age.”</p><p>The old minister seated himself in an arm-chair, and madean effort to draw Pearl betwixt his knees. But the child, unaccustomedto the touch or familiarity of any but her mother,escaped through the open window, and stood on the upper step,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>looking like a wild tropical bird, of rich plumage, ready to takeflight into the upper air. Mr. Wilson, not a little astonishedat this outbreak,—for he was a grandfatherly sort of personage,and usually a vast favorite with children,—essayed, however,to proceed with the examination.</p><p>“Pearl,” said he, with great solemnity, “thou must take heedto instruction, that so, in due season, thou mayest wear in thybosom the pearl of great price. Canst thou tell me, my child,who made thee?”</p><p>Now Pearl knew well enough who made her; for HesterPrynne, the daughter of a pious home, very soon after her talkwith the child about her Heavenly Father, had begun to informher of those truths which the human spirit, at whatever stage ofimmaturity, imbibes with such eager interest. Pearl, therefore,so large were the attainments of her three years' lifetime, couldhave borne a fair examination in the New England Primer, orthe first column of the Westminster Catechisms, although unacquaintedwith the outward form of either of those celebratedworks. But that perversity which all children have more or lessof, and of which little Pearl had a tenfold portion, now, at themost inopportune moment, took thorough possession of her, andclosed her lips, or impelled her to speak words amiss. Afterputting her finger in her mouth, with many ungracious refusalsto answer good Mr. Wilson's question, the child finally announcedthat she had not been made at all, but had been plucked by hermother off the bush of wild roses that grew by the prison-door.</p><p>This fantasy was probably suggested by the near proximityof the Governor's red roses, as Pearl stood outside of the window;together with her recollection of the prison rose-bush, which shehad passed in coming hither.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p><p>Old Roger Chillingworth, with a smile on his face, whisperedsomething in the young clergyman's ear. Hester Prynne lookedat the man of skill, and even then, with her fate hanging in thebalance, was startled to perceive what a change had come overhis features,—how much uglier they were,—how his dark complexionseemed to have grown duskier, and his figure more misshapen,—sincethe days when she had familiarly known him.She met his eyes for an instant, but was immediately constrainedto give all her attention to the scene now going forward.</p><p>“This is awful!” cried the Governor, slowly recovering fromthe astonishment into which Pearl's response had thrown him.“Here is a child of three years old, and she cannot tell whomade her! Without question, she is equally in the dark as toher soul, its present depravity, and future destiny! Methinks,gentlemen, we need inquire no further.”</p><p>Hester caught hold of Pearl, and drew her forcibly into herarms, confronting the old Puritan magistrate with almost a fierceexpression. Alone in the world, cast off by it, and with thissole treasure to keep her heart alive, she felt that she possessedindefeasible rights against the world, and was ready to defendthem to the death.</p><p>“God gave me the child!” cried she. “He gave her inrequital of all things else, which ye had taken from me. She ismy happiness!—she is my torture, none the less! Pearl keepsme here in life! Pearl punishes me too! See ye not, she isthe scarlet letter, only capable of being loved, and so endowedwith a million-fold the power of retribution for my sin? Yeshall not take her! I will die first!”</p><p class="figcenter"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25344/25344-h/images/illu_135.jpg"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_135_th.jpg" alt="Look thou to it!

Speak for me! Thou knowest,—forthou hast sympathies which these men lack!—thou knowestwhat is in my heart, and what are a mother's rights, and howmuch the stronger they are, when that mother has but her childand the scarlet letter! Look thou to it! I will not lose thechild! Look to it!”</p><p>At this wild and singular appeal, which indicated that HesterPrynne's situation had provoked her to little less than madness,the young minister at once came forward, pale, and holding hishand over his heart, as was his custom whenever his peculiarlynervous temperament was thrown into agitation. He looked nowmore care-worn and emaciated than as we described him at thescene of Hester's public ignominy; and whether it were hisfailing health, or whatever the cause might be, his large darkeyes had a world of pain in their troubled and melancholydepth.</p><p>“There is truth in what she says,” began the minister, witha voice sweet, tremulous, but powerful, insomuch that the hallre-echoed, and the hollow armor rang with it,—“truth in whatHester says, and in the feeling which inspires her! God gaveher the child, and gave her, too, an instinctive knowledge of itsnature and requirements,—both seemingly so peculiar,—whichno other mortal being can possess. And, moreover, is there not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>a quality of awful sacredness in the relation between this motherand this child?”</p><p>“Ay!—how is that, good Master Dimmesdale?” interruptedthe Governor. “Make that plain, I pray you!”</p><p>“It must be even so,” resumed the minister. “For, if wedeem it otherwise, do we not thereby say that the HeavenlyFather, the Creator of all flesh, hath lightly recognized a deed ofsin, and made of no account the distinction between unhallowedlust and holy love? This child of its father's guilt and itsmother's shame hath come from the hand of God, to work inmany ways upon her heart, who pleads so earnestly, and withsuch bitterness of spirit, the right to keep her. It was meantfor a blessing; for the one blessing of her life! It was meant,doubtless, as the mother herself hath told us, for a retributiontoo; a torture to be felt at many an unthought-of moment; apang, a sting, an ever-recurring agony, in the midst of a troubledjoy! Hath she not expressed this thought in the garb of thepoor child, so forcibly reminding us of that red symbol whichsears her bosom?”</p><p>“Well said, again!” cried good Mr. Wilson. “I feared thewoman had no better thought than to make a mountebank ofher child!”</p><p>“O, not so!—not so!” continued Mr. Dimmesdale. “Sherecognizes, believe me, the solemn miracle which God hathwrought, in the existence of that child. And may she feel,too,—what, methinks, is the very truth,—that this boon wasmeant, above all things else, to keep the mother's soul alive,and to preserve her from blacker depths of sin into which Satanmight else have sought to plunge her! Therefore it is good forthis poor, sinful woman that she hath an infant immortality, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>being capable of eternal joy or sorrow, confided to her care,—tobe trained up by her to righteousness,—to remind her, atevery moment, of her fall,—but yet to teach her, as it wereby the Creator's sacred pledge, that, if she bring the child toheaven, the child also will bring its parent thither! Herein isthe sinful mother happier than the sinful father. For HesterPrynne's sake, then, and no less for the poor child's sake, letus leave them as Providence hath seen fit to place them!”</p><p>“You speak, my friend, with a strange earnestness,” said oldRoger Chillingworth, smiling at him.</p><p>“And there is a weighty import in what my young brotherhath spoken,” added the Reverend Mr. Wilson. “What sayyou, worshipful Master Bellingham? Hath he not pleaded wellfor the poor woman?”</p><p>“Indeed hath he,” answered the magistrate, “and hath adducedsuch arguments, that we will even leave the matter as it nowstands; so long, at least, as there shall be no further scandalin the woman. Care must be had, nevertheless, to put the childto due and stated examination in the catechism, at thy handsor Master Dimmesdale's. Moreover, at a proper season, thetithing-men must take heed that she go both to school and tomeeting.”</p><p>The young minister, on ceasing to speak, had withdrawn afew steps from the group, and stood with his face partially concealedin the heavy folds of the window-curtain; while the shadowof his figure, which the sunlight cast upon the floor, was tremulouswith the vehemence of his appeal. Pearl, that wild andflighty little elf, stole softly towards him, and taking his hand inthe grasp of both her own, laid her cheek against it; a caress sotender, and withal so unobtrusive, that her mother, who was looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>on, asked herself,—“Is that my Pearl?” Yet she knew thatthere was love in the child's heart, although it mostly revealeditself in passion, and hardly twice in her lifetime had been softenedby such gentleness as now. The minister,—for, save the long-soughtregards of woman, nothing is sweeter than these marksof childish preference, accorded spontaneously by a spiritualinstinct, and therefore seeming to imply in us something trulyworthy to be loved,—the minister looked round, laid his handon the child's head, hesitated an instant, and then kissed herbrow. Little Pearl's unwonted mood of sentiment lasted nolonger; she laughed, and went capering down the hall, so airily,that old Mr. Wilson raised a question whether even her tiptoestouched the floor.</p><p>“The little baggage hath witchcraft in her, I profess,” saidhe to Mr. Dimmesdale. “She needs no old woman's broomstickto fly withal!”</p><p>“A strange child!” remarked old Roger Chillingworth. “Itis easy to see the mother's part in her. Would it be beyonda philosopher's research, think ye, gentlemen, to analyze thatchild's nature, and, from its make and mould, to give a shrewdguess at the father?”</p><p>“Nay; it would be sinful, in such a question, to follow theclew of profane philosophy,” said Mr. Wilson. “Better to fastand pray upon it; and still better, it may be, to leave the mysteryas we find it, unless Providence reveal it of its own accord.Thereby, every good Christian man hath a title to show a father'skindness towards the poor, deserted babe.”</p><p>The affair being so satisfactorily concluded, Hester Prynne,with Pearl, departed from the house. As they descended thesteps, it is averred that the lattice of a chamber-window was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>thrown open, and forth into the sunny day was thrust the faceof Mistress Hibbins, Governor Bellingham's bitter-tempered sister,and the same who, a few years later, was executed as awitch.</p><p>“Hist, hist!” said she, while her ill-omened physiognomyseemed to cast a shadow over the cheerful newness of the house.“Wilt thou go with us to-night? There will be a merry companyin the forest; and I wellnigh promised the Black Manthat comely Hester Prynne should make one.”</p><p>“Make my excuse to him, so please you!” answered Hester,with a triumphant smile. “I must tarry at home, and keepwatch over my little Pearl. Had they taken her from me, Iwould willingly have gone with thee into the forest, and signedmy name in the Black Man's book too, and that with mine ownblood!”</p><p>“We shall have thee there anon!” said the witch-lady, frowning,as she drew back her head.</p><p>But here—if we suppose this interview betwixt Mistress Hibbinsand Hester Prynne to be authentic, and not a parable—wasalready an illustration of the young minister's argumentagainst sundering the relation of a fallen mother to the offspringof her frailty. Even thus early had the child saved her fromSatan's snare.</p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px; padding-top: 1em"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_141.jpg" width="300" height="98" alt="" title=""></div><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; padding-top: 4em"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/ornament_v.jpg" width="400" height="110" alt="" title=""></div><h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX.</h2><h4>THE LEECH.</h4><div class="initial"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/initial_u.jpg" alt="U" title="U"></div><p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">nder</span> the appellation of Roger Chillingworth,the reader will remember, was hidden anothername, which its former wearer had resolvedshould never more be spoken. It has beenrelated, how, in the crowd that witnessedHester Prynne's ignominious exposure, stooda man, elderly, travel-worn, who, just emerging from the perilouswilderness, beheld the woman, in whom he hoped to find embodiedthe warmth and cheerfulness of home, set up as a type of sinbefore the people. Her matronly fame was trodden under allmen's feet. Infamy was babbling around her in the publicmarket-place. For her kindred, should the tidings ever reachthem, and for the companions of her unspotted life, there remainednothing but the contagion of her dishonor; which would notfail to be distributed in strict accordance and proportion withthe intimacy and sacredness of their previous relationship. Thenwhy—since the choice was with himself—should the individual,whose connection with the fallen woman had been the mostintimate and sacred of them all, come forward to vindicate his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>claim to an inheritance so little desirable? He resolved not tobe pilloried beside her on her pedestal of shame. Unknown toall but Hester Prynne, and possessing the lock and key of hersilence, he chose to withdraw his name from the roll of mankind,and, as regarded his former ties and interests, to vanish out oflife as completely as if he indeed lay at the bottom of the ocean,whither rumor had long ago consigned him. This purpose onceeffected, new interests would immediately spring up, and likewisea new purpose; dark, it is true, if not guilty, but of forceenough to engage the full strength of his faculties.</p><p>In pursuance of this resolve, he took up his residence in thePuritan town, as Roger Chillingworth, without other introductionthan the learning and intelligence of which he possessed morethan a common measure. As his studies, at a previous periodof his life, had made him extensively acquainted with the medicalscience of the day, it was as a physician that he presented himself,and as such was cordially received. Skilful men, of themedical and chirurgical profession, were of rare occurrence in thecolony. They seldom, it would appear, partook of the religiouszeal that brought other emigrants across the Atlantic. In theirresearches into the human frame, it may be that the higher andmore subtile faculties of such men were materialized, and thatthey lost the spiritual view of existence amid the intricacies ofthat wondrous mechanism, which seemed to involve art enoughto comprise all of life within itself. At all events, the health ofthe good town of Boston, so far as medicine had aught to dowith it, had hitherto lain in the guardianship of an aged deaconand apothecary, whose piety and godly deportment were strongertestimonials in his favor than any that he could have producedin the shape of a diploma. The only surgeon was one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>combined the occasional exercise of that noble art with the dailyand habitual flourish of a razor. To such a professional bodyRoger Chillingworth was a brilliant acquisition. He soon manifestedhis familiarity with the ponderous and imposing machineryof antique physic; in which every remedy contained a multitudeof far-fetched and heterogeneous ingredients, as elaborately compoundedas if the proposed result had been the Elixir of Life.In his Indian captivity, moreover, he had gained much knowledgeof the properties of native herbs and roots; nor did heconceal from his patients, that these simple medicines, Nature'sboon to the untutored savage, had quite as large a share of hisown confidence as the European pharmacopœia, which so manylearned doctors had spent centuries in elaborating.</p><p>This learned stranger was exemplary, as regarded, at least,the outward forms of a religious life, and, early after his arrival,had chosen for his spiritual guide the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale.The young divine, whose scholar-like renown still lived in Oxford,was considered by his more fervent admirers as little less thana heaven-ordained apostle, destined, should he live and labor forthe ordinary term of life, to do as great deeds for the nowfeeble New England Church, as the early Fathers had achievedfor the infancy of the Christian faith. About this period, however,the health of Mr. Dimmesdale had evidently begun to fail.By those best acquainted with his habits, the paleness of theyoung minister's cheek was accounted for by his too earnest devotionto study, his scrupulous fulfilment of parochial duty, and,more than all, by the fasts and vigils of which he made a frequentpractice, in order to keep the grossness of this earthlystate from clogging and obscuring his spiritual lamp. Somedeclared, that, if Mr. Dimmesdale were really going to die, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>was cause enough, that the world was not worthy to be anylonger trodden by his feet. He himself, on the other hand,with characteristic humility, avowed his belief, that, if Providenceshould see fit to remove him, it would be because of hisown unworthiness to perform its humblest mission here on earth.With all this difference of opinion as to the cause of his decline,there could be no question of the fact. His form grew emaciated;his voice, though still rich and sweet, had a certain melancholyprophecy of decay in it; he was often observed, on any slightalarm or other sudden accident, to put his hand over his heart,with first a flush and then a paleness, indicative of pain.</p><p>Such was the young clergyman's condition, and so imminentthe prospect that his dawning light would be extinguished, alluntimely, when Roger Chillingworth made his advent to the town.His first entry on the scene, few people could tell whence, droppingdown, as it were, out of the sky, or starting from the netherearth, had an aspect of mystery, which was easily heightened tothe miraculous. He was now known to be a man of skill; itwas observed that he gathered herbs, and the blossoms of wild-flowers,and dug up roots, and plucked off twigs from the forest-trees,like one acquainted with hidden virtues in what wasvalueless to common eyes. He was heard to speak of SirKenelm Digby, and other famous men,—whose scientific attainmentswere esteemed hardly less than supernatural,—as havingbeen his correspondents or associates. Why, with such rank inthe learned world, had he come hither? What could he, whosesphere was in great cities, be seeking in the wilderness? Inanswer to this query, a rumor gained ground,—and, howeverabsurd, was entertained by some very sensible people,—thatHeaven had wrought an absolute miracle, by transporting an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>eminent Doctor of Physic, from a German university, bodilythrough the air, and setting him down at the door of Mr. Dimmesdale'sstudy! Individuals of wiser faith, indeed, who knew thatHeaven promotes its purposes without aiming at the stage-effectof what is called miraculous interposition, were inclined tosee a providential hand in Roger Chillingworth's so opportunearrival.</p><p>This idea was countenanced by the strong interest which thephysician ever manifested in the young clergyman; he attachedhimself to him as a parishioner, and sought to win a friendlyregard and confidence from his naturally reserved sensibility. Heexpressed great alarm at his pastor's state of health, but wasanxious to attempt the cure, and, if early undertaken, seemednot despondent of a favorable result. The elders, the deacons,the motherly dames, and the young and fair maidens, of Mr.Dimmesdale's flock, were alike importunate that he should maketrial of the physician's frankly offered skill. Mr. Dimmesdalegently repelled their entreaties.</p><p>“I need no medicine,” said he.</p><p>But how could the young minister say so, when, with everysuccessive Sabbath, his cheek was paler and thinner, and hisvoice more tremulous than before,—when it had now become aconstant habit, rather than a casual gesture, to press his handover his heart? Was he weary of his labors? Did he wish todie? These questions were solemnly propounded to Mr. Dimmesdaleby the elder ministers of Boston and the deacons of hischurch, who, to use their own phrase, “dealt with him” on thesin of rejecting the aid which Providence so manifestly held out.He listened in silence, and finally promised to confer with thephysician.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p><p>“Were it God's will,” said the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale,when, in fulfilment of this pledge, he requested old Roger Chillingworth'sprofessional advice, “I could be well content, thatmy labors, and my sorrows, and my sins, and my pains, shouldshortly end with me, and what is earthly of them be buried inmy grave, and the spiritual go with me to my eternal state,rather than that you should put your skill to the proof in mybehalf.”</p><p>“Ah,” replied Roger Chillingworth, with that quietness which,whether imposed or natural, marked all his deportment, “it isthus that a young clergyman is apt to speak. Youthful men,not having taken a deep root, give up their hold of life so easily!And saintly men, who walk with God on earth, would fain beaway, to walk with him on the golden pavements of the NewJerusalem.”</p><p>“Nay,” rejoined the young minister, putting his hand to hisheart, with a flush of pain flitting over his brow, “were I worthierto walk there, I could be better content to toil here.”</p><p>“Good men ever interpret themselves too meanly,” said thephysician.</p><p class="figcenter"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25344/25344-h/images/illu_148.jpg"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_148_th.jpg" alt="The Minister and Leech" title="The Minister and Leech"></a></p><p>In this manner, the mysterious old Roger Chillingworth becamethe medical adviser of the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. As notonly the disease interested the physician, but he was strongly movedto look into the character and qualities of the patient, these twomen, so different in age, came gradually to spend much timetogether. For the sake of the minister's health, and to enablethe leech to gather plants with healing balm in them, they tooklong walks on the sea-shore, or in the forest; mingling varioustalk with the plash and murmur of the waves, and the solemnwind-anthem among the tree-tops. Often, likewise, one was theguest of the other, in his place of study and retirement. Therewas a fascination for the minister in the company of the manof science, in whom he recognized an intellectual cultivationof no moderate depth or scope; together with a range and freedomof ideas, that he would have vainly looked for among themembers of his own profession. In truth, he was startled, if notshocked, to find this attribute in the physician. Mr. Dimmesdalewas a true priest, a true religionist, with the reverential sentimentlargely developed, and an order of mind that impelled itselfpowerfully along the track of a creed, and wore its passage continuallydeeper with the lapse of time. In no state of societywould he have been what is called a man of liberal views; itwould always be essential to his peace to feel the pressure of afaith about him, supporting, while it confined him within its iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>framework. Not the less, however, though with a tremulousenjoyment, did he feel the occasional relief of looking at theuniverse through the medium of another kind of intellect thanthose with which he habitually held converse. It was as if awindow were thrown open, admitting a freer atmosphere intothe close and stifled study, where his life was wasting itself away,amid lamplight, or obstructed day-beams, and the musty fragrance,be it sensual or moral, that exhales from books. But the airwas too fresh and chill to be long breathed with comfort. Sothe minister, and the physician with him, withdrew again withinthe limits of what their church defined as orthodox.</p><p>Thus Roger Chillingworth scrutinized his patient carefully, bothas he saw him in his ordinary life, keeping an accustomed pathwayin the range of thoughts familiar to him, and as he appearedwhen thrown amidst other moral scenery, the novelty of whichmight call out something new to the surface of his character.He deemed it essential, it would seem, to know the man, beforeattempting to do him good. Wherever there is a heart and anintellect, the diseases of the physical frame are tinged with thepeculiarities of these. In Arthur Dimmesdale, thought andimagination were so active, and sensibility so intense, that thebodily infirmity would be likely to have its groundwork there.So Roger Chillingworth—the man of skill, the kind and friendlyphysician—strove to go deep into his patient's bosom, delvingamong his principles, prying into his recollections, and probingeverything with a cautious touch, like a treasure-seeker in adark cavern. Few secrets can escape an investigator, who hasopportunity and license to undertake such a quest, and skill tofollow it up. A man burdened with a secret should especiallyavoid the intimacy of his physician. If the latter possess native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>sagacity, and a nameless something more,—let us call it intuition;if he show no intrusive egotism, nor disagreeably prominentcharacteristics of his own; if he have the power, which mustbe born with him, to bring his mind into such affinity with hispatient's, that this last shall unawares have spoken what heimagines himself only to have thought; if such revelationsbe received without tumult, and acknowledged not so often byan uttered sympathy as by silence, an inarticulate breath, andhere and there a word, to indicate that all is understood; if tothese qualifications of a confidant be joined the advantages affordedby his recognized character as a physician;—then, at some inevitablemoment, will the soul of the sufferer be dissolved, and flowforth in a dark, but transparent stream, bringing all its mysteriesinto the daylight.</p><p>Roger Chillingworth possessed all, or most, of the attributesabove enumerated. Nevertheless, time went on; a kind of intimacy,as we have said, grew up between these two cultivatedminds, which had as wide a field as the whole sphere of humanthought and study, to meet upon; they discussed every topicof ethics and religion, of public affairs and private character;they talked much, on both sides, of matters that seemed personalto themselves; and yet no secret, such as the physician fanciedmust exist there, ever stole out of the minister's consciousnessinto his companion's ear. The latter had his suspicions, indeed,that even the nature of Mr. Dimmesdale's bodily disease hadnever fairly been revealed to him. It was a strange reserve!</p><p>After a time, at a hint from Roger Chillingworth, the friendsof Mr. Dimmesdale effected an arrangement by which the twowere lodged in the same house; so that every ebb and flow ofthe minister's life-tide might pass under the eye of his anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>and attached physician. There was much joy throughout thetown, when this greatly desirable object was attained. It washeld to be the best possible measure for the young clergyman'swelfare; unless, indeed, as often urged by such as felt authorizedto do so, he had selected some one of the many blooming damsels,spiritually devoted to him, to become his devoted wife.This latter step, however, there was no present prospect thatArthur Dimmesdale would be prevailed upon to take; he rejectedall suggestions of the kind, as if priestly celibacy were one of hisarticles of church-discipline. Doomed by his own choice, therefore,as Mr. Dimmesdale so evidently was, to eat his unsavorymorsel always at another's board, and endure the life-long chillwhich must be his lot who seeks to warm himself only at another'sfireside, it truly seemed that this sagacious, experienced, benevolentold physician, with his concord of paternal and reverentiallove for the young pastor, was the very man, of all mankind,to be constantly within reach of his voice.</p><p>The new abode of the two friends was with a pious widow,of good social rank, who dwelt in a house covering pretty nearlythe site on which the venerable structure of King's Chapel hassince been built. It had the graveyard, originally Isaac Johnson'shome-field, on one side, and so was well adapted to callup serious reflections, suited to their respective employments, inboth minister and man of physic. The motherly care of thegood widow assigned to Mr. Dimmesdale a front apartment, witha sunny exposure, and heavy window-curtains, to create a noontideshadow, when desirable. The walls were hung round withtapestry, said to be from the Gobelin looms, and, at all events,representing the Scriptural story of David and Bathsheba, andNathan the Prophet, in colors still unfaded, but which made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>fair woman of the scene almost as grimly picturesque as the woe-denouncingseer. Here the pale clergyman piled up his library,rich with parchment-bound folios of the Fathers, and the loreof Rabbis, and monkish erudition, of which the Protestant divines,even while they vilified and decried that class of writers, were yetconstrained often to avail themselves. On the other side of thehouse old Roger Chillingworth arranged his study and laboratory;not such as a modern man of science would reckon eventolerably complete, but provided with a distilling apparatus, andthe means of compounding drugs and chemicals, which the practisedalchemist knew well how to turn to purpose. With suchcommodiousness of situation, these two learned persons sat themselvesdown, each in his own domain, yet familiarly passing fromone apartment to the other, and bestowing a mutual and notincurious inspection into one another's business.</p><p>And the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale's best discerning friends,as we have intimated, very reasonably imagined that the handof Providence had done all this, for the purpose—besought inso many public, and domestic, and secret prayers—of restoringthe young minister to health. But—it must now be said—anotherportion of the community had latterly begun to take itsown view of the relation betwixt Mr. Dimmesdale and the mysteriousold physician. When an uninstructed multitude attemptsto see with its eyes, it is exceedingly apt to be deceived. When,however, it forms its judgment, as it usually does, on the intuitionsof its great and warm heart, the conclusions thus attainedare often so profound and so unerring, as to possess the characterof truths supernaturally revealed. The people, in the caseof which we speak, could justify its prejudice against Roger Chillingworthby no fact or argument worthy of serious refutation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>There was an aged handicraftsman, it is true, who had been acitizen of London at the period of Sir Thomas Overbury's murder,now some thirty years agone; he testified to having seenthe physician, under some other name, which the narrator ofthe story had now forgotten, in company with Doctor Forman, thefamous old conjurer, who was implicated in the affair of Overbury.Two or three individuals hinted, that the man of skill,during his Indian captivity, had enlarged his medical attainmentsby joining in the incantations of the savage priests; who wereuniversally acknowledged to be powerful enchanters, often performingseemingly miraculous cures by their skill in the blackart. A large number—and many of these were persons of suchsober sense and practical observation that their opinions wouldhave been valuable, in other matters—affirmed that Roger Chillingworth'saspect had undergone a remarkable change while hehad dwelt in town, and especially since his abode with Mr.Dimmesdale. At first, his expression had been calm, meditative,scholar-like. Now, there was something ugly and evil in hisface, which they had not previously noticed, and which grewstill the more obvious to sight, the oftener they looked uponhim. According to the vulgar idea, the fire in his laboratoryhad been brought from the lower regions, and was fed withinfernal fuel; and so, as might be expected, his visage was gettingsooty with the smoke.</p><p>To sum up the matter, it grew to be a widely diffused opinion,that the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, like many other personagesof especial sanctity, in all ages of the Christian world, washaunted either by Satan himself, or Satan's emissary, in theguise of old Roger Chillingworth. This diabolical agent had theDivine permission, for a season, to burrow into the clergyman's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>intimacy, and plot against his soul. No sensible man, it wasconfessed, could doubt on which side the victory would turn.The people looked, with an unshaken hope, to see the ministercome forth out of the conflict, transfigured with the glory whichhe would unquestionably win. Meanwhile, nevertheless, it wassad to think of the perchance mortal agony through which hemust struggle towards his triumph.</p><p>Alas! to judge from the gloom and terror in the depths ofthe poor minister's eyes, the battle was a sore one and the victoryanything but secure.</p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px; padding-top: 1em"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_79.jpg" width="300" height="222" alt="" title=""></div><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; padding-top: 4em"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/ornament_iii.jpg" width="400" height="111" alt="" title=""></div><h2><a name="X" id="X"></a>X.</h2><h4>THE LEECH AND HIS PATIENT.</h4><div class="initial"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/initial_o.jpg" alt="O" title="O"></div><p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">ld</span> Roger Chillingworth, throughout life, hadbeen calm in temperament, kindly, thoughnot of warm affections, but ever, and in allhis relations with the world, a pure andupright man. He had begun an investigation,as he imagined, with the severe andequal integrity of a judge, desirous only of truth, even as if thequestion involved no more than the air-drawn lines and figuresof a geometrical problem, instead of human passions, and wrongsinflicted on himself. But, as he proceeded, a terrible fascination,a kind of fierce, though still calm, necessity, seized the old manwithin its gripe, and never set him free again, until he had doneall its bidding. He now dug into the poor clergyman's heart,like a miner searching for gold; or, rather, like a sexton delvinginto a grave, possibly in quest of a jewel that had been buriedon the dead man's bosom, but likely to find nothing save mortalityand corruption. Alas for his own soul, if these werewhat he sought!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p><p>Sometimes, a light glimmered out of the physician's eyes,burning blue and ominous, like the reflection of a furnace, or,let us say, like one of those gleams of ghastly fire that dartedfrom Bunyan's awful doorway in the hillside, and quivered onthe pilgrim's face. The soil where this dark miner was workinghad perchance shown indications that encouraged him.</p><p>“This man,” said he, at one such moment, to himself, “pureas they deem him,—all spiritual as he seems,—hath inheriteda strong animal nature from his father or his mother. Let usdig a little further in the direction of this vein!”</p><p>Then, after long search into the minister's dim interior, andturning over many precious materials, in the shape of high aspirationsfor the welfare of his race, warm love of souls, pure sentiments,natural piety, strengthened by thought and study, andilluminated by revelation,—all of which invaluable gold wasperhaps no better than rubbish to the seeker,—he would turnback, discouraged, and begin his quest towards another point.He groped along as stealthily, with as cautious a tread, and aswary an outlook, as a thief entering a chamber where a manlies only half asleep,—or, it may be, broad awake,—with purposeto steal the very treasure which this man guards as the appleof his eye. In spite of his premeditated carefulness, the floorwould now and then creak; his garments would rustle; theshadow of his presence, in a forbidden proximity, would be thrownacross his victim. In other words, Mr. Dimmesdale, whose sensibilityof nerve often produced the effect of spiritual intuition,would become vaguely aware that something inimical to hispeace had thrust itself into relation with him. But old RogerChillingworth, too, had perceptions that were almost intuitive;and when the minister threw his startled eyes towards him, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>the physician sat; his kind, watchful, sympathizing, but neverintrusive friend.</p><p>Yet Mr. Dimmesdale would perhaps have seen this individual'scharacter more perfectly, if a certain morbidness, to which, sickhearts are liable, had not rendered him suspicious of all mankind.Trusting no man as his friend, he could not recognizehis enemy when the latter actually appeared. He therefore stillkept up a familiar intercourse with him, daily receiving the oldphysician in his study; or visiting the laboratory, and, for recreation'ssake, watching the processes by which weeds were convertedinto drugs of potency.</p><p>One day, leaning his forehead on his hand, and his elbow onthe sill of the open window, that looked towards the graveyard,he talked with Roger Chillingworth, while the old man wasexamining a bundle of unsightly plants.</p><p>“Where,” asked he, with a look askance at them,—for itwas the clergyman's peculiarity that he seldom, nowadays, lookedstraightforth at any object, whether human or inanimate,—“where,my kind doctor, did you gather those herbs, with sucha dark, flabby leaf?”</p><p>“Even in the graveyard here at hand,” answered the physician,continuing his employment. “They are new to me. Ifound them growing on a grave, which bore no tombstone, norother memorial of the dead man, save these ugly weeds, thathave taken upon themselves to keep him in remembrance. Theygrew out of his heart, and typify, it may be, some hideous secretthat was buried with him, and which he had done better toconfess during his lifetime.”</p><p>“Perchance,” said Mr. Dimmesdale, “he earnestly desired it,but could not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>”</p><p>“And wherefore?” rejoined the physician. “Wherefore not;since all the powers of nature call so earnestly for the confessionof sin, that these black weeds have sprung up out of aburied heart, to make manifest an unspoken crime?”</p><p>“That, good Sir, is but a fantasy of yours,” replied the minister.“There can be, if I forebode aright, no power, short ofthe Divine mercy, to disclose, whether by uttered words, or bytype or emblem, the secrets that may be buried with a humanheart. The heart, making itself guilty of such secrets, mustperforce hold them, until the day when all hidden things shallbe revealed. Nor have I so read or interpreted Holy Writ, asto understand that the disclosure of human thoughts and deeds,then to be made, is intended as a part of the retribution. That,surely, were a shallow view of it. No; these revelations, unlessI greatly err, are meant merely to promote the intellectual satisfactionof all intelligent beings, who will stand waiting, on thatday, to see the dark problem of this life made plain. A knowledgeof men's hearts will be needful to the completest solutionof that problem. And I conceive, moreover, that the heartsholding such miserable secrets as you speak of will yield themup, at that last day, not with reluctance, but with a joy unutterable.”</p><p>“Then why not reveal them here?” asked Roger Chillingworth,glancing quietly aside at the minister. “Why shouldnot the guilty ones sooner avail themselves of this unutterablesolace?”</p><p>“They mostly do,” said the clergyman, griping hard at hisbreast as if afflicted with an importunate throb of pain. “Many,many a poor soul hath given its confidence to me, not only onthe death-bed, but while strong in life, and fair in reputation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>And ever, after such an outpouring, O, what a relief have Iwitnessed in those sinful brethren! even as in one who at lastdraws free air, after long stifling with his own polluted breath.How can it be otherwise? Why should a wretched man, guilty,we will say, of murder, prefer to keep the dead corpse buriedin his own heart, rather than fling it forth at once, and let theuniverse take care of it!”</p><p>“Yet some men bury their secrets thus,” observed the calmphysician.</p><p>“True; there are such men,” answered Mr. Dimmesdale.“But, not to suggest more obvious reasons, it may be that theyare kept silent by the very constitution of their nature. Or,—canwe not suppose it?—guilty as they may be, retaining,nevertheless, a zeal for God's glory and man's welfare, theyshrink from displaying themselves black and filthy in the viewof men; because, thenceforward, no good can be achieved bythem; no evil of the past be redeemed by better service. So, totheir own unutterable torment, they go about among their fellow-creatures,looking pure as new-fallen snow while their heartsare all speckled and spotted with iniquity of which they cannotrid themselves.”</p><p>“These men deceive themselves,” said Roger Chillingworth,with somewhat more emphasis than usual, and making a slightgesture with his forefinger. “They fear to take up the shamethat rightfully belongs to them. Their love for man, their zealfor God's service,—these holy impulses may or may not coexistin their hearts with the evil inmates to which their guilt hasunbarred the door, and which must needs propagate a hellishbreed within them. But, if they seek to glorify God, let themnot lift heavenward their unclean hands! If they would serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>their fellow-men, let them do it by making manifest the powerand reality of conscience, in constraining them to penitentialself-abasement! Wouldst thou have me to believe, O wise andpious friend, that a false show can be better—can be morefor God's glory, or man's welfare—than God's own truth?Trust me, such men deceive themselves!”</p><p>“It may be so,” said the young clergyman, indifferently, aswaiving a discussion that he considered irrelevant or unseasonable.He had a ready faculty, indeed, of escaping from anytopic that agitated his too sensitive and nervous temperament.—“But,now, I would ask of my well-skilled physician, whether,in good sooth, he deems me to have profited by his kindly careof this weak frame of mine?”</p><p>Before Roger Chillingworth could answer, they heard the clear,wild laughter of a young child's voice, proceeding from the adjacentburial-ground. Looking instinctively from the open window,—forit was summer-time,—the minister beheld HesterPrynne and little Pearl passing along the footpath that traversedthe enclosure. Pearl looked as beautiful as the day, but wasin one of those moods of perverse merriment which, wheneverthey occurred, seemed to remove her entirely out of the sphereof sympathy or human contact. She now skipped irreverentlyfrom one grave to another; until, coming to the broad, flat,armorial tombstone of a departed worthy,—perhaps of IsaacJohnson himself,—she began to dance upon it. In reply toher mother's command and entreaty that she would behave moredecorously, little Pearl paused to gather the prickly burrs froma tall burdock which grew beside the tomb. Taking a handfulof these, she arranged them along the lines of the scarlet letterthat decorated the maternal bosom, to which the burrs, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>their nature was, tenaciously adhered. Hester did not pluckthem off.</p><p>Roger Chillingworth had by this time approached the window,and smiled grimly down.</p><p>“There is no law, nor reverence for authority, no regard forhuman ordinances or opinions, right or wrong, mixed up withthat child's composition,” remarked he, as much to himself asto his companion. “I saw her, the other day, bespatter theGovernor himself with water, at the cattle-trough in SpringLane. What, in Heaven's name, is she? Is the imp altogetherevil? Hath she affections? Hath she any discoverableprinciple of being?”</p><p>“None, save the freedom of a broken law,” answered Mr.Dimmesdale, in a quiet way, as if he had been discussing thepoint within himself. “Whether capable of good, I knownot.”</p><p>The child probably overheard their voices; for, looking upto the window, with a bright, but naughty smile of mirth andintelligence, she threw one of the prickly burrs at the ReverendMr. Dimmesdale. The sensitive clergyman shrunk, with nervousdread, from the light missile. Detecting his emotion, Pearlclapped her little hands, in the most extravagant ecstasy. HesterPrynne, likewise, had involuntarily looked up; and all these fourpersons, old and young, regarded one another in silence, tillthe child laughed aloud, and shouted,—“Come away, mother!Come away, or yonder old Black Man will catch you! He hathgot hold of the minister already. Come away, mother, or hewill catch you! But he cannot catch little Pearl!”</p><p>So she drew her mother away, skipping, dancing, and friskingfantastically, among the hillocks of the dead people, like a creature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>that had nothing in common with a bygone and buriedgeneration, nor owned herself akin to it. It was as if she hadbeen made afresh, out of new elements, and must perforce bepermitted to live her own life, and be a law unto herself, withouther eccentricities being reckoned to her for a crime.</p><p>“There goes a woman,” resumed Roger Chillingworth, aftera pause, “who, be her demerits what they may, hath none ofthat mystery of hidden sinfulness which you deem so grievousto be borne. Is Hester Prynne the less miserable, think you,for that scarlet letter on her breast?”</p><p>“I do verily believe it,” answered the clergyman. “Nevertheless,I cannot answer for her. There was a look of pain inher face, which I would gladly have been spared the sight of.But still, methinks, it must needs be better for the sufferer tobe free to show his pain, as this poor woman Hester is, thanto cover it all up in his heart.”</p><p>There was another pause; and the physician began anew toexamine and arrange the plants which he had gathered.</p><p>“You inquired of me, a little time agone,” said he, at length,“my judgment as touching your health.”</p><p>“I did,” answered the clergyman, “and would gladly learnit. Speak frankly, I pray you, be it for life or death.”</p><p>“Freely, then, and plainly,” said the physician, still busywith his plants, but keeping a wary eye on Mr. Dimmesdale,“the disorder is a strange one; not so much in itself, nor asoutwardly manifested,—in so far, at least, as the symptomshave been laid open to my observation. Looking daily at you,my good Sir, and watching the tokens of your aspect, now formonths gone by, I should deem you a man sore sick, it may be,yet not so sick but that an instructed and watchful physician<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>might well hope to cure you. But—I know not what to say—thedisease is what I seem to know, yet know it not.”</p><p>“You speak in riddles, learned Sir,” said the pale minister,glancing aside out of the window.</p><p>“Then, to speak more plainly,” continued the physician, “andI crave pardon, Sir,—should it seem to require pardon,—forthis needful plainness of my speech. Let me ask,—as yourfriend,—as one having charge, under Providence, of your lifeand physical well-being,—hath all the operation of this disorderbeen fairly laid open and recounted to me?”</p><p>“How can you question it?” asked the minister. “Surely,it were child's play, to call in a physician, and then hide thesore!”</p><p>“You would tell me, then, that I know all?” said Roger Chillingworth,deliberately, and fixing an eye, bright with intenseand concentrated intelligence, on the minister's face. “Be it so!But, again! He to whom only the outward and physical evilis laid open, knoweth, oftentimes, but half the evil which he iscalled upon to cure. A bodily disease, which we look upon aswhole and entire within itself, may, after all, be but a symptomof some ailment in the spiritual part. Your pardon, once again,good Sir, if my speech give the shadow of offence. You, Sir,of all men whom I have known, are he whose body is the closestconjoined, and imbued, and identified, so to speak, with the spiritwhereof it is the instrument.”</p><p>“Then I need ask no further,” said the clergyman, somewhathastily rising from his chair. “You deal not, I take it, in medicinefor the soul!”</p><p>“Thus, a sickness,” continued Roger Chillingworth, going on,in an unaltered tone, without heeding the interruption,—but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>standing up, and confronting the emaciated and white-cheekedminister, with his low, dark, and misshapen figure,—“a sickness,a sore place, if we may so call it, in your spirit, hath immediatelyits appropriate manifestation in your bodily frame. Wouldyou, therefore, that your physician heal the bodily evil? Howmay this be, unless you first lay open to him the wound or troublein your soul?”</p><p>“No!—not to thee!—not to an earthly physician!” criedMr. Dimmesdale, passionately, and turning his eyes, full andbright, and with a kind of fierceness, on old Roger Chillingworth.“Not to thee! But if it be the soul's disease, thendo I commit myself to the one Physician of the soul! He,if it stand with his good pleasure, can cure; or he can kill!Let him do with me as, in his justice and wisdom, heshall see good. But who art thou, that meddlest in this matter?—thatdares thrust himself between the sufferer and hisGod?”</p><p>With a frantic gesture he rushed out of the room.</p><p>“It is as well to have made this step,” said Roger Chillingworthto himself, looking after the minister with a grave smile.“There is nothing lost. We shall be friends again anon. Butsee, now, how passion takes hold upon this man, and hurriethhim out of himself! As with one passion, so with another!He hath done a wild thing erenow, this pious Master Dimmesdale,in the hot passion of his heart!”</p><p class="figcenter"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25344/25344-h/images/illu_165.jpg"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_165_th.jpg" alt="The Leech and his Patient" title="The Leech and his Patient"></a></p><p>It proved not difficult to re-establish the intimacy of the twocompanions, on the same footing and in the same degree asheretofore. The young clergyman, after a few hours of privacy,was sensible that the disorder of his nerves had hurried himinto an unseemly outbreak of temper, which there had beennothing in the physician's words to excuse or palliate. Hemarvelled, indeed, at the violence with which he had thrustback the kind old man, when merely proffering the advicewhich it was his duty to bestow, and which the minister himselfhad expressly sought. With these remorseful feelings, helost no time in making the amplest apologies, and besought hisfriend still to continue the care, which, if not successful inrestoring him to health, had, in all probability, been the meansof prolonging his feeble existence to that hour. Roger Chillingworthreadily assented, and went on with his medical supervisionof the minister; doing his best for him, in all goodfaith, but always quitting the patient's apartment, at the closeof a professional interview, with a mysterious and puzzled smileupon his lips. This expression was invisible in Mr. Dimmesdale's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>presence, but grew strongly evident as the physiciancrossed the threshold.</p><p>“A rare case!” he muttered. “I must needs look deeperinto it. A strange sympathy betwixt soul and body! Wereit only for the art's sake, I must search this matter to thebottom!”</p><p>It came to pass, not long after the scene above recorded,that the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, at noonday, and entirelyunawares, fell into a deep, deep slumber, sitting in his chair,with a large black-letter volume open before him on the table.It must have been a work of vast ability in the somniferousschool of literature. The profound depth of the minister'srepose was the more remarkable, inasmuch as he was one ofthose persons whose sleep, ordinarily, is as light, as fitful, andas easily scared away, as a small bird hopping on a twig. Tosuch an unwonted remoteness, however, had his spirit now withdrawninto itself, that he stirred not in his chair, when oldRoger Chillingworth, without any extraordinary precaution, cameinto the room. The physician advanced directly in front ofhis patient, laid his hand upon his bosom, and thrust asidethe vestment, that, hitherto, had always covered it even fromthe professional eye.</p><p>Then, indeed, Mr. Dimmesdale shuddered, and slightly stirred.</p><p>After a brief pause, the physician turned away.</p><p>But, with what a wild look of wonder, joy, and horror! Withwhat a ghastly rapture, as it were, too mighty to be expressedonly by the eye and features, and therefore bursting forth throughthe whole ugliness of his figure, and making itself even riotouslymanifest by the extravagant gestures with which he threw up hisarms towards the ceiling, and stamped his foot upon the floor!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>Had a man seen old Roger Chillingworth, at that moment of hisecstasy, he would have had no need to ask how Satan comportshimself, when a precious human soul is lost to heaven, and woninto his kingdom.</p><p>But what distinguished the physician's ecstasy from Satan'swas the trait of wonder in it!</p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px; padding-top: 1em"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_053.jpg" width="300" height="217" alt="" title=""></div><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; padding-top: 4em"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/ornament_vii.jpg" width="400" height="109" alt="" title=""></div><h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI.</h2><h4>THE INTERIOR OF A HEART.</h4><div class="initial"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/initial_a.jpg" alt="A" title="A"></div><p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">fter</span> the incident last described, the intercoursebetween the clergyman and the physician,though externally the same, was reallyof another character than it had previouslybeen. The intellect of Roger Chillingworthhad now a sufficiently plain path before it.It was not, indeed, precisely that which he had laid out for himselfto tread. Calm, gentle, passionless, as he appeared, therewas yet, we fear, a quiet depth of malice, hitherto latent, butactive now, in this unfortunate old man, which led him to imaginea more intimate revenge than any mortal had ever wreaked uponan enemy. To make himself the one trusted friend, to whomshould be confided all the fear, the remorse, the agony, the ineffectualrepentance, the backward rush of sinful thoughts, expelledin vain! All that guilty sorrow, hidden from the world, whosegreat heart would have pitied and forgiven, to be revealed to him,the Pitiless, to him, the Unforgiving! All that dark treasureto be lavished on the very man, to whom nothing else could soadequately pay the debt of vengeance!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p><p>The clergyman's shy and sensitive reserve had balked thisscheme. Roger Chillingworth, however, was inclined to behardly, if at all, less satisfied with the aspect of affairs, whichProvidence—using the avenger and his victim for its own purposes,and, perchance, pardoning where it seemed most to punish—hadsubstituted for his black devices. A revelation, he couldalmost say, had been granted to him. It mattered little, for hisobject, whether celestial, or from what other region. By its aid,in all the subsequent relations betwixt him and Mr. Dimmesdale,not merely the external presence, but the very inmost soul, of thelatter, seemed to be brought out before his eyes, so that hecould see and comprehend its every movement. He became,thenceforth, not a spectator only, but a chief actor, in the poorminister's interior world. He could play upon him as he chose.Would he arouse him with a throb of agony? The victim wasforever on the rack; it needed only to know the spring that controlledthe engine;—and the physician knew it well! Wouldhe startle him with sudden fear? As at the waving of a magician'swand, uprose a grisly phantom,—uprose a thousand phantoms,—inmany shapes, of death, or more awful shame, allflocking round about the clergyman, and pointing with theirfingers at his breast!</p><p>All this was accomplished with a subtlety so perfect, that theminister, though he had constantly a dim perception of someevil influence watching over him, could never gain a knowledgeof its actual nature. True, he looked doubtfully, fearfully,—even,at times, with horror and the bitterness of hatred,—atthe deformed figure of the old physician. His gestures, his gait,his grizzled beard, his slightest and most indifferent acts, thevery fashion of his garments, were odious in the clergyman's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>sight; a token implicitly to be relied on, of a deeper antipathyin the breast of the latter than he was willing to acknowledgeto himself. For, as it was impossible to assign a reason forsuch distrust and abhorrence, so Mr. Dimmesdale, conscious thatthe poison of one morbid spot was infecting his heart's entiresubstance, attributed all his presentiments to no other cause.He took himself to task for his bad sympathies in reference toRoger Chillingworth, disregarded the lesson that he should havedrawn from them, and did his best to root them out. Unableto accomplish this, he nevertheless, as a matter of principle,continued his habits of social familiarity with the old man, andthus gave him constant opportunities for perfecting the purposeto which—poor, forlorn creature that he was, and more wretchedthan his victim—the avenger had devoted himself.</p><p>While thus suffering under bodily disease, and gnawed andtortured by some black trouble of the soul, and given overto the machinations of his deadliest enemy, the Reverend Mr.Dimmesdale had achieved a brilliant popularity in his sacredoffice. He won it, indeed, in great part, by his sorrows. Hisintellectual gifts, his moral perceptions, his power of experiencingand communicating emotion, were kept in a state ofpreternatural activity by the prick and anguish of his dailylife. His fame, though still on its upward slope, already overshadowedthe soberer reputations of his fellow-clergymen, eminentas several of them were. There were scholars among them, whohad spent more years in acquiring abstruse lore, connected withthe divine profession, than Mr. Dimmesdale had lived; and whomight well, therefore, be more profoundly versed in such solidand valuable attainments than their youthful brother. Therewere men, too, of a sturdier texture of mind than his, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>endowed with a far greater share of shrewd, hard, iron, or graniteunderstanding; which, duly mingled with a fair proportionof doctrinal ingredient, constitutes a highly respectable, efficacious,and unamiable variety of the clerical species. There wereothers, again, true saintly fathers, whose faculties had been elaboratedby weary toil among their books, and by patient thought,and etherealized, moreover, by spiritual communications with thebetter world, into which their purity of life had almost introducedthese holy personages, with their garments of mortalitystill clinging to them. All that they lacked was the gift thatdescended upon the chosen disciples at Pentecost, in tonguesof flame; symbolizing, it would seem, not the power of speechin foreign and unknown languages, but that of addressing thewhole human brotherhood in the heart's native language. Thesefathers, otherwise so apostolic, lacked Heaven's last and rarestattestation of their office, the Tongue of Flame. They wouldhave vainly sought—had they ever dreamed of seeking—toexpress the highest truths through the humblest medium offamiliar words and images. Their voices came down, afar and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>indistinctly, from the upper heights where they habitually dwelt.</p><div class="backleft" style="background-image: url(images/illu_172.jpg); height: 100%;"><div class="sandbag-left" style="width:280px; height:150px;"> </div><div class="sandbag-left" style="width:355px; height:250px;"> </div><p>Not improbably, it was to this latter class of men that Mr.Dimmesdale, by many of his traits of character, naturally belonged.To the high mountain-peaks of faith and sanctity he would haveclimbed, had not the tendency been thwarted by the burden,whatever it might be, of crime or anguish, beneath which it washis doom to totter. It kept him down, on a level with the lowest;him, the man of ethereal attributes, whose voice the angelsmight else have listened to and answered! But this very burdenit was, that gave him sympathies so intimate with the sinfulbrotherhood of mankind; so that his heart vibrated in unisonwith theirs, and received their pain into itself, and sent its ownthrob of pain through a thousand other hearts, in gushes ofsad, persuasive eloquence. Oftenest persuasive, but sometimesterrible! The people knew not the power that moved themthus. They deemed the young clergyman a miracle of holiness.They fancied him the mouthpiece of Heaven's messages of wisdom,and rebuke, and love. In their eyes, the very ground onwhich he trod was sanctified.The virgins ofhis church grew palearound him, victims ofa passion so imbued withreligious sentiment thatthey imagined it to beall religion,and broughtit openly, intheir whitebosoms, astheir mostacceptablesacrifice beforethe altar.The agedmembers ofhis flock, beholdingMr. Dimmesdale's frame so feeble, while they were themselvesso rugged in their infirmity, believed that he would goheavenward before them, and enjoined it upon their children,that their old bones should be buried close to their young pastor's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>holy grave. And, all this time, perchance, when poor Mr.Dimmesdale was thinking of his grave, he questioned with himselfwhether the grass would ever grow on it, because an accursedthing must there be buried!</p></div><p>It is inconceivable, the agony with which this public venerationtortured him! It was his genuine impulse to adore thetruth, and to reckon all things shadow-like, and utterly devoidof weight or value, that had not its divine essence as the lifewithin their life. Then, what was he?—a substance?—or thedimmest of all shadows? He longed to speak out, from hisown pulpit, at the full height of his voice, and tell the peoplewhat he was. “I, whom you behold in these black garmentsof the priesthood,—I, who ascend the sacred desk, and turnmy pale face heavenward, taking upon myself to hold communion,in your behalf, with the Most High Omniscience,—I, inwhose daily life you discern the sanctity of Enoch,—I, whosefootsteps, as you suppose, leave a gleam along my earthly track,whereby the pilgrims that shall come after me may be guidedto the regions of the blest,—I, who have laid the hand ofbaptism upon your children,—I, who have breathed the partingprayer over your dying friends, to whom the Amen soundedfaintly from a world which they had quitted,—I, your pastor,whom you so reverence and trust, am utterly a pollution anda lie!”</p><p>More than once, Mr. Dimmesdale had gone into the pulpit,with a purpose never to come down its steps, until he shouldhave spoken words like the above. More than once, he hadcleared his throat, and drawn in the long, deep, and tremulousbreath, which, when sent forth again, would come burdenedwith the black secret of his soul. More than once—nay, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>than a hundred times—he had actually spoken! Spoken!But how? He had told his hearers that he was altogether vile,a viler companion of the vilest, the worst of sinners, an abomination,a thing of unimaginable iniquity; and that the onlywonder was, that they did not see his wretched body shrivelledup before their eyes, by the burning wrath of the Almighty!Could there be plainer speech than this? Would not the peoplestart up in their seats, by a simultaneous impulse, and tear himdown out of the pulpit which he defiled? Not so, indeed!They heard it all, and did but reverence him the more. Theylittle guessed what deadly purport lurked in those self-condemningwords. “The godly youth!” said they among themselves.“The saint on earth! Alas, if he discern such sinfulness in hisown white soul, what horrid spectacle would he behold in thineor mine!” The minister well knew—subtle, but remorsefulhypocrite that he was!—the light in which his vague confessionwould be viewed. He had striven to put a cheat uponhimself by making the avowal of a guilty conscience, but hadgained only one other sin, and a self-acknowledged shame, withoutthe momentary relief of being self-deceived. He had spokenthe very truth, and transformed it into the veriest falsehood.And yet, by the constitution of his nature, he loved the truth,and loathed the lie, as few men ever did. Therefore, above allthings else, he loathed his miserable self!</p><p>His inward trouble drove him to practices more in accordancewith the old, corrupted faith of Rome, than with the betterlight of the church in which he had been born and bred. InMr. Dimmesdale's secret closet, under lock and key, there wasa bloody scourge. Oftentimes, this Protestant and Puritan divinehad plied it on his own shoulders; laughing bitterly at himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>the while, and smiting so much the more pitilessly because ofthat bitter laugh. It was his custom, too, as it has been thatof many other pious Puritans, to fast,—not, however, likethem, in order to purify the body and render it the fittermedium of celestial illumination, but rigorously, and until hisknees trembled beneath him, as an act of penance. He keptvigils, likewise, night after night, sometimes in utter darkness;sometimes with a glimmering lamp; and sometimes, viewinghis own face in a looking-glass, by the most powerful lightwhich he could throw upon it. He thus typified the constantintrospection wherewith he tortured, but could not purify, himself.In these lengthened vigils, his brain often reeled, andvisions seemed to flit before him; perhaps seen doubtfully,and by a faint light of their own, in the remote dimness ofthe chamber, or more vividly, and close beside him, withinthe looking-glass. Now it was a herd of diabolic shapes, thatgrinned and mocked at the pale minister, and beckoned himaway with them; now a group of shining angels, who flewupward heavily, as sorrow-laden, but grew more ethereal as theyrose. Now came the dead friends of his youth, and his white-beardedfather, with a saint-like frown, and his mother, turningher face away as she passed by. Ghost of a mother,—thinnestfantasy of a mother,—methinks she might yet have thrown apitying glance towards her son! And now, through the chamberwhich these spectral thoughts had made so ghastly, glided HesterPrynne, leading along little Pearl, in her scarlet garb, andpointing her forefinger, first at the scarlet letter on her bosom,and then at the clergyman's own breast.</p><p>None of these visions ever quite deluded him. At any moment,by an effort of his will, he could discern substances through their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>misty lack of substance, and convince himself that they were notsolid in their nature, like yonder table of carved oak, or that big,square, leathern-bound and brazen-clasped volume of divinity.But, for all that, they were, in one sense, the truest and mostsubstantial things which the poor minister now dealt with. Itis the unspeakable misery of a life so false as his, that it stealsthe pith and substance out of whatever realities there are aroundus, and which were meant by Heaven to be the spirit's joy andnutriment. To the untrue man, the whole universe is false,—itis impalpable,—it shrinks to nothing within his grasp. And hehimself, in so far as he shows himself in a false light, becomesa shadow, or, indeed, ceases to exist. The only truth that continuedto give Mr. Dimmesdale a real existence on this earth,was the anguish in his inmost soul, and the undissembled expressionof it in his aspect. Had he once found power to smile,and wear a face of gayety, there would have been no suchman!</p><p>On one of those ugly nights, which we have faintly hinted at,but forborne to picture forth, the minister started from his chair.A new thought had struck him. There might be a moment'speace in it. Attiring himself with as much care as if it hadbeen for public worship, and precisely in the same manner, hestole softly down the staircase, undid the door, and issued forth.</p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; padding-top: 1em"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_103.jpg" width="400" height="114" alt="" title=""></div><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; padding-top: 4em"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/ornament_iv.jpg" width="400" height="111" alt="" title=""></div><h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII.</h2><h4>THE MINISTER'S VIGIL.</h4><div class="initial"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/initial_w.jpg" alt="W" title="W"></div><p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">alking</span> in the shadow of a dream, as itwere, and perhaps actually under the influenceof a species of somnambulism, Mr.Dimmesdale reached the spot where, nowso long since, Hester Prynne had livedthrough her first hours of public ignominy.The same platform or scaffold, black and weather-stained withthe storm or sunshine of seven long years, and foot-worn, too,with the tread of many culprits who had since ascended it,remained standing beneath the balcony of the meeting-house.The minister went up the steps.</p><p>It was an obscure night of early May. An unvaried pall ofcloud muffled the whole expanse of sky from zenith to horizon.If the same multitude which had stood as eye-witnesses whileHester Prynne sustained her punishment could now have beensummoned forth, they would have discerned no face above theplatform, nor hardly the outline of a human shape, in the darkgray of the midnight. But the town was all asleep. Therewas no peril of discovery. The minister might stand there, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>it so pleased him, until morning should redden in the east,without other risk than that the dank and chill night-air wouldcreep into his frame, and stiffen his joints with rheumatism, andclog his throat with catarrh and cough; thereby defraudingthe expectant audience of to-morrow's prayer and sermon. Noeye could see him, save that ever-wakeful one which had seenhim in his closet, wielding the bloody scourge. Why, then,had he come hither? Was it but the mockery of penitence?A mockery, indeed, but in which his soul trifled with itself! Amockery at which angels blushed and wept, while fiends rejoiced,with jeering laughter! He had been driven hither by theimpulse of that Remorse which dogged him everywhere, andwhose own sister and closely linked companion was thatCowardice which invariably drew him back, with her tremulousgripe, just when the other impulse had hurried him to the vergeof a disclosure. Poor, miserable man! what right had infirmitylike his to burden itself with crime? Crime is for the iron-nerved,who have their choice either to endure it, or, if it presstoo hard, to exert their fierce and savage strength for a goodpurpose, and fling it off at once! This feeble and most sensitiveof spirits could do neither, yet continually did one thingor another, which intertwined, in the same inextricable knot, theagony of heaven-defying guilt and vain repentance.</p><p>And thus, while standing on the scaffold, in this vain showof expiation, Mr. Dimmesdale was overcome with a great horrorof mind, as if the universe were gazing at a scarlet token onhis naked breast, right over his heart. On that spot, in verytruth, there was, and there had long been, the gnawing andpoisonous tooth of bodily pain. Without any effort of his will,or power to restrain himself, he shrieked aloud; an outcry that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>went pealing through the night, and was beaten back from onehouse to another, and reverberated from the hills in the background;as if a company of devils, detecting so much miseryand terror in it, had made a plaything of the sound, and werebandying it to and fro.</p><p>“It is done!” muttered the minister, covering his face withhis hands. “The whole town will awake, and hurry forth, andfind me here!”</p><p>But it was not so. The shriek had perhaps sounded with afar greater power, to his own startled ears, than it actuallypossessed. The town did not awake; or, if it did, the drowsyslumberers mistook the cry either for something frightful in adream, or for the noise of witches; whose voices, at that period,were often heard to pass over the settlements or lonely cottages,as they rode with Satan through the air. The clergyman, therefore,hearing no symptoms of disturbance, uncovered his eyesand looked about him. At one of the chamber-windows ofGovernor Bellingham's mansion, which stood at some distance,on the line of another street, he beheld the appearance of theold magistrate himself, with a lamp in his hand, a white night-capon his head, and a long white gown enveloping his figure.He looked like a ghost, evoked unseasonably from the grave.The cry had evidently startled him. At another window of thesame house, moreover, appeared old Mistress Hibbins, the Governor'ssister, also with a lamp, which, even thus far off,revealed the expression of her sour and discontented face. Shethrust forth her head from the lattice, and looked anxiouslyupward. Beyond the shadow of a doubt, this venerable witch-ladyhad heard Mr. Dimmesdale's outcry, and interpreted it,with its multitudinous echoes and reverberations, as the clamor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>of the fiends and night-hags, with whom she was well known tomake excursions into the forest.</p><p>Detecting the gleam of Governor Bellingham's lamp, the oldlady quickly extinguished her own, and vanished. Possibly, shewent up among the clouds. The minister saw nothing furtherof her motions. The magistrate, after a wary observation of thedarkness,—into which, nevertheless, he could see but little furtherthan he might into a mill-stone,—retired from the window.</p><p>The minister grew comparatively calm. His eyes, however,were soon greeted by a little, glimmering light, which, at firsta long way off, was approaching up the street. It threw agleam of recognition on here a post, and there a garden-fence,and here a latticed window-pane, and there a pump, with itsfull trough of water, and here, again, an arched door of oak,with an iron knocker, and a rough log for the doorstep. TheReverend Mr. Dimmesdale noted all these minute particulars,even while firmly convinced that the doom of his existence wasstealing onward, in the footsteps which he now heard; and thatthe gleam of the lantern would fall upon him, in a few momentsmore, and reveal his long-hidden secret. As the light drewnearer, he beheld, within its illuminated circle, his brother clergyman,—or,to speak more accurately, his professional father, aswell as highly valued friend,—the Reverend Mr. Wilson; who,as Mr. Dimmesdale now conjectured, had been praying at thebedside of some dying man. And so he had. The good oldminister came freshly from the death-chamber of GovernorWinthrop, who had passed from earth to heaven within thatvery hour. And now, surrounded, like the saint-like personagesof olden times, with a radiant halo, that glorified him amidthis gloomy night of sin,—as if the departed Governor had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>left him an inheritance of his glory, or as if he had caughtupon himself the distant shine of the celestial city, while lookingthitherward to see the triumphant pilgrim pass within itsgates,—now, in short, good Father Wilson was moving homeward,aiding his footsteps with a lighted lantern! The glimmerof this luminary suggested the above conceits to Mr. Dimmesdale,who smiled,—nay, almost laughed at them,—and thenwondered if he were going mad.</p><p>As the Reverend Mr. Wilson passed beside the scaffold, closelymuffling his Geneva cloak about him with one arm, and holdingthe lantern before his breast with the other, the minister couldhardly restrain himself from speaking.</p><p>“A good evening to you, venerable Father Wilson! Comeup hither, I pray you, and pass a pleasant hour with me!”</p><p>Good heavens! Had Mr. Dimmesdale actually spoken? Forone instant, he believed that these words had passed his lips.But they were uttered only within his imagination. The venerableFather Wilson continued to step slowly onward, looking carefullyat the muddy pathway before his feet, and never once turninghis head towards the guilty platform. When the light of the glimmeringlantern had faded quite away, the minister discovered, bythe faintness which came over him, that the last few moments hadbeen a crisis of terrible anxiety; although his mind had made aninvoluntary effort to relieve itself by a kind of lurid playfulness.</p><p>Shortly afterwards, the like grisly sense of the humorous againstole in among the solemn phantoms of his thought. He felthis limbs growing stiff with the unaccustomed chilliness of thenight, and doubted whether he should be able to descend thesteps of the scaffold. Morning would break, and find him there.The neighborhood would begin to rouse itself. The earliest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>riser, coming forth in the dim twilight, would perceive a vaguelydefined figure aloft on the place of shame; and, half crazedbetwixt alarm and curiosity, would go, knocking from door todoor, summoning all the people to behold the ghost—as heneeds must think it—of some defunct transgressor. A duskytumult would flap its wings from one house to another. Then—themorning light still waxing stronger—old patriarchs wouldrise up in great haste, each in his flannel gown, and matronlydames, without pausing to put off their night-gear. The wholetribe of decorous personages, who had never heretofore been seenwith a single hair of their heads awry, would start into publicview, with the disorder of a nightmare in their aspects. OldGovernor Bellingham would come grimly forth, with his KingJames's ruff fastened askew; and Mistress Hibbins, with sometwigs of the forest clinging to her skirts, and looking sourerthan ever, as having hardly got a wink of sleep after her nightride; and good Father Wilson, too, after spending half thenight at a death-bed, and liking ill to be disturbed, thus early,out of his dreams about the glorified saints. Hither, likewise,would come the elders and deacons of Mr. Dimmesdale's church,and the young virgins who so idolized their minister, and hadmade a shrine for him in their white bosoms; which now, bythe by, in their hurry and confusion, they would scantly havegiven themselves time to cover with their kerchiefs. All people,in a word, would come stumbling over their thresholds, andturning up their amazed and horror-stricken visages around thescaffold. Whom would they discern there, with the red easternlight upon his brow? Whom, but the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale,half frozen to death, overwhelmed with shame, and standingwhere Hester Prynne had stood!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p><p>Carried away by the grotesque horror of this picture, the minister,unawares, and to his own infinite alarm, burst into a greatpeal of laughter. It was immediately responded to by a light,airy, childish laugh, in which, with a thrill of the heart,—buthe knew not whether of exquisite pain, or pleasure as acute,—herecognized the tones of little Pearl.</p><p>“Pearl! Little Pearl!” cried he after a moment's pause;then, suppressing his voice,—“Hester! Hester Prynne! Areyou there?”</p><p>“Yes; it is Hester Prynne!” she replied, in a tone of surprise;and the minister heard her footsteps approaching fromthe sidewalk, along which she had been passing. “It is I, andmy little Pearl.”</p><p>“Whence come you, Hester?” asked the minister. “Whatsent you hither?”</p><p>“I have been watching at a death-bed,” answered HesterPrynne;—“at Governor Winthrop's death-bed, and have taken hismeasure for a robe, and am now going homeward to my dwelling.”</p><p>“Come up hither, Hester, thou and little Pearl,” said theReverend Mr. Dimmesdale. “Ye have both been here before,but I was not with you. Come up hither once again, and wewill stand all three together!”</p><p>She silently ascended the steps, and stood on the platform,holding little Pearl by the hand. The minister felt for thechild's other hand, and took it. The moment that he did so,there came what seemed a tumultuous rush of new life, otherlife than his own, pouring like a torrent into his heart, andhurrying through all his veins, as if the mother and the childwere communicating their vital warmth to his half-torpid system.The three formed an electric chain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p><p>“Minister!” whispered little Pearl.</p><p>“What wouldst thou say, child?” asked Mr. Dimmesdale.</p><p>“Wilt thou stand here with mother and me, to-morrow noontide?”inquired Pearl.</p><p>“Nay; not so, my little Pearl,” answered the minister; for,with the new energy of the moment, all the dread of public exposure,that had so long been the anguish of his life, had returnedupon him; and he was already trembling at the conjunctionin which—with a strange joy, nevertheless—he now foundhimself. “Not so, my child. I shall, indeed, stand with thymother and thee one other day, but not to-morrow.”</p><p>Pearl laughed, and attempted to pull away her hand. Butthe minister held it fast.</p><p>“A moment longer, my child!” said he.</p><p>“But wilt thou promise,” asked Pearl, “to take my hand,and mother's hand, to-morrow noontide?”</p><p>“Not then, Pearl,” said the minister, “but another time.”</p><p>“And what other time?” persisted the child.</p><p>“At the great judgment day,” whispered the minister,—and,strangely enough, the sense that he was a professional teacherof the truth impelled him to answer the child so. “Then, andthere, before the judgment-seat, thy mother, and thou, and Imust stand together. But the daylight of this world shall notsee our meeting!”</p><p>Pearl laughed again.</p><p class="figcenter"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25344/25344-h/images/illu_185.jpg"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_185_th.jpg" alt="They stood in the noon of that strange splendor" title="They stood in the noon of that strange splendor"></a></p><p>But, before Mr. Dimmesdale had done speaking, a light gleamedfar and wide over all the muffled sky. It was doubtless caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>by one of those meteors, which the night-watcher may so oftenobserve burning out to waste, in the vacant regions of the atmosphere.So powerful was its radiance, that it thoroughly illuminated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>the dense medium of cloud betwixt the sky and earth.The great vault brightened, like the dome of an immense lamp.It showed the familiar scene of the street, with the distinctnessof mid-day, but also with the awfulness that is always impartedto familiar objects by an unaccustomed light. The woodenhouses, with their jutting stories and quaint gable-peaks; thedoorsteps and thresholds, with the early grass springing upabout them; the garden-plots, black with freshly turned earth;the wheel-track, little worn, and, even in the market-place, marginedwith green on either side;—all were visible, but witha singularity of aspect that seemed to give another moral interpretationto the things of this world than they had ever bornebefore. And there stood the minister, with his hand over hisheart; and Hester Prynne, with the embroidered letter glimmeringon her bosom; and little Pearl, herself a symbol, andthe connecting link between those two. They stood in the noonof that strange and solemn splendor, as if it were the light thatis to reveal all secrets, and the daybreak that shall unite allwho belong to one another.</p><p>There was witchcraft in little Pearl's eyes, and her face, asshe glanced upward at the minister, wore that naughty smilewhich made its expression frequently so elvish. She withdrewher hand from Mr. Dimmesdale's, and pointed across the street.But he clasped both his hands over his breast, and cast hiseyes towards the zenith.</p><p>Nothing was more common, in those days, than to interpretall meteoric appearances, and other natural phenomena, thatoccurred with less regularity than the rise and set of sun andmoon, as so many revelations from a supernatural source. Thus,a blazing spear, a sword of flame, a bow, or a sheaf of arrows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>seen in the midnight sky, prefigured Indian warfare. Pestilencewas known to have been foreboded by a shower of crimsonlight. We doubt whether any marked event, for good or evil,ever befell New England, from its settlement down to Revolutionarytimes, of which the inhabitants had not been previouslywarned by some spectacle of this nature. Not seldom, it hadbeen seen by multitudes. Oftener, however, its credibility restedon the faith of some lonely eye-witness, who beheld the wonderthrough the colored, magnifying, and distorting medium of hisimagination, and shaped it more distinctly in his after-thought.It was, indeed, a majestic idea, that the destiny of nationsshould be revealed, in these awful hieroglyphics, on the cope ofheaven. A scroll so wide might not be deemed too expansivefor Providence to write a people's doom upon. The belief wasa favorite one with our forefathers, as betokening that theirinfant commonwealth was under a celestial guardianship of peculiarintimacy and strictness. But what shall we say, when anindividual discovers a revelation addressed to himself alone, onthe same vast sheet of record! In such a case, it could onlybe the symptom of a highly disordered mental state, when aman, rendered morbidly self-contemplative by long, intense, andsecret pain, had extended his egotism over the whole expanse ofnature, until the firmament itself should appear no more thana fitting page for his soul's history and fate!</p><p>We impute it, therefore, solely to the disease in his own eyeand heart, that the minister, looking upward to the zenith,beheld there the appearance of an immense letter,—the letterA,—marked out in lines of dull red light. Not but themeteor may have shown itself at that point, burning duskilythrough a veil of cloud; but with no such shape as his guilty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>imagination gave it; or, at least, with so little definiteness, thatanother's guilt might have seen another symbol in it.</p><p>There was a singular circumstance that characterized Mr.Dimmesdale's psychological state, at this moment. All the timethat he gazed upward to the zenith, he was, nevertheless, perfectlyaware that little Pearl was pointing her finger towardsold Roger Chillingworth, who stood at no great distance fromthe scaffold. The minister appeared to see him, with the sameglance that discerned the miraculous letter. To his features, asto all other objects, the meteoric light imparted a new expression;or it might well be that the physician was not carefulthen, as at all other times, to hide the malevolence with whichhe looked upon his victim. Certainly, if the meteor kindled upthe sky, and disclosed the earth, with an awfulness that admonishedHester Prynne and the clergyman of the day of judgment,then might Roger Chillingworth have passed with them for thearch-fiend, standing there with a smile and scowl, to claim hisown. So vivid was the expression, or so intense the minister'sperception of it, that it seemed still to remain painted on thedarkness, after the meteor had vanished, with an effect as ifthe street and all things else were at once annihilated.</p><p>“Who is that man, Hester?” gasped Mr. Dimmesdale, overcomewith terror. “I shiver at him! Dost thou know theman? I hate him, Hester!”</p><p>She remembered her oath, and was silent.</p><p>“I tell thee, my soul shivers at him!” muttered the ministeragain. “Who is he? Who is he? Canst thou do nothingfor me? I have a nameless horror of the man!”</p><p>“Minister,” said little Pearl, “I can tell thee who he is!”</p><p>“Quickly, then, child!” said the minister, bending his ear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>close to her lips. “Quickly!—and as low as thou canstwhisper.”</p><p>Pearl mumbled something into his ear, that sounded, indeed,like human language, but was only such gibberish as childrenmay be heard amusing themselves with, by the hour together.At all events, if it involved any secret information in regard toold Roger Chillingworth, it was in a tongue unknown to theerudite clergyman, and did but increase the bewilderment of hismind. The elvish child then laughed aloud.</p><p>“Dost thou mock me now?” said the minister.</p><p>“Thou wast not bold!—thou wast not true!”—answeredthe child. “Thou wouldst not promise to take my hand, andmother's hand, to-morrow noontide!”</p><p>“Worthy Sir,” answered the physician, who had now advancedto the foot of the platform. “Pious Master Dimmesdale, canthis be you? Well, well, indeed! We men of study, whoseheads are in our books, have need to be straitly looked after!We dream in our waking moments, and walk in our sleep.Come, good Sir, and my dear friend, I pray you, let me leadyou home!”</p><p>“How knewest thou that I was here?” asked the minister,fearfully.</p><p>“Verily, and in good faith,” answered Roger Chillingworth,“I knew nothing of the matter. I had spent the better partof the night at the bedside of the worshipful Governor Winthrop,doing what my poor skill might to give him ease. He goinghome to a better world, I, likewise, was on my way homeward,when this strange light shone out. Come with me, I beseechyou, Reverend Sir; else you will be poorly able to do Sabbathduty to-morrow. Aha! see now, how they trouble the brain,—these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>books!—these books! You should study less, goodSir, and take a little pastime; or these night-whimseys willgrow upon you.”</p><p>“I will go home with you,” said Mr. Dimmesdale.</p><p>With a chill despondency, like one awaking, all nerveless,from an ugly dream, he yielded himself to the physician, andwas led away.</p><p>The next day, however, being the Sabbath, he preached adiscourse which was held to be the richest and most powerful,and the most replete with heavenly influences, that had everproceeded from his lips. Souls, it is said more souls than one,were brought to the truth by the efficacy of that sermon, andvowed within themselves to cherish a holy gratitude towardsMr. Dimmesdale throughout the long hereafter. But, as hecame down the pulpit steps, the gray-bearded sexton met him,holding up a black glove, which the minister recognized as hisown.</p><p>“It was found,” said the sexton, “this morning, on thescaffold where evil-doers are set up to public shame. Satandropped it there, I take it, intending a scurrilous jest againstyour reverence. But, indeed, he was blind and foolish, as heever and always is. A pure hand needs no glove to cover it!”</p><p>“Thank you, my good friend,” said the minister, gravely,but startled at heart; for, so confused was his remembrance,that he had almost brought himself to look at the events ofthe past night as visionary. “Yes, it seems to be my glove,indeed!”</p><p>“And since Satan saw fit to steal it, your reverence mustneeds handle him without gloves, henceforward,” remarked theold sexton, grimly smiling. “But did your reverence hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>of the portent that was seen last night?—a great red letter inthe sky,—the letter A, which we interpret to stand for Angel.For, as our good Governor Winthrop was made an angel thispast night, it was doubtless held fit that there should be somenotice thereof!”</p><p>“No,” answered the minister, “I had not heard of it.”</p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px; padding-top: 1em"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_192.jpg" width="300" height="80" alt="" title=""></div><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; padding-top: 4em"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/ornament_v.jpg" width="400" height="110" alt="" title=""></div><h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>XIII.</h2><h4>ANOTHER VIEW OF HESTER.</h4><div class="initial"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/initial_i.jpg" alt="I" title="I"></div><p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">n</span> her late singular interview with Mr. Dimmesdale,Hester Prynne was shocked at the conditionto which she found the clergyman reduced.His nerve seemed absolutely destroyed. Hismoral force was abased into more than childishweakness. It grovelled helpless on the ground,even while his intellectual faculties retained their pristine strength,or had perhaps acquired a morbid energy, which disease onlycould have given them. With her knowledge of a train ofcircumstances hidden from all others, she could readily inferthat, besides the legitimate action of his own conscience, aterrible machinery had been brought to bear, and was stilloperating, on Mr. Dimmesdale's well-being and repose. Knowingwhat this poor, fallen man had once been, her whole soulwas moved by the shuddering terror with which he had appealedto her,—the outcast woman,—for support against his instinctivelydiscovered enemy. She decided, moreover, that he had aright to her utmost aid. Little accustomed, in her long seclusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>from society, to measure her ideas of right and wrong by anystandard external to herself, Hester saw—or seemed to see—thatthere lay a responsibility upon her, in reference to theclergyman, which she owed to no other, nor to the whole worldbesides. The links that united her to the rest of human kind—linksof flowers, or silk, or gold, or whatever the material—hadall been broken. Here was the iron link of mutual crime,which neither he nor she could break. Like all other ties, itbrought along with it its obligations.</p><p>Hester Prynne did not now occupy precisely the same positionin which we beheld her during the earlier periods of herignominy. Years had come and gone. Pearl was now sevenyears old. Her mother, with the scarlet letter on her breast,glittering in its fantastic embroidery, had long been a familiarobject to the towns-people. As is apt to be the case when aperson stands out in any prominence before the community, and,at the same time, interferes neither with public nor individualinterests and convenience, a species of general regard had ultimatelygrown up in reference to Hester Prynne. It is to thecredit of human nature, that, except where its selfishness isbrought into play, it loves more readily than it hates. Hatred,by a gradual and quiet process, will even be transformed to love,unless the change be impeded by a continually new irritationof the original feeling of hostility. In this matter of HesterPrynne, there was neither irritation nor irksomeness. She neverbattled with the public, but submitted, uncomplainingly, to itsworst usage; she made no claim upon it, in requital for whatshe suffered; she did not weigh upon its sympathies. Then,also, the blameless purity of her life during all these years inwhich she had been set apart to infamy, was reckoned largelyin her favor. With nothing now to lose, in the sight of mankind,and with no hope, and seemingly no wish, of gaining anything,it could only be a genuine regard for virtue that hadbrought back the poor wanderer to its paths.</p><p class="figcenter"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25344/25344-h/images/illu_195.jpg"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_195_th.jpg" alt="Hester in the House of Mourning" title="Hester in the House of Mourning"></a></p><p>It was perceived, too, that while Hester never put forwardeven the humblest title to share in the world's privileges,—furtherthan to breathe the common air, and earn daily breadfor little Pearl and herself by the faithful labor of her hands,—shewas quick to acknowledge her sisterhood with the race ofman, whenever benefits were to be conferred. None so readyas she to give of her little substance to every demand of poverty;even though the bitter-hearted pauper threw back a gibein requital of the food brought regularly to his door, or thegarments wrought for him by the fingers that could have embroidered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>a monarch's robe. None so self-devoted as Hester,when pestilence stalked through the town. In all seasons ofcalamity, indeed, whether general or of individuals, the outcastof society at once found her place. She came, not as a guest,but as a rightful inmate, into the household that was darkenedby trouble; as if its gloomy twilight were a medium in whichshe was entitled to hold intercourse with her fellow-creatures.There glimmered the embroidered letter, with comfort in itsunearthly ray. Elsewhere the token of sin, it was the taperof the sick-chamber. It had even thrown its gleam, in the sufferer'shard extremity, across the verge of time. It had shownhim where to set his foot, while the light of earth was fastbecoming dim, and ere the light of futurity could reach him.In such emergencies, Hester's nature showed itself warm andrich; a well-spring of human tenderness, unfailing to every realdemand, and inexhaustible by the largest. Her breast, with itsbadge of shame, was but the softer pillow for the head thatneeded one. She was self-ordained a Sister of Mercy; or, wemay rather say, the world's heavy hand had so ordained her,when neither the world nor she looked forward to this result.The letter was the symbol of her calling. Such helpfulness wasfound in her,—so much power to do, and power to sympathize,—thatmany people refused to interpret the scarlet A byits original signification. They said that it meant Able; sostrong was Hester Prynne, with a woman's strength.</p><p>It was only the darkened house that could contain her. Whensunshine came again, she was not there. Her shadow had fadedacross the threshold. The helpful inmate had departed, withoutone backward glance to gather up the meed of gratitude, if anywere in the hearts of those whom she had served so zealously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>Meeting them in the street, she never raised her head to receivetheir greeting. If they were resolute to accost her, she laid herfinger on the scarlet letter, and passed on. This might be pride,but was so like humility, that it produced all the softening influenceof the latter quality on the public mind. The public isdespotic in its temper; it is capable of denying common justice,when too strenuously demanded as a right; but quite as frequentlyit awards more than justice, when the appeal is made,as despots love to have it made, entirely to its generosity. InterpretingHester Prynne's deportment as an appeal of this nature,society was inclined to show its former victim a more benigncountenance than she cared to be favored with, or, perchance,than she deserved.</p><p>The rulers, and the wise and learned men of the community,were longer in acknowledging the influence of Hester's goodqualities than the people. The prejudices which they shared incommon with the latter were fortified in themselves by an ironframework of reasoning, that made it a far tougher labor toexpel them. Day by day, nevertheless, their sour and rigidwrinkles were relaxing into something which, in the due courseof years, might grow to be an expression of almost benevolence.Thus it was with the men of rank, on whom their eminent positionimposed the guardianship of the public morals. Individualsin private life, meanwhile, had quite forgiven Hester Prynne forher frailty; nay, more, they had begun to look upon the scarletletter as the token, not of that one sin, for which she had borneso long and dreary a penance, but of her many good deeds since.“Do you see that woman with the embroidered badge?” theywould say to strangers. “It is our Hester,—the town's ownHester, who is so kind to the poor, so helpful to the sick, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>comfortable to the afflicted!” Then, it is true, the propensityof human nature to tell the very worst of itself, when embodiedin the person of another, would constrain them to whisper theblack scandal of bygone years. It was none the less a fact,however, that, in the eyes of the very men who spoke thus, thescarlet letter had the effect of the cross on a nun's bosom. Itimparted to the wearer a kind of sacredness, which enabled herto walk securely amid all peril. Had she fallen among thieves,it would have kept her safe. It was reported, and believed bymany, that an Indian had drawn his arrow against the badge,and that the missile struck it, but fell harmless to the ground.</p><p>The effect of the symbol—or, rather, of the position in respectto society that was indicated by it—on the mind of HesterPrynne herself, was powerful and peculiar. All the light andgraceful foliage of her character had been withered up by thisred-hot brand, and had long ago fallen away, leaving a bare andharsh outline, which might have been repulsive, had she possessedfriends or companions to be repelled by it. Even theattractiveness of her person had undergone a similar change. Itmight be partly owing to the studied austerity of her dress, andpartly to the lack of demonstration in her manners. It wasa sad transformation, too, that her rich and luxuriant hairhad either been cut off, or was so completely hidden by a cap,that not a shining lock of it ever once gushed into the sunshine.It was due in part to all these causes, but still moreto something else, that there seemed to be no longer anythingin Hester's face for Love to dwell upon; nothing in Hester'sform, though majestic and statue-like, that Passion would everdream of clasping in its embrace; nothing in Hester's bosom,to make it ever again the pillow of Affection. Some attribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>had departed from her, the permanence of which had been essentialto keep her a woman. Such is frequently the fate, andsuch the stern development, of the feminine character and person,when the woman has encountered, and lived through, anexperience of peculiar severity. If she be all tenderness, shewill die. If she survive, the tenderness will either be crushedout of her, or—and the outward semblance is the same—crushedso deeply into her heart that it can never show itselfmore. The latter is perhaps the truest theory. She who hasonce been woman, and ceased to be so, might at any momentbecome a woman again if there were only the magic touch toeffect the transfiguration. We shall see whether Hester Prynnewere ever afterwards so touched, and so transfigured.</p><p>Much of the marble coldness of Hester's impression was tobe attributed to the circumstance, that her life had turned, ina great measure, from passion and feeling, to thought. Standingalone in the world,—alone, as to any dependence on society,and with little Pearl to be guided and protected,—alone, andhopeless of retrieving her position, even had she not scorned toconsider it desirable,—she cast away the fragments of a brokenchain. The world's law was no law for her mind. It was anage in which the human intellect, newly emancipated, had takena more active and a wider range than for many centuries before.Men of the sword had overthrown nobles and kings. Menbolder than these had overthrown and rearranged—not actually,but within the sphere of theory, which was their most real abode—thewhole system of ancient prejudice, wherewith was linkedmuch of ancient principle. Hester Prynne imbibed this spirit.She assumed a freedom of speculation, then common enough onthe other side of the Atlantic, but which our forefathers, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>they known it, would have held to be a deadlier crime thanthat stigmatized by the scarlet letter. In her lonesome cottage,by the sea-shore, thoughts visited her, such as dared to enter noother dwelling in New England; shadowy guests, that wouldhave been as perilous as demons to their entertainer, could theyhave been seen so much as knocking at her door.</p><p>It is remarkable, that persons who speculate the most boldlyoften conform with the most perfect quietude to the externalregulations of society. The thought suffices them, withoutinvesting itself in the flesh and blood of action. So it seemedto be with Hester. Yet, had little Pearl never come to herfrom the spiritual world, it might have been far otherwise.Then, she might have come down to us in history, hand inhand with Ann Hutchinson, as the foundress of a religioussect. She might, in one of her phases, have been a prophetess.She might, and not improbably would, have suffered deathfrom the stern tribunals of the period, for attempting to underminethe foundations of the Puritan establishment. But, in theeducation of her child, the mother's enthusiasm of thought hadsomething to wreak itself upon. Providence, in the person ofthis little girl, had assigned to Hester's charge the germ andblossom of womanhood, to be cherished and developed amid ahost of difficulties. Everything was against her. The worldwas hostile. The child's own nature had something wrong init, which continually betokened that she had been born amiss,—theeffluence of her mother's lawless passion,—and often impelledHester to ask, in bitterness of heart, whether it were for illor good that the poor little creature had been born at all.</p><p>Indeed, the same dark question often rose into her mind,with reference to the whole race of womanhood. Was existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>worth accepting, even to the happiest among them? As concernedher own individual existence, she had long ago decidedin the negative, and dismissed the point as settled. A tendencyto speculation, though it may keep woman quiet, as it doesman, yet makes her sad. She discerns, it may be, such a hopelesstask before her. As a first step, the whole system of societyis to be torn down, and built up anew. Then, the very natureof the opposite sex, or its long hereditary habit, which hasbecome like nature, is to be essentially modified, before womancan be allowed to assume what seems a fair and suitable position.Finally, all other difficulties being obviated, woman cannottake advantage of these preliminary reforms, until she herselfshall have undergone a still mightier change; in which, perhaps,the ethereal essence, wherein she has her truest life, will befound to have evaporated. A woman never overcomes theseproblems by any exercise of thought. They are not to besolved, or only in one way. If her heart chance to come uppermost,they vanish. Thus, Hester Prynne, whose heart had lostits regular and healthy throb, wandered without a clew in thedark labyrinth of mind; now turned aside by an insurmountableprecipice; now starting back from a deep chasm. There waswild and ghastly scenery all around her, and a home and comfortnowhere. At times, a fearful doubt strove to possess hersoul, whether it were not better to send Pearl at once to heaven,and go herself to such futurity as Eternal Justice should provide.</p><p>The scarlet letter had not done its office.</p><p>Now, however, her interview with the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale,on the night of his vigil, had given her a new theme ofreflection, and held up to her an object that appeared worthyof any exertion and sacrifice for its attainment. She had witnessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>the intense misery beneath which the minister struggled,or, to speak more accurately, had ceased to struggle. She sawthat he stood on the verge of lunacy, if he had not alreadystepped across it. It was impossible to doubt, that, whateverpainful efficacy there might be in the secret sting of remorse, adeadlier venom had been infused into it by the hand that profferedrelief. A secret enemy had been continually by his side,under the semblance of a friend and helper, and had availedhimself of the opportunities thus afforded for tampering with thedelicate springs of Mr. Dimmesdale's nature. Hester could notbut ask herself, whether there had not originally been a defectof truth, courage, and loyalty, on her own part, in allowing theminister to be thrown into a position where so much evil wasto be foreboded, and nothing auspicious to be hoped. Her onlyjustification lay in the fact, that she had been able to discernno method of rescuing him from a blacker ruin than had overwhelmedherself, except by acquiescing in Roger Chillingworth'sscheme of disguise. Under that impulse, she had made herchoice, and had chosen, as it now appeared, the more wretchedalternative of the two. She determined to redeem her error, sofar as it might yet be possible. Strengthened by years of hardand solemn trial, she felt herself no longer so inadequate tocope with Roger Chillingworth as on that night, abased by sin,and half maddened by the ignominy that was still new, whenthey had talked together in the prison-chamber. She had climbedher way, since then, to a higher point. The old man, on theother hand, had brought himself nearer to her level, or perhapsbelow it, by the revenge which he had stooped for.</p><p>In fine, Hester Prynne resolved to meet her former husband,and do what might be in her power for the rescue of the victim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>on whom he had so evidently set his gripe. The occasion wasnot long to seek. One afternoon, walking with Pearl in aretired part of the peninsula, she beheld the old physician, witha basket on one arm, and a staff in the other hand, stoopingalong the ground, in quest of roots and herbs to concoct hismedicines withal.</p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px; padding-top: 1em"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_203.jpg" width="300" height="231" alt="" title=""></div><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; padding-top: 4em"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/ornament_iii.jpg" width="400" height="111" alt="" title=""></div><h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV.</h2><h4>HESTER AND THE PHYSICIAN.</h4><div class="initial"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/initial_h.jpg" alt="H" title="H"></div><p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">ester</span> bade little Pearl run down to themargin of the water, and play with the shellsand tangled sea-weed, until she should havetalked awhile with yonder gatherer of herbs.So the child flew away like a bird, and,making bare her small white feet, went patteringalong the moist margin of the sea. Here and there shecame to a full stop, and peeped curiously into a pool, left bythe retiring tide as a mirror for Pearl to see her face in. Forthpeeped at her, out of the pool, with dark, glistening curls aroundher head, and an elf-smile in her eyes, the image of a littlemaid, whom Pearl, having no other playmate, invited to takeher hand, and run a race with her. But the visionary littlemaid, on her part, beckoned likewise, as if to say,—“This isa better place! Come thou into the pool!” And Pearl, steppingin, mid-leg deep, beheld her own white feet at the bottom;while, out of a still lower depth, came the gleam of a kind offragmentary smile, floating to and fro in the agitated water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p><p>Meanwhile, her mother had accosted the physician.</p><p>“I would speak a word with you,” said she,—“a word thatconcerns us much.”</p><p>“Aha! and is it Mistress Hester that has a word for oldRoger Chillingworth?” answered he, raising himself from hisstooping posture. “With all my heart! Why, Mistress, I heargood tidings of you on all hands! No longer ago than yester-eve,a magistrate, a wise and godly man, was discoursing ofyour affairs, Mistress Hester, and whispered me that there hadbeen question concerning you in the council. It was debatedwhether or no, with safety to the common weal, yonder scarletletter might be taken off your bosom. On my life, Hester, Imade my entreaty to the worshipful magistrate that it mightbe done forthwith!”</p><p>“It lies not in the pleasure of the magistrates to take offthis badge,” calmly replied Hester. “Were I worthy to bequit of it, it would fall away of its own nature, or be transformedinto something that should speak a different purport.”</p><p>“Nay, then, wear it, if it suit you better,” rejoined he. “Awoman must needs follow her own fancy, touching the adornmentof her person. The letter is gayly embroidered, and showsright bravely on your bosom!”</p><p>All this while, Hester had been looking steadily at the oldman, and was shocked, as well as wonder-smitten, to discernwhat a change had been wrought upon him within the pastseven years. It was not so much that he had grown older; forthough the traces of advancing life were visible, he bore his agewell, and seemed to retain a wiry vigor and alertness. Butthe former aspect of an intellectual and studious man, calm andquiet, which was what she best remembered in him, had altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>vanished, and been succeeded by an eager, searching,almost fierce, yet carefully guarded look. It seemed to be hiswish and purpose to mask this expression with a smile; butthe latter played him false, and flickered over his visage so derisively,that the spectator could see his blackness all the betterfor it. Ever and anon, too, there came a glare of red light outof his eyes; as if the old man's soul were on fire, and kept onsmouldering duskily within his breast, until, by some casualpuff of passion, it was blown into a momentary flame. Thishe repressed, as speedily as possible, and strove to look as ifnothing of the kind had happened.</p><p>In a word, old Roger Chillingworth was a striking evidenceof man's faculty of transforming himself into a devil, if he willonly, for a reasonable space of time, undertake a devil's office.This unhappy person had effected such a transformation, bydevoting himself, for seven years, to the constant analysis of aheart full of torture, and deriving his enjoyment thence, andadding fuel to those fiery tortures which he analyzed and gloatedover.</p><p>The scarlet letter burned on Hester Prynne's bosom. Herewas another ruin, the responsibility of which came partly hometo her.</p><p>“What see you in my face,” asked the physician, “that youlook at it so earnestly?”</p><p>“Something that would make me weep, if there were anytears bitter enough for it,” answered she. “But let it pass!It is of yonder miserable man that I would speak.”</p><p>“And what of him?” cried Roger Chillingworth, eagerly,as if he loved the topic, and were glad of an opportunity todiscuss it with the only person of whom he could make a confidant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>“Not to hide the truth, Mistress Hester, my thoughtshappen just now to be busy with the gentleman. So speakfreely; and I will make answer.”</p><p>“When we last spake together,” said Hester, “now sevenyears ago, it was your pleasure to extort a promise of secrecy,as touching the former relation betwixt yourself and me. Asthe life and good fame of yonder man were in your hands,there seemed no choice to me, save to be silent, in accordancewith your behest. Yet it was not without heavy misgivingsthat I thus bound myself; for, having cast off all duty towardsother human beings, there remained a duty towards him; andsomething whispered me that I was betraying it, in pledgingmyself to keep your counsel. Since that day, no man is sonear to him as you. You tread behind his every footstep. Youare beside him, sleeping and waking. You search his thoughts.You burrow and rankle in his heart! Your clutch is on hislife, and you cause him to die daily a living death; and stillhe knows you not. In permitting this, I have surely acted afalse part by the only man to whom the power was left me tobe true!”</p><p>“What choice had you?” asked Roger Chillingworth. “Myfinger, pointed at this man, would have hurled him from hispulpit into a dungeon,—thence, peradventure, to the gallows!”</p><p>“It had been better so!” said Hester Prynne.</p><p>“What evil have I done the man?” asked Roger Chillingworthagain. “I tell thee, Hester Prynne, the richest fee thatever physician earned from monarch could not have boughtsuch care as I have wasted on this miserable priest! But formy aid, his life would have burned away in torments, withinthe first two years after the perpetration of his crime and thine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>For, Hester, his spirit lacked the strength that could have borneup, as thine has, beneath a burden like thy scarlet letter. O,I could reveal a goodly secret! But enough! What art cando, I have exhausted on him. That he now breathes, andcreeps about on earth, is owing all to me!”</p><p>“Better he had died at once!” said Hester Prynne.</p><p>“Yea, woman, thou sayest truly!” cried old Roger Chillingworth,letting the lurid fire of his heart blaze out before hereyes. “Better had he died at once! Never did mortal sufferwhat this man has suffered. And all, all, in the sight of hisworst enemy! He has been conscious of me. He has felt aninfluence dwelling always upon him like a curse. He knew, bysome spiritual sense,—for the Creator never made anotherbeing so sensitive as this,—he knew that no friendly hand waspulling at his heart-strings, and that an eye was looking curiouslyinto him, which sought only evil, and found it. But heknew not that the eye and hand were mine! With the superstitioncommon to his brotherhood, he fancied himself givenover to a fiend, to be tortured with frightful dreams, anddesperate thoughts, the sting of remorse, and despair of pardon;as a foretaste of what awaits him beyond the grave. But itwas the constant shadow of my presence!—the closest propinquityof the man whom he had most vilely wronged!—andwho had grown to exist only by this perpetual poison of thedirest revenge! Yea, indeed!—he did not err!—there was afiend at his elbow! A mortal man, with once a human heart,has become a fiend for his especial torment!”</p><p>The unfortunate physician, while uttering these words, liftedhis hands with a look of horror, as if he had beheld somefrightful shape, which he could not recognize, usurping the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>place of his own image in a glass. It was one of those moments—whichsometimes occur only at the interval of years—whena man's moral aspect is faithfully revealed to his mind's eye.Not improbably, he had never before viewed himself as he did now.</p><p>“Hast thou not tortured him enough?” said Hester, noticingthe old man's look. “Has he not paid thee all?”</p><p>“No!—no!—He has but increased the debt!” answeredthe physician; and as he proceeded his manner lost its fiercercharacteristics, and subsided into gloom. “Dost thou rememberme, Hester, as I was nine years agone? Even then, I was inthe autumn of my days, nor was it the early autumn. But allmy life had been made up of earnest, studious, thoughtful, quietyears, bestowed faithfully for the increase of mine own knowledge,and faithfully, too, though this latter object was butcasual to the other,—faithfully for the advancement of humanwelfare. No life had been more peaceful and innocent thanmine; few lives so rich with benefits conferred. Dost thouremember me? Was I not, though you might deem me cold,nevertheless a man thoughtful for others, craving little for himself,—kind,true, just, and of constant, if not warm affections?Was I not all this?”</p><p>“All this, and more,” said Hester.</p><p>“And what am I now?” demanded he, looking into her face,and permitting the whole evil within him to be written on hisfeatures. “I have already told thee what I am! A fiend! Whomade me so?”</p><p>“It was myself!” cried Hester, shuddering. “It was I, notless than he. Why hast thou not avenged thyself on me?”</p><p>“I have left thee to the scarlet letter,” replied Roger Chillingworth.“If that have not avenged me, I can do no more!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>”</p><p>He laid his finger on it, with a smile.</p><p>“It has avenged thee!” answered Hester Prynne.</p><p>“I judged no less,” said the physician. “And now, whatwouldst thou with me touching this man?”</p><p>“I must reveal the secret,” answered Hester, firmly. “Hemust discern thee in thy true character. What may be theresult, I know not. But this long debt of confidence, due fromme to him, whose bane and ruin I have been, shall at length bepaid. So far as concerns the overthrow or preservation of hisfair fame and his earthly state, and perchance his life, he is inthy hands. Nor do I,—whom the scarlet letter has disciplinedto truth, though it be the truth of red-hot iron, entering intothe soul,—nor do I perceive such advantage in his living anylonger a life of ghastly emptiness, that I shall stoop to implorethy mercy. Do with him as thou wilt! There is no good forhim,—no good for me,—no good for thee! There is no goodfor little Pearl! There is no path to guide us out of this dismalmaze!”</p><p>“Woman, I could wellnigh pity thee!” said Roger Chillingworth,unable to restrain a thrill of admiration too; for therewas a quality almost majestic in the despair which she expressed.“Thou hadst great elements. Peradventure, hadst thou metearlier with a better love than mine, this evil had not been. Ipity thee, for the good that has been wasted in thy nature!”</p><p>“And I thee,” answered Hester Prynne, “for the hatred thathas transformed a wise and just man to a fiend! Wilt thouyet purge it out of thee, and be once more human? If notfor his sake, then doubly for thine own! Forgive, and leavehis further retribution to the Power that claims it!

By thy first step awry thou didst plant the germ ofevil; but since that moment, it has all been a dark necessity.Ye that have wronged me are not sinful, save in a kind oftypical illusion; neither am I fiend-like, who have snatched afiend's office from his hands.

He gathered here and there an herb,or grubbed up a root, and put it into thebasket on his arm. His gray beard almost touched the ground,as he crept onward. Hester gazed after him a little while, lookingwith a half-fantastic curiosity to see whether the tender grassof early spring would not be blighted beneath him, and showthe wavering track of his footsteps, sere and brown, across itscheerful verdure. She wondered what sort of herbs they were,which the old man was so sedulous to gather. Would not theearth, quickened to an evil purpose by the sympathy of his eye,greet him with poisonous shrubs, of species hitherto unknown,that would start up under his fingers? Or might it sufficehim, that every wholesome growth should be converted intosomething deleterious and malignant at his touch? Did thesun, which shone so brightly everywhere else, really fall uponhim? Or was there, as it rather seemed, a circle of ominousshadow moving along with his deformity, whichever way heturned himself? And whither was he now going? Would henot suddenly sink into the earth, leaving a barren and blastedspot, where, in due course of time, would be seen deadly nightshade,dogwood, henbane, and whatever else of vegetable wickednessthe climate could produce, all flourishing with hideousluxuriance? Or would he spread bat's wings and flee away,looking so much the uglier, the higher he rose towards heaven?</p><p class="figcenter"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25344/25344-h/images/illu_213.jpg"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_213_th.jpg" alt="He gathered herbs here and there" title="He gathered herbs here and there"></a></p><p>“Be it sin or no,” said Hester Prynne, bitterly, as she still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>gazed after him, “I hate the man!”</p><p>She upbraided herself for the sentiment, but could not overcomeor lessen it. Attempting to do so, she thought of thoselong-past days, in a distant land, when he used to emerge ateventide from the seclusion of his study, and sit down in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>firelight of their home, and in the light of her nuptial smile.He needed to bask himself in that smile, he said, in order thatthe chill of so many lonely hours among his books might betaken off the scholar's heart. Such scenes had once appearednot otherwise than happy, but now, as viewed through the dismalmedium of her subsequent life, they classed themselves amongher ugliest remembrances. She marvelled how such scenes couldhave been! She marvelled how she could ever have been wroughtupon to marry him! She deemed it her crime most to berepented of, that she had ever endured, and reciprocated, thelukewarm grasp of his hand, and had suffered the smile of herlips and eyes to mingle and melt into his own. And it seemeda fouler offence committed by Roger Chillingworth, than anywhich had since been done him, that, in the time when her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>heart knew no better, he had persuaded her to fancy herselfhappy by his side.</p><p>“Yes, I hate him!” repeated Hester, more bitterly thanbefore. “He betrayed me! He has done me worse wrongthan I did him!”</p><p>Let men tremble to win the hand of woman, unless they winalong with it the utmost passion of her heart! Else it may betheir miserable fortune, as it was Roger Chillingworth's, whensome mightier touch than their own may have awakened all hersensibilities, to be reproached even for the calm content, themarble image of happiness, which they will have imposed uponher as the warm reality. But Hester ought long ago to havedone with this injustice. What did it betoken? Had sevenlong years, under the torture of the scarlet letter, inflicted somuch of misery, and wrought out no repentance?</p><p>The emotions of that brief space, while she stood gazing afterthe crooked figure of old Roger Chillingworth, threw a darklight on Hester's state of mind, revealing much that she mightnot otherwise have acknowledged to herself.</p><p>He being gone, she summoned back her child.</p><p>“Pearl! Little Pearl! Where are you?”</p><p class="figcenter"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25344/25344-h/images/illu_217.jpg"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_217_th.jpg" alt="Pearl on the Sea-shore" title="Pearl on the Sea-shore"></a></p><p>Pearl, whose activity of spirit never flagged, had been at noloss for amusement while her mother talked with the old gathererof herbs. At first, as already told, she had flirted fancifullywith her own image in a pool of water, beckoning the phantomforth, and—as it declined to venture—seeking a passage forherself into its sphere of impalpable earth and unattainable sky.Soon finding, however, that either she or the image was unreal,she turned elsewhere for better pastime. She made little boatsout of birch-bark, and freighted them with snail-shells, and sentout more ventures on the mighty deep than any merchant inNew England; but the larger part of them foundered near theshore. She seized a live horseshoe by the tail, and made prizeof several five-fingers, and laid out a jelly-fish to melt in thewarm sun. Then she took up the white foam, that streakedthe line of the advancing tide, and threw it upon the breeze,scampering after it, with winged footsteps, to catch the greatsnow-flakes ere they fell. Perceiving a flock of beach-birds,that fed and fluttered along the shore, the naughty child pickedup her apron full of pebbles, and, creeping from rock to rockafter these small sea-fowl, displayed remarkable dexterity in peltingthem. One little gray bird, with a white breast, Pearl wasalmost sure, had been hit by a pebble, and fluttered away witha broken wing. But then the elf-child sighed, and gave up her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>sport; because it grieved her to have done harm to a little beingthat was as wild as the sea-breeze, or as wild as Pearl herself.</p><p>Her final employment was to gather sea-weed, of variouskinds, and make herself a scarf, or mantle, and a head-dress,and thus assume the aspect of a little mermaid. She inheritedher mother's gift for devising drapery and costume. As the lasttouch to her mermaid's garb, Pearl took some eel-grass, andimitated, as best she could, on her own bosom, the decorationwith which she was so familiar on her mother's. A letter,—theletter A,—but freshly green, instead of scarlet! The childbent her chin upon her breast, and contemplated this device withstrange interest; even as if the one only thing for which shehad been sent into the world was to make out its hidden import.</p><p>“I wonder if mother will ask me what it means?” thoughtPearl.</p><p>Just then, she heard her mother's voice, and flitting along aslightly as one of the little sea-birds, appeared before HesterPrynne, dancing, laughing, and pointing her finger to the ornamentupon her bosom.</p><p>“My little Pearl,” said Hester, after a moment's silence, “thegreen letter, and on thy childish bosom, has no purport. Butdost thou know, my child, what this letter means which thymother is doomed to wear?”</p><p>“Yes, mother,” said the child. “It is the great letter A.Thou hast taught me in the horn-book.”</p><p>Hester looked steadily into her little face; but, though therewas that singular expression which she had so often remarkedin her black eyes, she could not satisfy herself whether Pearlreally attached any meaning to the symbol. She felt a morbiddesire to ascertain the point.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p><p>“Dost thou know, child, wherefore thy mother wears thisletter?”</p><p>“Truly do I!” answered Pearl, looking brightly into hermother's face. “It is for the same reason that the ministerkeeps his hand over his heart!”</p><p>“And what reason is that?” asked Hester, half smiling atthe absurd incongruity of the child's observation; but, on secondthoughts, turning pale. “What has the letter to do with anyheart, save mine?”</p><p>“Nay, mother, I have told all I know,” said Pearl, moreseriously than she was wont to speak. “Ask yonder old manwhom thou hast been talking with! It may be he can tell.But in good earnest now, mother dear, what does this scarletletter mean?—and why dost thou wear it on thy bosom?—andwhy does the minister keep his hand over his heart?”</p><p>She took her mother's hand in both her own, and gazed intoher eyes with an earnestness that was seldom seen in her wildand capricious character. The thought occurred to Hester, thatthe child might really be seeking to approach her with childlikeconfidence, and doing what she could, and as intelligently as sheknew how, to establish a meeting-point of sympathy. It showedPearl in an unwonted aspect. Heretofore, the mother, whileloving her child with the intensity of a sole affection, had schooledherself to hope for little other return than the waywardness ofan April breeze; which spends its time in airy sport, and hasits gusts of inexplicable passion, and is petulant in its best ofmoods, and chills oftener than caresses you, when you take itto your bosom; in requital of which misdemeanors, it will sometimes,of its own vague purpose, kiss your cheek with a kind ofdoubtful tenderness, and play gently with your hair, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>be gone about its other idle business, leaving a dreamy pleasureat your heart. And this, moreover, was a mother's estimate ofthe child's disposition. Any other observer might have seenfew but unamiable traits, and have given them a far darkercoloring. But now the idea came strongly into Hester's mind,that Pearl, with her remarkable precocity and acuteness, mightalready have approached the age when she could be made afriend, and intrusted with as much of her mother's sorrows ascould be imparted, without irreverence either to the parent orthe child. In the little chaos of Pearl's character there mightbe seen emerging—and could have been, from the very first—thesteadfast principles of an unflinching courage,—an uncontrollablewill,—a sturdy pride, which might be disciplined intoself-respect,—and a bitter scorn of many things, which, whenexamined, might be found to have the taint of falsehood in them.She possessed affections, too, though hitherto acrid and disagreeable,as are the richest flavors of unripe fruit. With all thesesterling attributes, thought Hester, the evil which she inheritedfrom her mother must be great indeed, if a noble woman donot grow out of this elfish child.</p><p>Pearl's inevitable tendency to hover about the enigma of thescarlet letter seemed an innate quality of her being. From theearliest epoch of her conscious life, she had entered upon thisas her appointed mission. Hester had often fancied that Providencehad a design of justice and retribution, in endowing thechild with this marked propensity; but never, until now, hadshe bethought herself to ask, whether, linked with that design,there might not likewise be a purpose of mercy and beneficence.If little Pearl were entertained with faith and trust, as a spiritmessenger no less than an earthly child, might it not be her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>errand to soothe away the sorrow that lay cold in her mother'sheart, and converted it into a tomb?—and to help her to overcomethe passion, once so wild, and even yet neither dead norasleep, but only imprisoned within the same tomb-like heart?</p><p>Such were some of the thoughts that now stirred in Hester'smind, with as much vivacity of impression as if they had actuallybeen whispered into her ear. And there was little Pearl, allthis while, holding her mother's hand in both her own, andturning her face upward, while she put these searching questions,once, and again, and still a third time.</p><p>“What does the letter mean, mother?—and why dost thouwear it?—and why does the minister keep his hand over hisheart?”</p><p>“What shall I say?” thought Hester to herself. “No! Ifthis be the price of the child's sympathy, I cannot pay it.”</p><p>Then she spoke aloud.</p><p>“Silly Pearl,” said she, “what questions are these? Thereare many things in this world that a child must not ask about.What know I of the minister's heart? And as for the scarletletter, I wear it for the sake of its gold-thread.”</p><p>In all the seven bygone years, Hester Prynne had neverbefore been false to the symbol on her bosom. It may be thatit was the talisman of a stern and severe, but yet a guardianspirit, who now forsook her; as recognizing that, in spite ofhis strict watch over her heart, some new evil had crept intoit, or some old one had never been expelled. As for littlePearl, the earnestness soon passed out of her face.</p><p>But the child did not see fit to let the matter drop. Twoor three times, as her mother and she went homeward, and asoften at supper-time, and while Hester was putting her to bed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>and once after she seemed to be fairly asleep, Pearl looked up,with mischief gleaming in her black eyes.</p><p>“Mother,” said she, “what does the scarlet letter mean?”</p><p>And the next morning, the first indication the child gave ofbeing awake was by popping up her head from the pillow, andmaking that other inquiry, which she had so unaccountablyconnected with her investigations about the scarlet letter:—</p><p>“Mother!—Mother!—Why does the minister keep his handover his heart?”</p><p>“Hold thy tongue, naughty child!” answered her mother,with an asperity that she had never permitted to herself before.“Do not tease me; else I shall shut thee into the darkcloset!”</p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px; padding-top: 1em"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_222.jpg" width="300" height="221" alt="" title=""></div><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; padding-top: 4em"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/ornament_iv.jpg" width="400" height="111" alt="" title=""></div><h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a>XVI.</h2><h4>A FOREST WALK.</h4><div class="initial"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/initial_h.jpg" alt="H" title="H"></div><p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">ester</span> Prynne remained constant in herresolve to make known to Mr. Dimmesdale,at whatever risk of present pain or ulteriorconsequences, the true character of the manwho had crept into his intimacy. For severaldays, however, she vainly sought an opportunityof addressing him in some of the meditative walks whichshe knew him to be in the habit of taking, along the shores ofthe peninsula, or on the wooded hills of the neighboring country.There would have been no scandal, indeed, nor peril tothe holy whiteness of the clergyman's good fame, had shevisited him in his own study; where many a penitent, ere now,had confessed sins of perhaps as deep a dye as the one betokenedby the scarlet letter. But, partly that she dreaded thesecret or undisguised interference of old Roger Chillingworth,and partly that her conscious heart imputed suspicion wherenone could have been felt, and partly that both the ministerand she would need the whole wide world to breathe in, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>they talked together,—for all these reasons, Hester never thoughtof meeting him in any narrower privacy than beneath the opensky.</p><p>At last, while attending in a sick-chamber, whither the ReverendMr. Dimmesdale had been summoned to make a prayer, shelearnt that he had gone, the day before, to visit the ApostleEliot, among his Indian converts. He would probably return,by a certain hour, in the afternoon of the morrow. Betimes,therefore, the next day, Hester took little Pearl,—who wasnecessarily the companion of all her mother's expeditions, howeverinconvenient her presence,—and set forth.</p><p>The road, after the two wayfarers had crossed from the peninsulato the mainland, was no other than a footpath. It straggledonward into the mystery of the primeval forest. This hemmedit in so narrowly, and stood so black and dense on either side,and disclosed such imperfect glimpses of the sky above, that,to Hester's mind, it imaged not amiss the moral wilderness inwhich she had so long been wandering. The day was chill andsombre. Overhead was a gray expanse of cloud, slightly stirred,however, by a breeze; so that a gleam of flickering sunshinemight now and then be seen at its solitary play along the path.This flitting cheerfulness was always at the farther extremity ofsome long vista through the forest. The sportive sunlight—feeblysportive, at best, in the predominant pensiveness of theday and scene—withdrew itself as they came nigh, and left thespots where it had danced the drearier, because they had hopedto find them bright.</p><p>“Mother,” said little Pearl, “the sunshine does not love you.It runs away and hides itself, because it is afraid of somethingon your bosom. Now, see! There it is, playing, a good way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>off. Stand you here, and let me run and catch it. I am buta child. It will not flee from me; for I wear nothing on mybosom yet!”</p><p>“Nor ever will, my child, I hope,” said Hester.</p><p>“And why not, mother?” asked Pearl, stopping short, justat the beginning of her race. “Will not it come of its ownaccord, when I am a woman grown?”</p><p>“Run away, child,” answered her mother, “and catch thesunshine! It will soon be gone.”</p><p>Pearl set forth, at a great pace, and, as Hester smiled to perceive,did actually catch the sunshine, and stood laughing in themidst of it, all brightened by its splendor, and scintillating withthe vivacity excited by rapid motion. The light lingered aboutthe lonely child, as if glad of such a playmate, until her motherhad drawn almost nigh enough to step into the magic circle too.</p><p>“It will go now,” said Pearl, shaking her head.</p><p>“See!” answered Hester, smiling. “Now I can stretch outmy hand, and grasp some of it.”</p><p>As she attempted to do so, the sunshine vanished; or, tojudge from the bright expression that was dancing on Pearl'sfeatures, her mother could have fancied that the child hadabsorbed it into herself, and would give it forth again, with agleam about her path, as they should plunge into some gloomiershade. There was no other attribute that so much impressedher with a sense of new and untransmitted vigor in Pearl'snature, as this never-failing vivacity of spirits; she had not thedisease of sadness, which almost all children, in these latter days,inherit, with the scrofula, from the troubles of their ancestors.Perhaps this too was a disease, and but the reflex of the wildenergy with which Hester had fought against her sorrows, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>Pearl's birth. It was certainly a doubtful charm, imparting ahard, metallic lustre to the child's character. She wanted—whatsome people want throughout life—a grief that shoulddeeply touch her, and thus humanize and make her capable ofsympathy. But there was time enough yet for little Pearl.</p><p>“Come, my child!” said Hester, looking about her from thespot where Pearl had stood still in the sunshine. “We will sitdown a little way within the wood, and rest ourselves.”</p><p>“I am not aweary, mother,” replied the little girl. “Butyou may sit down, if you will tell me a story meanwhile.”</p><p>“A story, child!” said Hester. “And about what?”</p><p>“O, a story about the Black Man,” answered Pearl, takinghold of her mother's gown, and looking up, half earnestly, halfmischievously, into her face. “How he haunts this forest, andcarries a book with him,—a big, heavy book, with iron clasps;and how this ugly Black Man offers his book and an iron pento everybody that meets him here among the trees; and theyare to write their names with their own blood. And then hesets his mark on their bosoms! Didst thou ever meet theBlack Man, mother?”</p><p>“And who told you this story, Pearl?” asked her mother,recognizing a common superstition of the period.</p><p>“It was the old dame in the chimney-corner, at the housewhere you watched last night,” said the child. “But she fanciedme asleep while she was talking of it. She said that a thousandand a thousand people had met him here, and had written inhis book, and have his mark on them. And that ugly-temperedlady, old Mistress Hibbins, was one. And, mother, the olddame said that this scarlet letter was the Black Man's mark onthee, and that it glows like a red flame when thou meetest him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>at midnight, here in the dark wood. Is it true, mother? Anddost thou go to meet him in the night-time?”</p><p>“Didst thou ever awake, and find thy mother gone?” askedHester.</p><p>“Not that I remember,” said the child. “If thou fearest toleave me in our cottage, thou mightest take me along with thee.I would very gladly go! But, mother, tell me now! Is theresuch a Black Man? And didst thou ever meet him? And isthis his mark?”</p><p>“Wilt thou let me be at peace, if I once tell thee?” askedher mother.</p><p>“Yes, if thou tellest me all,” answered Pearl.</p><p>“Once in my life I met the Black Man!” said her mother.“This scarlet letter is his mark!”</p><p>Thus conversing, they entered sufficiently deep into the woodto secure themselves from the observation of any casual passengeralong the forest track. Here they sat down on a luxuriantheap of moss; which, at some epoch of the precedingcentury, had been a gigantic pine, with its roots and trunk inthe darksome shade, and its head aloft in the upper atmosphere.It was a little dell where they had seated themselves, with aleaf-strewn bank rising gently on either side, and a brook flowingthrough the midst, over a bed of fallen and drowned leaves.The trees impending over it had flung down great branches,from time to time, which choked up the current and compelledit to form eddies and black depths at some points; while, in itsswifter and livelier passages, there appeared a channel-way ofpebbles, and brown, sparkling sand. Letting the eyes followalong the course of the stream, they could catch the reflectedlight from its water, at some short distance within the forest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>but soon lost all traces of it amid the bewilderment of tree-trunksand underbrush, and here and there a huge rock coveredover with gray lichens. All these giant trees and bowlders ofgranite seemed intent on making a mystery of the course of thissmall brook; fearing, perhaps, that, with its never-ceasing loquacity,it should whisper tales out of the heart of the old forestwhence it flowed, or mirror its revelations on the smooth surfaceof a pool. Continually, indeed, as it stole onward, the streamletkept up a babble, kind, quiet, soothing, but melancholy, likethe voice of a young child that was spending its infancy withoutplayfulness, and knew not how to be merry among sadacquaintance and events of sombre hue.</p><p>“O brook! O foolish and tiresome little brook!” criedPearl, after listening awhile to its talk. “Why art thou sosad? Pluck up a spirit, and do not be all the time sighingand murmuring!”</p><p>But the brook, in the course of its little lifetime among theforest-trees, had gone through so solemn an experience that itcould not help talking about it, and seemed to have nothingelse to say. Pearl resembled the brook, inasmuch as the currentof her life gushed from a well-spring as mysterious, andhad flowed through scenes shadowed as heavily with gloom.But, unlike the little stream, she danced and sparkled, and prattledairily along her course.</p><p>“What does this sad little brook say, mother?” inquired she.</p><p>“If thou hadst a sorrow of thine own, the brook might tell theeof it,” answered her mother, “even as it is telling me of mine!But now, Pearl, I hear a footstep along the path, and the noise ofone putting aside the branches. I would have thee betake thyselfto play, and leave me to speak with him that comes yonder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>”</p><p>“Is it the Black Man?” asked Pearl.</p><p>“Wilt thou go and play, child?” repeated her mother.“But do not stray far into the wood. And take heed thatthou come at my first call.”</p><p>“Yes, mother,” answered Pearl. “But if it be the BlackMan, wilt thou not let me stay a moment, and look at him,with his big book under his arm?”</p><p>“Go, silly child!” said her mother, impatiently. “It is noBlack Man! Thou canst see him now, through the trees. Itis the minister!”</p><p>“And so it is!” said the child. “And, mother, he has hishand over his heart! Is it because, when the minister wrotehis name in the book, the Black Man set his mark in that place?But why does he not wear it outside his bosom, as thou dost,mother?”</p><p>“Go now, child, and thou shalt tease me as thou wilt anothertime,” cried Hester Prynne. “But do not stray far. Keepwhere thou canst hear the babble of the brook.”</p><p>The child went singing away, following up the current of thebrook, and striving to mingle a more lightsome cadence withits melancholy voice. But the little stream would not be comforted,and still kept telling its unintelligible secret of somevery mournful mystery that had happened—or making a propheticlamentation about something that was yet to happen—withinthe verge of the dismal forest. So Pearl, who had enoughof shadow in her own little life, chose to break off all acquaintancewith this repining brook. She set herself, therefore, togathering violets and wood-anemones, and some scarlet columbinesthat she found growing in the crevices of a high rock.</p><p>When her elf-child had departed, Hester Prynne made a step<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>or two towards the track that led through the forest, but stillremained under the deep shadow of the trees. She beheld theminister advancing along the path, entirely alone, and leaningon a staff which he had cut by the wayside. He looked haggardand feeble, and betrayed a nerveless despondency in his air,which had never so remarkably characterized him in his walksabout the settlement, nor in any other situation where he deemedhimself liable to notice. Here it was wofully visible, in thisintense seclusion of the forest, which of itself would have beena heavy trial to the spirits. There was a listlessness in hisgait; as if he saw no reason for taking one step farther, norfelt any desire to do so, but would have been glad, could hebe glad of anything, to fling himself down at the root of thenearest tree, and lie there passive, forevermore. The leaves mightbestrew him, and the soil gradually accumulate and form a littlehillock over his frame, no matter whether there were life init or no. Death was too definite an object to be wished for,or avoided.</p><p>To Hester's eye, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale exhibited nosymptom of positive and vivacious suffering, except that, as littlePearl had remarked, he kept his hand over his heart.</p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px; padding-top: 1em"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_230.jpg" width="300" height="131" alt="" title=""></div><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; padding-top: 4em"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/ornament_v.jpg" width="400" height="110" alt="" title=""></div><h2><a name="XVII" id="XVII"></a>XVII.</h2><h4>THE PASTOR AND HIS PARISHIONER.</h4><div class="initial"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/initial_s.jpg" alt="S" title="S"></div><p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">lowly</span> as the minister walked, he had almostgone by, before Hester Prynne could gathervoice enough to attract his observation. Atlength, she succeeded.</p><p>“Arthur Dimmesdale!” she said, faintlyat first; then louder, but hoarsely. “ArthurDimmesdale!”</p><p>“Who speaks?” answered the minister.</p><p>Gathering himself quickly up, he stood more erect, like a mantaken by surprise in a mood to which he was reluctant to havewitnesses. Throwing his eyes anxiously in the direction of thevoice, he indistinctly beheld a form under the trees, clad ingarments so sombre, and so little relieved from the gray twilightinto which the clouded sky and the heavy foliage had darkenedthe noontide, that he knew not whether it were a woman or ashadow. It may be, that his pathway through life was hauntedthus, by a spectre that had stolen out from among his thoughts.</p><p>He made a step nigher, and discovered the scarlet letter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p><p>“Hester! Hester Prynne!” said he. “Is it thou? Art thouin life?”</p><p>“Even so!” she answered. “In such life as has been minethese seven years past! And thou, Arthur Dimmesdale, dostthou yet live?”</p><p>It was no wonder that they thus questioned one another'sactual and bodily existence, and even doubted of their own. Sostrangely did they meet, in the dim wood, that it was like thefirst encounter, in the world beyond the grave, of two spiritswho had been intimately connected in their former life, but nowstood coldly shuddering, in mutual dread; as not yet familiarwith their state, nor wonted to the companionship of disembodiedbeings. Each a ghost, and awe-stricken at the other ghost!They were awe-stricken likewise at themselves; because the crisisflung back to them their consciousness, and revealed to eachheart its history and experience, as life never does, except atsuch breathless epochs. The soul beheld its features in themirror of the passing moment. It was with fear, and tremulously,and, as it were, by a slow, reluctant necessity, thatArthur Dimmesdale put forth his hand, chill as death, andtouched the chill hand of Hester Prynne. The grasp, cold asit was, took away what was dreariest in the interview. Theynow felt themselves, at least, inhabitants of the same sphere.</p><p>Without a word more spoken,—neither he nor she assumingthe guidance, but with an unexpressed consent,—they glidedback into the shadow of the woods, whence Hester had emerged,and sat down on the heap of moss where she and Pearl hadbefore been sitting. When they found voice to speak, it was,at first, only to utter remarks and inquiries such as any twoacquaintance might have made, about the gloomy sky, the threatening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>storm, and, next, the health of each. Thus they wentonward, not boldly, but step by step, into the themes that werebrooding deepest in their hearts. So long estranged by fate andcircumstances, they needed something slight and casual to runbefore, and throw open the doors of intercourse, so that theirreal thoughts might be led across the threshold.</p><p>After a while, the minister fixed his eyes on Hester Prynne's.</p><p>“Hester,” said he, “hast thou found peace?”</p><p>She smiled drearily, looking down upon her bosom.</p><p>“Hast thou?” she asked.</p><p>“None!—nothing but despair!” he answered. “What elsecould I look for, being what I am, and leading such a life asmine? Were I an atheist,—a man devoid of conscience,—awretch with coarse and brutal instincts,—I might have foundpeace, long ere now. Nay, I never should have lost it! But,as matters stand with my soul, whatever of good capacity thereoriginally was in me, all of God's gifts that were the choicesthave become the ministers of spiritual torment. Hester, I ammost miserable!”</p><p>“The people reverence thee,” said Hester. “And surely thouworkest good among them! Doth this bring thee no comfort?”</p><p>“More misery, Hester!—only the more misery!” answeredthe clergyman, with a bitter smile. “As concerns the good which Imay appear to do, I have no faith in it. It must needs be adelusion. What can a ruined soul, like mine, effect towards theredemption of other souls?—or a polluted soul towards theirpurification? And as for the people's reverence, would thatit were turned to scorn and hatred! Canst thou deem it,Hester, a consolation, that I must stand up in my pulpit, andmeet so many eyes turned upward to my face, as if the light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>of heaven were beaming from it!—must see my flock hungryfor the truth, and listening to my words as if a tongue ofPentecost were speaking!—and then look inward, and discernthe black reality of what they idolize? I have laughed, in bitternessand agony of heart, at the contrast between what I seemand what I am! And Satan laughs at it!”</p><p>“You wrong yourself in this,” said Hester, gently. “Youhave deeply and sorely repented. Your sin is left behind you,in the days long past. Your present life is not less holy, invery truth, than it seems in people's eyes. Is there no realityin the penitence thus sealed and witnessed by good works? Andwherefore should it not bring you peace?”</p><p>“No, Hester, no!” replied the clergyman. “There is nosubstance in it! It is cold and dead, and can do nothing forme! Of penance, I have had enough! Of penitence, there hasbeen none! Else, I should long ago have thrown off thesegarments of mock holiness, and have shown myself to mankindas they will see me at the judgment-seat. Happy are you,Hester, that wear the scarlet letter openly upon your bosom!Mine burns in secret! Thou little knowest what a relief it is,after the torment of a seven years' cheat, to look into an eyethat recognizes me for what I am! Had I one friend,—orwere it my worst enemy!—to whom, when sickened with thepraises of all other men, I could daily betake myself, and beknown as the vilest of all sinners, methinks my soul might keepitself alive thereby. Even thus much of truth would save me!But, now, it is all falsehood!—all emptiness!—all death!”</p><p>Hester Prynne looked into his face, but hesitated to speak.Yet, uttering his long-restrained emotions so vehemently as hedid, his words here offered her the very point of circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>in which to interpose what she came to say. She conqueredher fears, and spoke.</p><p>“Such a friend as thou hast even now wished for,” said she,“with whom to weep over thy sin, thou hast in me, the partnerof it!”—Again she hesitated, but brought out the words withan effort.—“Thou hast long had such an enemy, and dwellestwith him, under the same roof!”</p><p>The minister started to his feet, gasping for breath, and clutchingat his heart, as if he would have torn it out of his bosom.</p><p>“Ha! What sayest thou!” cried he. “An enemy! Andunder mine own roof! What mean you?”</p><p>Hester Prynne was now fully sensible of the deep injury forwhich she was responsible to this unhappy man, in permittinghim to lie for so many years, or, indeed, for a single moment,at the mercy of one whose purposes could not be other thanmalevolent. The very contiguity of his enemy, beneath whatevermask the latter might conceal himself, was enough to disturbthe magnetic sphere of a being so sensitive as ArthurDimmesdale. There had been a period when Hester was lessalive to this consideration; or, perhaps, in the misanthropy ofher own trouble, she left the minister to bear what she mightpicture to herself as a more tolerable doom. But of late, sincethe night of his vigil, all her sympathies towards him had beenboth softened and invigorated. She now read his heart moreaccurately. She doubted not, that the continual presence of RogerChillingworth,—the secret poison of his malignity, infecting allthe air about him,—and his authorized interference, as a physician,with the minister's physical and spiritual infirmities,—thatthese bad opportunities had been turned to a cruel purpose.By means of them, the sufferer's conscience had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>kept in an irritated state, the tendency of which was, not tocure by wholesome pain, but to disorganize and corrupt hisspiritual being. Its result, on earth, could hardly fail to beinsanity, and hereafter, that eternal alienation from the Goodand True, of which madness is perhaps the earthly type.</p><p>Such was the ruin to which she had brought the man, once,—nay,why should we not speak it?—still so passionately loved!Hester felt that the sacrifice of the clergyman's good name, anddeath itself, as she had already told Roger Chillingworth,would have been infinitely preferable to the alternative whichshe had taken upon herself to choose. And now, rather than havehad this grievous wrong to confess, she would gladly have laindown on the forest-leaves, and died there, at Arthur Dimmesdale'sfeet.</p><p>“O Arthur,” cried she, “forgive me! In all things else,I have striven to be true! Truth was the one virtue which Imight have held fast, and did hold fast, through all extremity;save when thy good,—thy life,—thy fame,—were put in question!Then I consented to a deception. But a lie is nevergood, even though death threaten on the other side! Dost thounot see what I would say? That old man!—the physician!—hewhom they call Roger Chillingworth!—he was my husband!”</p><p class="figcenter"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25344/25344-h/images/illu_237.jpg"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_237_th.jpg" alt="Wilt thou yet forgive me?" title="Wilt thou yet forgive me?"></a></p><p>The minister looked at her, for an instant, with all that violenceof passion, which—intermixed, in more shapes than one,with his higher, purer, softer qualities—was, in fact, the portionof him which the Devil claimed, and through which he sought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>to win the rest. Never was there a blacker or a fiercer frownthan Hester now encountered. For the brief space that it lasted,it was a dark transfiguration. But his character had been so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>much enfeebled by suffering, that even its lower energies wereincapable of more than a temporary struggle. He sank downon the ground, and buried his face in his hands.</p><p>“I might have known it,” murmured he. “I did know it!Was not the secret told me, in the natural recoil of my heart,at the first sight of him, and as often as I have seen him since?Why did I not understand? O Hester Prynne, thou little,little knowest all the horror of this thing! And the shame!—theindelicacy!—the horrible ugliness of this exposure of a sickand guilty heart to the very eye that would gloat over it!Woman, woman, thou art accountable for this! I cannot forgivethee!”</p><p>“Thou shalt forgive me!” cried Hester, flinging herself onthe fallen leaves beside him. “Let God punish! Thou shaltforgive!”</p><p>With sudden and desperate tenderness, she threw her armsaround him, and pressed his head against her bosom; littlecaring though his cheek rested on the scarlet letter. He wouldhave released himself, but strove in vain to do so. Hester wouldnot set him free, lest he should look her sternly in the face.All the world had frowned on her,—for seven long years hadit frowned upon this lonely woman,—and still she bore it all,nor ever once turned away her firm, sad eyes. Heaven, likewise,had frowned upon her, and she had not died. But the frownof this pale, weak, sinful, and sorrow-stricken man was whatHester could not bear and live!</p><p>“Wilt thou yet forgive me?” she repeated, over and overagain. “Wilt thou not frown? Wilt thou forgive?”</p><p>“I do forgive you, Hester,” replied the minister, at length,with a deep utterance, out of an abyss of sadness, but no anger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>“I freely forgive you now. May God forgive us both! Weare not, Hester, the worst sinners in the world. There is oneworse than even the polluted priest! That old man's revenge hasbeen blacker than my sin. He has violated, in cold blood, thesanctity of a human heart. Thou and I, Hester, never did so!”</p><p>“Never, never!” whispered she. “What we did had aconsecration of its own. We felt it so! We said so to eachother! Hast thou forgotten it?”</p><p>“Hush, Hester!” said Arthur Dimmesdale, rising from theground. “No; I have not forgotten!”</p><p>They sat down again, side by side, and hand clasped in hand,on the mossy trunk of the fallen tree. Life had never broughtthem a gloomier hour; it was the point whither their pathwayhad so long been tending, and darkening ever, as it stole along;—andyet it enclosed a charm that made them linger upon it,and claim another, and another, and, after all, another moment.The forest was obscure around them, and creaked with a blastthat was passing through it. The boughs were tossing heavilyabove their heads; while one solemn old tree groaned dolefullyto another, as if telling the sad story of the pair that satbeneath, or constrained to forebode evil to come.</p><p>And yet they lingered. How dreary looked the forest-trackthat led backward to the settlement, where Hester Prynne musttake up again the burden of her ignominy, and the minister thehollow mockery of his good name! So they lingered an instantlonger. No golden light had ever been so precious as the gloomof this dark forest. Here, seen only by his eyes, the scarletletter need not burn into the bosom of the fallen woman!Here, seen only by her eyes, Arthur Dimmesdale, false to Godand man, might be, for one moment, true!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p><p>He started at a thought that suddenly occurred to him.</p><p>“Hester,” cried he, “here is a new horror! Roger Chillingworthknows your purpose to reveal his true character. Willhe continue, then, to keep our secret? What will now be thecourse of his revenge?”</p><p>“There is a strange secrecy in his nature,” replied Hester,thoughtfully; “and it has grown upon him by the hidden practicesof his revenge. I deem it not likely that he will betraythe secret. He will doubtless seek other means of satiating hisdark passion.”</p><p>“And I!—how am I to live longer, breathing the sameair with this deadly enemy?” exclaimed Arthur Dimmesdale,shrinking within himself, and pressing his hand nervously againsthis heart,—a gesture that had grown involuntary with him.</p><p>“Think for me, Hester! Thou art strong. Resolve for me!”</p><p>“Thou must dwell no longer with this man,” said Hester,slowly and firmly. “Thy heart must be no longer under hisevil eye!”</p><p>“It were far worse than death!” replied the minister. “Buthow to avoid it? What choice remains to me? Shall I liedown again on these withered leaves, where I cast myself whenthou didst tell me what he was? Must I sink down there, anddie at once?”</p><p>“Alas, what a ruin has befallen thee!” said Hester, with thetears gushing into her eyes. “Wilt thou die for very weakness?There is no other cause!”</p><p>“The judgment of God is on me,” answered the conscience-strickenpriest. “It is too mighty for me to struggle with!”</p><p>“Heaven would show mercy,” rejoined Hester, “hadst thoubut the strength to take advantage of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>”</p><p>“Be thou strong for me!” answered he. “Advise me whatto do.”</p><p>“Is the world, then, so narrow?” exclaimed Hester Prynne,fixing her deep eyes on the minister's, and instinctively exercisinga magnetic power over a spirit so shattered and subduedthat it could hardly hold itself erect. “Doth the universe liewithin the compass of yonder town, which only a little timeago was but a leaf-strewn desert, as lonely as this around us?Whither leads yonder forest-track? Backward to the settlement,thou sayest! Yes; but onward, too. Deeper it goes, anddeeper, into the wilderness, less plainly to be seen at every step;until, some few miles hence, the yellow leaves will show novestige of the white man's tread. There thou art free! Sobrief a journey would bring thee from a world where thou hastbeen most wretched, to one where thou mayest still be happy!Is there not shade enough in all this boundless forest to hidethy heart from the gaze of Roger Chillingworth?”</p><p>“Yes, Hester; but only under the fallen leaves!” replied theminister, with a sad smile.</p><p>“Then there is the broad pathway of the sea!” continuedHester. “It brought thee hither. If thou so choose, it willbear thee back again. In our native land, whether in someremote rural village or in vast London,—or, surely, in Germany,in France, in pleasant Italy,—thou wouldst be beyond his powerand knowledge! And what hast thou to do with all these ironmen, and their opinions? They have kept thy better part inbondage too long already!”</p><p>“It cannot be!” answered the minister, listening as if hewere called upon to realize a dream. “I am powerless to go!Wretched and sinful as I am, I have had no other thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>than to drag on my earthly existence in the sphere where Providencehath placed me. Lost as my own soul is, I would stilldo what I may for other human souls! I dare not quit mypost, though an unfaithful sentinel, whose sure reward is deathand dishonor, when his dreary watch shall come to an end!”</p><p>“Thou art crushed under this seven years' weight of misery,”replied Hester, fervently resolved to buoy him up with her ownenergy. “But thou shalt leave it all behind thee! It shall notcumber thy steps, as thou treadest along the forest-path; neithershalt thou freight the ship with it, if thou prefer to cross thesea. Leave this wreck and ruin here where it hath happened.Meddle no more with it! Begin all anew! Hast thou exhaustedpossibility in the failure of this one trial? Not so! The futureis yet full of trial and success. There is happiness to be enjoyed!There is good to be done! Exchange this false life of thine fora true one. Be, if thy spirit summon thee to such a mission,the teacher and apostle of the red men. Or,—as is more thynature,—be a scholar and a sage among the wisest and themost renowned of the cultivated world. Preach! Write! Act!Do anything, save to lie down and die! Give up this name ofArthur Dimmesdale, and make thyself another, and a high one,such as thou canst wear without fear or shame. Why shouldstthou tarry so much as one other day in the torments that haveso gnawed into thy life!—that have made thee feeble to willand to do!—that will leave thee powerless even to repent!Up, and away!”</p><p>“O Hester!” cried Arthur Dimmesdale, in whose eyes a fitfullight, kindled by her enthusiasm, flashed up and died away,“thou tellest of running a race to a man whose knees are totteringbeneath him! I must die here! There is not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>strength or courage left me to venture into the wide, strange,difficult world, alone!”</p><p>It was the last expression of the despondency of a brokenspirit. He lacked energy to grasp the better fortune that seemedwithin his reach.</p><p>He repeated the word.</p><p>“Alone, Hester!”</p><p>“Thou shalt not go alone!” answered she, in a deep whisper.</p><p>Then, all was spoken!</p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px; padding-top: 1em"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_053.jpg" width="300" height="217" alt="" title=""></div><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; padding-top: 4em"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/ornament_iii.jpg" width="400" height="111" alt="" title=""></div><h2><a name="XVIII" id="XVIII"></a>XVIII.</h2><h4>A FLOOD OF SUNSHINE.</h4><div class="initial"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/initial_a.jpg" alt="A" title="A"></div><p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">rthur</span> Dimmesdale gazed into Hester'sface with a look in which hope and joyshone out, indeed, but with fear betwixtthem, and a kind of horror at her boldness,who had spoken what he vaguely hinted at,but dared not speak.</p><p>But Hester Prynne, with a mind of native courage and activity,and for so long a period not merely estranged, but outlawed,from society, had habituated herself to such latitude of speculationas was altogether foreign to the clergyman. She had wandered,without rule or guidance, in a moral wilderness; as vast, as intricateand shadowy, as the untamed forest, amid the gloom ofwhich they were now holding a colloquy that was to decidetheir fate. Her intellect and heart had their home, as it were,in desert places, where she roamed as freely as the wild Indianin his woods. For years past she had looked from this estrangedpoint of view at human institutions, and whatever priests or legislatorshad established; criticising all with hardly more reverence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>than the Indian would feel for the clerical band, the judicialrobe, the pillory, the gallows, the fireside, or the church. Thetendency of her fate and fortunes had been to set her free. Thescarlet letter was her passport into regions where other womendared not tread. Shame, Despair, Solitude! These had beenher teachers,—stern and wild ones,—and they had made herstrong, but taught her much amiss.</p><p>The minister, on the other hand, had never gone through anexperience calculated to lead him beyond the scope of generallyreceived laws; although, in a single instance, he had so fearfullytransgressed one of the most sacred of them. But thishad been a sin of passion, not of principle, nor even purpose.Since that wretched epoch, he had watched, with morbid zealand minuteness, not his acts,—for those it was easy to arrange,—buteach breath of emotion, and his every thought. At thehead of the social system, as the clergymen of that day stood,he was only the more trammelled by its regulations, its principles,and even its prejudices. As a priest, the framework ofhis order inevitably hemmed him in. As a man who had oncesinned, but who kept his conscience all alive and painfully sensitiveby the fretting of an unhealed wound, he might have beensupposed safer within the line of virtue than if he had neversinned at all.</p><p>Thus, we seem to see that, as regarded Hester Prynne, thewhole seven years of outlaw and ignominy had been little otherthan a preparation for this very hour. But Arthur Dimmesdale!Were such a man once more to fall, what plea couldbe urged in extenuation of his crime? None; unless it availhim somewhat, that he was broken down by long and exquisitesuffering; that his mind was darkened and confused by the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>remorse which harrowed it; that, between fleeing as an avowedcriminal, and remaining as a hypocrite, conscience might findit hard to strike the balance; that it was human to avoid theperil of death and infamy, and the inscrutable machinations ofan enemy; that, finally, to this poor pilgrim, on his dreary anddesert path, faint, sick, miserable, there appeared a glimpse ofhuman affection and sympathy, a new life, and a true one, inexchange for the heavy doom which he was now expiating. Andbe the stern and sad truth spoken, that the breach which guilthas once made into the human soul is never, in this mortalstate, repaired. It may be watched and guarded; so that theenemy shall not force his way again into the citadel, and mighteven, in his subsequent assaults, select some other avenue, inpreference to that where he had formerly succeeded. But thereis still the ruined wall, and, near it, the stealthy tread of thefoe that would win over again his unforgotten triumph.</p><p>The struggle, if there were one, need not be described. Letit suffice, that the clergyman resolved to flee, and not alone.</p><p>“If, in all these past seven years,” thought he, “I couldrecall one instant of peace or hope, I would yet endure, for thesake of that earnest of Heaven's mercy. But now,—since Iam irrevocably doomed,—wherefore should I not snatch thesolace allowed to the condemned culprit before his execution?Or, if this be the path to a better life, as Hester would persuademe, I surely give up no fairer prospect by pursuing it!Neither can I any longer live without her companionship; sopowerful is she to sustain,—so tender to soothe! O Thou towhom I dare not lift mine eyes, wilt Thou yet pardon me!”</p><p>“Thou wilt go!” said Hester, calmly, as he met her glance.</p><p>The decision once made, a glow of strange enjoyment threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>its flickering brightness over the trouble of his breast. It wasthe exhilarating effect—upon a prisoner just escaped from thedungeon of his own heart—of breathing the wild, free atmosphereof an unredeemed, unchristianized, lawless region. Hisspirit rose, as it were, with a bound, and attained a nearer prospectof the sky, than throughout all the misery which had kepthim grovelling on the earth. Of a deeply religious temperament,there was inevitably a tinge of the devotional in hismood.</p><p>“Do I feel joy again?” cried he, wondering at himself.“Methought the germ of it was dead in me! O Hester, thouart my better angel! I seem to have flung myself—sick, sin-stained,and sorrow-blackened—down upon these forest-leaves,and to have risen up all made anew, and with new powers toglorify Him that hath been merciful! This is already the betterlife! Why did we not find it sooner?”</p><p>“Let us not look back,” answered Hester Prynne. “Thepast is gone! Wherefore should we linger upon it now? See!With this symbol, I undo it all, and make it as it had neverbeen!”</p><p>So speaking, she undid the clasp that fastened the scarlet letter,and, taking it from her bosom, threw it to a distance among thewithered leaves. The mystic token alighted on the hither vergeof the stream. With a hand's breadth farther flight it wouldhave fallen into the water, and have given the little brookanother woe to carry onward, besides the unintelligible tale whichit still kept murmuring about. But there lay the embroideredletter, glittering like a lost jewel, which some ill-fated wanderermight pick up, and thenceforth be haunted by strange phantomsof guilt, sinkings of the heart, and unaccountable misfortune.</p><p class="figcenter"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25344/25344-h/images/illu_249.jpg"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_249_th.jpg" alt="A Gleam of Sunshine" title="A Gleam of Sunshine"></a></p><p>The stigma gone, Hester heaved a long, deep sigh, in whichthe burden of shame and anguish departed from her spirit. Oexquisite relief! She had not known the weight, until she feltthe freedom! By another impulse, she took off the formal capthat confined her hair; and down it fell upon her shoulders,dark and rich, with at once a shadow and a light in its abundance,and imparting the charm of softness to her features. Thereplayed around her mouth, and beamed out of her eyes, a radiantand tender smile, that seemed gushing from the very heart of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>womanhood. A crimson flush was glowing on her cheek, thathad been long so pale. Her sex, her youth, and the whole richnessof her beauty, came back from what men call the irrevocablepast, and clustered themselves, with her maiden hope, and ahappiness before unknown, within the magic circle of this hour.And, as if the gloom of the earth and sky had been but theeffluence of these two mortal hearts, it vanished with their sorrow.All at once, as with a sudden smile of heaven, forth burst thesunshine, pouring a very flood into the obscure forest, gladdeningeach green leaf, transmuting the yellow fallen ones to gold, andgleaming adown the gray trunks of the solemn trees. The objectsthat had made a shadow hitherto, embodied the brightness now.The course of the little brook might be traced by its merry gleamafar into the wood's heart of mystery, which had become a mysteryof joy.</p><p>Such was the sympathy of Nature—that wild, heathen Natureof the forest, never subjugated by human law, nor illumined byhigher truth—with the bliss of these two spirits! Love, whethernewly born, or aroused from a death-like slumber, must alwayscreate a sunshine, filling the heart so full of radiance, that itoverflows upon the outward world. Had the forest still keptits gloom, it would have been bright in Hester's eyes, andbright in Arthur Dimmesdale's!</p><p>Hester looked at him with the thrill of another joy.</p><p>“Thou must know Pearl!” said she. “Our little Pearl!Thou hast seen her,—yes, I know it!—but thou wilt see hernow with other eyes. She is a strange child! I hardly comprehendher! But thou wilt love her dearly, as I do, and wiltadvise me how to deal with her.”</p><p>“Dost thou think the child will be glad to know me?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>”asked the minister, somewhat uneasily. “I have long shrunkfrom children, because they often show a distrust,—a backwardnessto be familiar with me. I have even been afraid oflittle Pearl!”</p><p>“Ah, that was sad!” answered the mother. “But she willlove thee dearly, and thou her. She is not far off. I will callher! Pearl! Pearl!”</p><p>“I see the child,” observed the minister. “Yonder she is,standing in a streak of sunshine, a good way off, on the otherside of the brook. So thou thinkest the child will love me?”</p><p>Hester smiled, and again called to Pearl, who was visible, atsome distance, as the minister had described her, like a bright-apparelledvision, in a sunbeam, which fell down upon herthrough an arch of boughs. The ray quivered to and fro, makingher figure dim or distinct,—now like a real child, now likea child's spirit,—as the splendor went and came again. Sheheard her mother's voice, and approached slowly through theforest.</p><p>Pearl had not found the hour pass wearisomely, while hermother sat talking with the clergyman. The great black forest—sternas it showed itself to those who brought the guilt andtroubles of the world into its bosom—became the playmate ofthe lonely infant, as well as it knew how. Sombre as it was,it put on the kindest of its moods to welcome her. It offeredher the partridge-berries, the growth of the preceding autumn,but ripening only in the spring, and now red as drops of bloodupon the withered leaves. These Pearl gathered, and was pleasedwith their wild flavor. The small denizens of the wildernesshardly took pains to move out of her path. A partridge, indeed,with a brood of ten behind her, ran forward threateningly, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>soon repented of her fierceness, and clucked to her young onesnot to be afraid. A pigeon, alone on a low branch, allowedPearl to come beneath, and uttered a sound as much of greetingas alarm. A squirrel, from the lofty depths of his domestictree, chattered either in anger or merriment,—for a squirrel issuch a choleric and humorous little personage, that it is hard todistinguish between his moods,—so he chattered at the child, andflung down a nut upon her head. It was a last year's nut,and already gnawed by his sharp tooth. A fox, startled fromhis sleep by her light footstep on the leaves, looked inquisitivelyat Pearl, as doubting whether it were better to steal off, orrenew his nap on the same spot. A wolf, it is said,—but herethe tale has surely lapsed into the improbable,—came up, andsmelt of Pearl's robe, and offered his savage head to be pattedby her hand. The truth seems to be, however, that the mother-forest,and these wild things which it nourished, all recognizeda kindred wildness in the human child.</p><p>And she was gentler here than in the grassy-margined streetsof the settlement, or in her mother's cottage. The flowersappeared to know it; and one and another whispered as shepassed, “Adorn thyself with me, thou beautiful child, adornthyself with me!”—and, to please them, Pearl gathered theviolets, and anemones, and columbines, and some twigs of thefreshest green, which the old trees held down before her eyes.With these she decorated her hair, and her young waist, andbecame a nymph-child, or an infant dryad, or whatever else wasin closest sympathy with the antique wood. In such guise hadPearl adorned herself, when she heard her mother's voice, andcame slowly back.</p><p>Slowly; for she saw the clergyman.</p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; padding-top: 4em"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/ornament_vii.jpg" width="400" height="109" alt="" title=""></div><h2><a name="XIX" id="XIX"></a>XIX.</h2><h4>THE CHILD AT THE BROOK-SIDE.</h4><div class="initial"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/initial_t.jpg" alt="T" title="T"></div><p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">hou</span> wilt love her dearly,” repeated HesterPrynne, as she and the minister sat watchinglittle Pearl. “Dost thou not think herbeautiful? And see with what naturalskill she has made those simple flowersadorn her! Had she gathered pearls, anddiamonds, and rubies, in the wood, they could not have becomeher better. She is a splendid child! But I know whose browshe has!”</p><p>“Dost thou know, Hester,” said Arthur Dimmesdale, withan unquiet smile, “that this dear child, tripping about alwaysat thy side, hath caused me many an alarm? Methought—OHester, what a thought is that, and how terrible to dread it!—thatmy own features were partly repeated in her face, and sostrikingly that the world might see them! But she is mostlythine!”</p><p>“No, no! Not mostly!” answered the mother, with a tendersmile. “A little longer, and thou needest not to be afraidto trace whose child she is. But how strangely beautiful she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>looks, with those wild-flowers in her hair! It is as if one ofthe fairies, whom we left in our dear old England, had deckedher out to meet us.”</p><p>It was with a feeling which neither of them had ever beforeexperienced, that they sat and watched Pearl's slow advance.In her was visible the tie that united them. She had beenoffered to the world, these seven years past, as the living hieroglyphic,in which was revealed the secret they so darkly soughtto hide,—all written in this symbol,—all plainly manifest,—hadthere been a prophet or magician skilled to read the characterof flame! And Pearl was the oneness of their being. Bethe foregone evil what it might, how could they doubt thattheir earthly lives and future destinies were conjoined, whenthey beheld at once the material union, and the spiritual idea,in whom they met, and were to dwell immortally together?Thoughts like these—and perhaps other thoughts, which theydid not acknowledge or define—threw an awe about the child,as she came onward.</p><p>“Let her see nothing strange—no passion nor eagerness—inthy way of accosting her,” whispered Hester. “Our Pearlis a fitful and fantastic little elf, sometimes. Especially, she isseldom tolerant of emotion, when she does not fully comprehendthe why and wherefore. But the child hath strong affections!She loves me, and will love thee!”</p><p>“Thou canst not think,” said the minister, glancing asideat Hester Prynne, “how my heart dreads this interview, andyearns for it! But, in truth, as I already told thee, childrenare not readily won to be familiar with me. They will notclimb my knee, nor prattle in my ear, nor answer to my smile;but stand apart, and eye me strangely. Even little babes, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>I take them in my arms, weep bitterly. Yet Pearl, twice inher little lifetime, hath been kind to me! The first time,—thouknowest it well! The last was when thou ledst her withthee to the house of yonder stern old Governor.”</p><p>“And thou didst plead so bravely in her behalf and mine!”answered the mother. “I remember it; and so shall littlePearl. Fear nothing! She may be strange and shy at first,but will soon learn to love thee!”</p><p>By this time Pearl had reached the margin of the brook, andstood on the farther side, gazing silently at Hester and theclergyman, who still sat together on the mossy tree-trunk, waitingto receive her. Just where she had paused, the brookchanced to form a pool, so smooth and quiet that it reflecteda perfect image of her little figure, with all the brilliant picturesquenessof her beauty, in its adornment of flowers and wreathedfoliage, but more refined and spiritualized than the reality. Thisimage, so nearly identical with the living Pearl, seemed to communicatesomewhat of its own shadowy and intangible qualityto the child herself. It was strange, the way in which Pearlstood, looking so steadfastly at them through the dim mediumof the forest-gloom; herself, meanwhile, all glorified with a rayof sunshine, that was attracted thitherward as by a certain sympathy.In the brook beneath stood another child,—anotherand the same,—with likewise its ray of golden light. Hesterfelt herself, in some indistinct and tantalizing manner, estrangedfrom Pearl; as if the child, in her lonely ramble through theforest, had strayed out of the sphere in which she and hermother dwelt together, and was now vainly seeking to returnto it.</p><p>There was both truth and error in the impression; the child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>and mother were estranged, but through Hester's fault, notPearl's. Since the latter rambled from her side, another inmatehad been admitted within the circle of the mother's feelings,and so modified the aspect of them all, that Pearl, the returningwanderer, could not find her wonted place, and hardly knewwhere she was.</p><p>“I have a strange fancy,” observed the sensitive minister,“that this brook is the boundary between two worlds, and thatthou canst never meet thy Pearl again. Or is she an elfishspirit, who, as the legends of our childhood taught us, is forbiddento cross a running stream? Pray hasten her; for thisdelay has already imparted a tremor to my nerves.”</p><p>“Come, dearest child!” said Hester, encouragingly, and stretchingout both her arms. “How slow thou art! When hastthou been so sluggish before now? Here is a friend of mine,who must be thy friend also. Thou wilt have twice as muchlove, henceforward, as thy mother alone could give thee! Leapacross the brook, and come to us. Thou canst leap like ayoung deer!”</p><p class="figcenter"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25344/25344-h/images/illu_257.jpg"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_257_th.jpg" alt="The Child at the Brook-Side" title="The Child at the Brook-Side"></a></p><p>Pearl, without responding in any manner to these honey-sweetexpressions, remained on the other side of the brook. Now shefixed her bright, wild eyes on her mother, now on the minister,and now included them both in the same glance; as if to detectand explain to herself the relation which they bore to oneanother. For some unaccountable reason, as Arthur Dimmesdale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>felt the child's eyes upon himself, his hand—with thatgesture so habitual as to have become involuntary—stole overhis heart. At length, assuming a singular air of authority,Pearl stretched out her hand, with the small forefinger extended,and pointing evidently towards her mother's breast. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>beneath, in the mirror of the brook, there was the flower-girdledand sunny image of little Pearl, pointing her small forefingertoo.</p><p>“Thou strange child, why dost thou not come to me?” exclaimedHester.</p><p>Pearl still pointed with her forefinger; and a frown gatheredon her brow; the more impressive from the childish, the almostbaby-like aspect of the features that conveyed it. As her motherstill kept beckoning to her, and arraying her face in a holidaysuit of unaccustomed smiles, the child stamped her foot with ayet more imperious look and gesture. In the brook, again, wasthe fantastic beauty of the image, with its reflected frown, itspointed finger, and imperious gesture, giving emphasis to theaspect of little Pearl.</p><p>“Hasten, Pearl; or I shall be angry with thee!” criedHester Prynne, who, however inured to such behavior onthe elf-child's part at other seasons, was naturally anxiousfor a more seemly deportment now. “Leap across thebrook, naughty child, and run hither! Else I must come tothee!”</p><p>But Pearl, not a whit startled at her mother's threats, anymore than mollified by her entreaties, now suddenly burst intoa fit of passion, gesticulating violently, and throwing her smallfigure into the most extravagant contortions. She accompaniedthis wild outbreak with piercing shrieks, which the woods reverberatedon all sides; so that, alone as she was in her childishand unreasonable wrath, it seemed as if a hidden multitude werelending her their sympathy and encouragement. Seen in thebrook, once more, was the shadowy wrath of Pearl's image,crowned and girdled with flowers, but stamping its foot, wildly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>gesticulating, and, in the midst of all, still pointing its smallforefinger at Hester's bosom!</p><p>“I see what ails the child,” whispered Hester to the clergyman,and turning pale in spite of a strong effort to conceal hertrouble and annoyance. “Children will not abide any, theslightest, change in the accustomed aspect of things that aredaily before their eyes. Pearl misses something which she hasalways seen me wear!”</p><p>“I pray you,” answered the minister, “if thou hast anymeans of pacifying the child, do it forthwith! Save it were thecankered wrath of an old witch, like Mistress Hibbins,” addedhe, attempting to smile, “I know nothing that I would notsooner encounter than this passion in a child. In Pearl's youngbeauty, as in the wrinkled witch, it has a preternatural effect.Pacify her, if thou lovest me!”</p><p>Hester turned again towards Pearl, with a crimson blush uponher cheek, a conscious glance aside at the clergyman, and then aheavy sigh; while, even before she had time to speak, the blushyielded to a deadly pallor.</p><p>“Pearl,” said she, sadly, “look down at thy feet! There!—beforethee!—on the hither side of the brook!”</p><p>The child turned her eyes to the point indicated; and therelay the scarlet letter, so close upon the margin of the stream,that the gold embroidery was reflected in it.</p><p>“Bring it hither!” said Hester.</p><p>“Come thou and take it up!” answered Pearl.</p><p>“Was ever such a child!” observed Hester, aside to theminister. “O, I have much to tell thee about her! But, invery truth, she is right as regards this hateful token. I mustbear its torture yet a little longer,—only a few days longer,—until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>we shall have left this region, and look back hither asto a land which we have dreamed of. The forest cannot hideit! The mid-ocean shall take it from my hand, and swallow itup forever!”</p><p>With these words, she advanced to the margin of the brook,took up the scarlet letter, and fastened it again into her bosom.Hopefully, but a moment ago, as Hester had spoken of drowningit in the deep sea, there was a sense of inevitable doomupon her, as she thus received back this deadly symbol fromthe hand of fate. She had flung it into infinite space!—shehad drawn an hour's free breath!—and here again was thescarlet misery, glittering on the old spot! So it ever is, whetherthus typified or no, that an evil deed invests itself with thecharacter of doom. Hester next gathered up the heavy tressesof her hair, and confined them beneath her cap. As if therewere a withering spell in the sad letter, her beauty, the warmthand richness of her womanhood, departed, like fading sunshine;and a gray shadow seemed to fall across her.</p><p>When the dreary change was wrought, she extended her handto Pearl.</p><p>“Dost thou know thy mother now, child?” asked she, reproachfully,but with a subdued tone. “Wilt thou come acrossthe brook, and own thy mother, now that she has her shameupon her,—now that she is sad?”</p><p>“Yes; now I will!” answered the child, bounding acrossthe brook, and clasping Hester in her arms. “Now thou artmy mother indeed! And I am thy little Pearl!”</p><p>In a mood of tenderness that was not usual with her, shedrew down her mother's head, and kissed her brow and bothher cheeks. But then—by a kind of necessity that always impelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>this child to alloy whatever comfort she might chance togive with a throb of anguish—Pearl put up her mouth, andkissed the scarlet letter too!</p><p>“That was not kind!” said Hester. “When thou hast shownme a little love, thou mockest me!”</p><p>“Why doth the minister sit yonder?” asked Pearl.</p><p>“He waits to welcome thee,” replied her mother. “Comethou, and entreat his blessing! He loves thee, my little Pearl,and loves thy mother too. Wilt thou not love him? Come!he longs to greet thee!”</p><p>“Doth he love us?” said Pearl, looking up, with acuteintelligence, into her mother's face. “Will he go back withus, hand in hand, we three together, into the town?”</p><p>“Not now, dear child,” answered Hester. “But in days tocome he will walk hand in hand with us. We will have ahome and fireside of our own; and thou shalt sit upon hisknee; and he will teach thee many things, and love thee dearly.Thou wilt love him; wilt thou not?”</p><p>“And will he always keep his hand over his heart?” inquiredPearl.</p><p>“Foolish child, what a question is that!” exclaimed hermother. “Come and ask his blessing!”</p><p>But, whether influenced by the jealousy that seems instinctivewith every petted child towards a dangerous rival, or from whatevercaprice of her freakish nature, Pearl would show no favorto the clergyman. It was only by an exertion of force thather mother brought her up to him, hanging back, and manifestingher reluctance by odd grimaces; of which, ever since herbabyhood, she had possessed a singular variety, and could transformher mobile physiognomy into a series of different aspects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>with a new mischief in them, each and all. The minister—painfullyembarrassed, but hoping that a kiss might prove atalisman to admit him into the child's kindlier regards—bentforward, and impressed one on her brow. Hereupon, Pearlbroke away from her mother, and, running to the brook, stoopedover it, and bathed her forehead, until the unwelcome kiss wasquite washed off, and diffused through a long lapse of the glidingwater. She then remained apart, silently watching Hesterand the clergyman; while they talked together, and made sucharrangements as were suggested by their new position, and thepurposes soon to be fulfilled.</p><p>And now this fateful interview had come to a close. Thedell was to be left a solitude among its dark, old trees, which,with their multitudinous tongues, would whisper long of whathad passed there, and no mortal be the wiser. And the melancholybrook would add this other tale to the mystery withwhich its little heart was already overburdened, and whereof itstill kept up a murmuring babble, with not a whit more cheerfulnessof tone than for ages heretofore.</p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; padding-top: 1em"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_103.jpg" width="400" height="114" alt="" title=""></div><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; padding-top: 4em"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/ornament_iv.jpg" width="400" height="111" alt="" title=""></div><h2><a name="XX" id="XX"></a>XX.</h2><h4>THE MINISTER IN A MAZE.</h4><div class="initial"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/initial_a.jpg" alt="A" title="A"></div><p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">s</span> the minister departed, in advance of HesterPrynne and little Pearl, he threw a backwardglance; half expecting that he shoulddiscover only some faintly traced features oroutline of the mother and the child, slowlyfading into the twilight of the woods. Sogreat a vicissitude in his life could not at once be received asreal. But there was Hester, clad in her gray robe, still standingbeside the tree-trunk, which some blast had overthrown a longantiquity ago, and which time had ever since been coveringwith moss, so that these two fated ones, with earth's heaviestburden on them, might there sit down together, and find a singlehour's rest and solace. And there was Pearl, too, lightly dancingfrom the margin of the brook,—now that the intrusive thirdperson was gone,—and taking her old place by her mother'sside. So the minister had not fallen asleep and dreamed!</p><p>In order to free his mind from this indistinctness and duplicityof impression, which vexed it with a strange disquietude, herecalled and more thoroughly defined the plans which Hester<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>and himself had sketched for their departure. It had been determinedbetween them, that the Old World, with its crowds andcities, offered them a more eligible shelter and concealment thanthe wilds of New England, or all America, with its alternativesof an Indian wigwam, or the few settlements of Europeans,scattered thinly along the seaboard. Not to speak of the clergyman'shealth, so inadequate to sustain the hardships of a forestlife, his native gifts, his culture, and his entire development,would secure him a home only in the midst of civilization andrefinement; the higher the state, the more delicately adaptedto it the man. In furtherance of this choice, it so happenedthat a ship lay in the harbor; one of those questionable cruisers,frequent at that day, which, without being absolutely outlawsof the deep, yet roamed over its surface with a remarkable irresponsibilityof character. This vessel had recently arrived fromthe Spanish Main, and, within three days' time, would sail forBristol. Hester Prynne—whose vocation, as a self-enlistedSister of Charity, had brought her acquainted with the captainand crew—could take upon herself to secure the passage oftwo individuals and a child, with all the secrecy which circumstancesrendered more than desirable.</p><p>The minister had inquired of Hester, with no little interest,the precise time at which the vessel might be expected todepart. It would probably be on the fourth day from the present.“That is most fortunate!” he had then said to himself.Now, why the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale considered it so veryfortunate, we hesitate to reveal. Nevertheless,—to hold nothingback from the reader,—it was because, on the third dayfrom the present, he was to preach the Election Sermon; and,as such an occasion formed an honorable epoch in the life of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>a New England clergyman, he could not have chanced upon amore suitable mode and time of terminating his professionalcareer. “At least, they shall say of me,” thought this exemplaryman, “that I leave no public duty unperformed, nor illperformed!” Sad, indeed, that an introspection so profoundand acute as this poor minister's should be so miserably deceived!We have had, and may still have, worse things to tell of him;but none, we apprehend, so pitiably weak; no evidence, at onceso slight and irrefragable, of a subtle disease, that had longsince begun to eat into the real substance of his character. Noman, for any considerable period, can wear one face to himself,and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewilderedas to which may be the true.</p><p>The excitement of Mr. Dimmesdale's feelings, as he returnedfrom his interview with Hester, lent him unaccustomed physicalenergy, and hurried him townward at a rapid pace. The pathwayamong the woods seemed wilder, more uncouth with itsrude natural obstacles, and less trodden by the foot of man,than he remembered it on his outward journey. But he leapedacross the plashy places, thrust himself through the clingingunderbrush, climbed the ascent, plunged into the hollow, andovercame, in short, all the difficulties of the track, with anunweariable activity that astonished him. He could not butrecall how feebly, and with what frequent pauses for breath, hehad toiled over the same ground, only two days before. As hedrew near the town, he took an impression of change from theseries of familiar objects that presented themselves. It seemednot yesterday, not one, nor two, but many days, or even yearsago, since he had quitted them. There, indeed, was each formertrace of the street, as he remembered it, and all the peculiarities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>of the houses, with the due multitude of gable-peaks, and aweathercock at every point where his memory suggested one.Not the less, however, came this importunately obtrusive senseof change. The same was true as regarded the acquaintanceswhom he met, and all the well-known shapes of human life,about the little town. They looked neither older nor youngernow; the beards of the aged were no whiter, nor could thecreeping babe of yesterday walk on his feet to-day; it wasimpossible to describe in what respect they differed from theindividuals on whom he had so recently bestowed a partingglance; and yet the minister's deepest sense seemed to informhim of their mutability. A similar impression struck him mostremarkably, as he passed under the walls of his own church.The edifice had so very strange, and yet so familiar, an aspect,that Mr. Dimmesdale's mind vibrated between two ideas; eitherthat he had seen it only in a dream hitherto, or that he wasmerely dreaming about it now.</p><p>This phenomenon, in the various shapes which it assumed,indicated no external change, but so sudden and important achange in the spectator of the familiar scene, that the interveningspace of a single day had operated on his consciousness likethe lapse of years. The minister's own will, and Hester's will,and the fate that grew between them, had wrought this transformation.It was the same town as heretofore; but the sameminister returned not from the forest. He might have said tothe friends who greeted him,—“I am not the man for whomyou take me! I left him yonder in the forest, withdrawn intoa secret dell, by a mossy tree-trunk, and near a melancholybrook! Go, seek your minister, and see if his emaciated figure,his thin cheek, his white, heavy, pain-wrinkled brow, be not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>flung down there, like a cast-off garment!” His friends, nodoubt, would still have insisted with him,—“Thou art thyselfthe man!”—but the error would have been their own, not his.</p><p>Before Mr. Dimmesdale reached home, his inner man gavehim other evidences of a revolution in the sphere of thoughtand feeling. In truth, nothing short of a total change ofdynasty and moral code, in that interior kingdom, was adequateto account for the impulses now communicated to the unfortunateand startled minister. At every step he was incited to dosome strange, wild, wicked thing or other, with a sense that itwould be at once involuntary and intentional; in spite of himself,yet growing out of a profounder self than that whichopposed the impulse. For instance, he met one of his owndeacons. The good old man addressed him with the paternalaffection and patriarchal privilege, which his venerable age, hisupright and holy character, and his station in the Church,entitled him to use; and, conjoined with this, the deep, almostworshipping respect, which the minister's professional and privateclaims alike demanded. Never was there a more beautifulexample of how the majesty of age and wisdom may comportwith the obeisance and respect enjoined upon it, as from alower social rank, and inferior order of endowment, towardsa higher. Now, during a conversation of some two or threemoments between the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale and this excellentand hoary-bearded deacon, it was only by the most carefulself-control that the former could refrain from uttering certainblasphemous suggestions that rose into his mind, respecting thecommunion supper. He absolutely trembled and turned pale asashes, lest his tongue should wag itself, in utterance of thesehorrible matters, and plead his own consent for so doing, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>his having fairly given it. And, even with this terror inhis heart, he could hardly avoid laughing, to imagine how thesanctified old patriarchal deacon would have been petrified byhis minister's impiety!</p><p>Again, another incident of the same nature. Hurrying alongthe street, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale encountered the eldestfemale member of his church; a most pious and exemplary olddame; poor, widowed, lonely, and with a heart as full ofreminiscences about her dead husband and children, and herdead friends of long ago, as a burial-ground is full of storiedgravestones. Yet all this, which would else have been suchheavy sorrow, was made almost a solemn joy to her devout oldsoul, by religious consolations and the truths of Scripture,wherewith she had fed herself continually for more than thirtyyears. And, since Mr. Dimmesdale had taken her in charge,the good grandam's chief earthly comfort—which, unless it hadbeen likewise a heavenly comfort, could have been none at all—wasto meet her pastor, whether casually, or of set purpose,and be refreshed with a word of warm, fragrant, heaven-breathingGospel truth, from his beloved lips, into her dulled, butrapturously attentive ear. But, on this occasion, up to themoment of putting his lips to the old woman's ear, Mr. Dimmesdale,as the great enemy of souls would have it, could recall notext of Scripture, nor aught else, except a brief, pithy, and, asit then appeared to him, unanswerable argument against theimmortality of the human soul. The instilment thereof into hermind would probably have caused this aged sister to drop downdead, at once, as by the effect of an intensely poisonous infusion.What he really did whisper, the minister could never afterwardsrecollect. There was, perhaps, a fortunate disorder in his utterance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>which failed to impart any distinct idea to the goodwidow's comprehension, or which Providence interpreted after amethod of its own. Assuredly, as the minister looked back, hebeheld an expression of divine gratitude and ecstasy that seemedlike the shine of the celestial city on her face, so wrinkled andashy pale.</p><p>Again, a third instance. After parting from the old church-member,he met the youngest sister of them all. It was amaiden newly won—and won by the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale'sown sermon, on the Sabbath after his vigil—to barterthe transitory pleasures of the world for the heavenly hope, thatwas to assume brighter substance as life grew dark around her,and which would gild the utter gloom with final glory. Shewas fair and pure as a lily that had bloomed in Paradise. Theminister knew well that he was himself enshrined within thestainless sanctity of her heart, which hung its snowy curtainsabout his image, imparting to religion the warmth of love, andto love a religious purity. Satan, that afternoon, had surely ledthe poor young girl away from her mother's side, and thrownher into the pathway of this sorely tempted, or—shall we notrather say?—this lost and desperate man. As she drew nigh,the arch-fiend whispered him to condense into small compassand drop into her tender bosom a germ of evil that would besure to blossom darkly soon, and bear black fruit betimes. Suchwas his sense of power over this virgin soul, trusting him asshe did, that the minister felt potent to blight all the field ofinnocence with but one wicked look, and develop all its oppositewith but a word. So—with a mightier struggle than he hadyet sustained—he held his Geneva cloak before his face, andhurried onward, making no sign of recognition, and leaving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>young sister to digest his rudeness as she might. She ransackedher conscience,—which was full of harmless little matters, likeher pocket or her work-bag,—and took herself to task, poorthing! for a thousand imaginary faults; and went about herhousehold duties with swollen eyelids the next morning.</p><p>Before the minister had time to celebrate his victory over thislast temptation, he was conscious of another impulse, more ludicrous,and almost as horrible. It was,—we blush to tell it,—itwas to stop short in the road, and teach some very wickedwords to a knot of little Puritan children who were playingthere, and had but just begun to talk. Denying himself thisfreak, as unworthy of his cloth, he met a drunken seaman, oneof the ship's crew from the Spanish Main. And, here, sincehe had so valiantly forborne all other wickedness, poor Mr.Dimmesdale longed, at least, to shake hands with the tarryblackguard, and recreate himself with a few improper jests, suchas dissolute sailors so abound with, and a volley of good, round,solid, satisfactory, and heaven-defying oaths! It was not somuch a better principle as partly his natural good taste, andstill more his buckramed habit of clerical decorum, that carriedhim safely through the latter crisis.</p><p>“What is it that haunts and tempts me thus?” cried theminister to himself, at length, pausing in the street, and strikinghis hand against his forehead. “Am I mad? or am I givenover utterly to the fiend? Did I make a contract with himin the forest, and sign it with my blood? And does he nowsummon me to its fulfilment, by suggesting the performanceof every wickedness which his most foul imagination can conceive?”</p><p>At the moment when the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>communed with himself, and struck his forehead with his hand,old Mistress Hibbins, the reputed witch-lady, is said to havebeen passing by. She made a very grand appearance; havingon a high head-dress, a rich gown of velvet, and a ruff done upwith the famous yellow starch, of which Ann Turner, her especialfriend, had taught her the secret, before this last good ladyhad been hanged for Sir Thomas Overbury's murder. Whetherthe witch had read the minister's thoughts, or no, she came toa full stop, looked shrewdly into his face, smiled craftily, and—thoughlittle given to converse with clergymen—began a conversation.</p><p>“So, reverend Sir, you have made a visit into the forest,”observed the witch-lady, nodding her high head-dress at him.“The next time, I pray you to allow me only a fair warning,and I shall be proud to bear you company. Without takingovermuch upon myself, my good word will go far towards gainingany strange gentleman a fair reception from yonder potentateyou wot of!”</p><p>“I profess, madam,” answered the clergyman, with a graveobeisance, such as the lady's rank demanded, and his own good-breedingmade imperative,—“I profess, on my conscience andcharacter, that I am utterly bewildered as touching the purportof your words! I went not into the forest to seek a potentate;neither do I, at any future time, design a visit thither, with aview to gaining the favor of such a personage. My one sufficientobject was to greet that pious friend of mine, the ApostleEliot, and rejoice with him over the many precious souls hehath won from heathendom!”</p><p>“Ha, ha, ha!” cackled the old witch-lady, still nodding herhigh head-dress at the minister. “Well, well, we must needs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>talk thus in the daytime! You carry it off like an old hand!But at midnight, and in the forest, we shall have other talktogether!”</p><p>She passed on with her aged stateliness, but often turningback her head and smiling at him, like one willing to recognizea secret intimacy of connection.</p><p>“Have I then sold myself,” thought the minister, “to thefiend whom, if men say true, this yellow-starched and velvetedold hag has chosen for her prince and master!”</p><p>The wretched minister! He had made a bargain very likeit! Tempted by a dream of happiness, he had yielded himself,with deliberate choice, as he had never done before, to what heknew was deadly sin. And the infectious poison of that sinhad been thus rapidly diffused throughout his moral system. Ithad stupefied all blessed impulses, and awakened into vivid lifethe whole brotherhood of bad ones. Scorn, bitterness, unprovokedmalignity, gratuitous desire of ill, ridicule of whateverwas good and holy, all awoke, to tempt, even while they frightenedhim. And his encounter with old Mistress Hibbins, if itwere a real incident, did but show his sympathy and fellowshipwith wicked mortals, and the world of perverted spirits.</p><p>He had, by this time, reached his dwelling, on the edge ofthe burial-ground, and, hastening up the stairs, took refuge inhis study. The minister was glad to have reached this shelter,without first betraying himself to the world by any of thosestrange and wicked eccentricities to which he had been continuallyimpelled while passing through the streets. He enteredthe accustomed room, and looked around him on its books, itswindows, its fireplace, and the tapestried comfort of the walls,with the same perception of strangeness that had haunted him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>throughout his walk from the forest-dell into the town, andthitherward. Here he had studied and written; here, gonethrough fast and vigil, and come forth half alive; here, strivento pray; here, borne a hundred thousand agonies! There wasthe Bible, in its rich old Hebrew, with Moses and the Prophetsspeaking to him, and God's voice through all! There, on thetable, with the inky pen beside it, was an unfinished sermon,with a sentence broken in the midst, where his thoughts hadceased to gush out upon the page, two days before. He knewthat it was himself, the thin and white-cheeked minister, whohad done and suffered these things, and written thus far intothe Election Sermon! But he seemed to stand apart, and eyethis former self with scornful, pitying, but half-envious curiosity.That self was gone. Another man had returned out of the forest;a wiser one; with a knowledge of hidden mysteries which thesimplicity of the former never could have reached. A bitterkind of knowledge that!</p><p>While occupied with these reflections, a knock came at thedoor of the study, and the minister said, “Come in!”—notwholly devoid of an idea that he might behold an evil spirit.And so he did! It was old Roger Chillingworth that entered.The minister stood, white and speechless, with one hand on theHebrew Scriptures, and the other spread upon his breast.</p><p>“Welcome home, reverend Sir,” said the physician. “And howfound you that godly man, the Apostle Eliot? But methinks,dear Sir, you look pale; as if the travel through the wilderness hadbeen too sore for you. Will not my aid be requisite to putyou in heart and strength to preach your Election Sermon?”</p><p>“Nay, I think not so,” rejoined the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale.“My journey, and the sight of the holy Apostle yonder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>and the free air which I have breathed, have done me good,after so long confinement in my study. I think to need nomore of your drugs, my kind physician, good though they be,and administered by a friendly hand.”</p><p>All this time, Roger Chillingworth was looking at the ministerwith the grave and intent regard of a physician towardshis patient. But, in spite of this outward show, the latter wasalmost convinced of the old man's knowledge, or, at least, hisconfident suspicion, with respect to his own interview with HesterPrynne. The physician knew then, that, in the minister's regard,he was no longer a trusted friend, but his bitterest enemy. Somuch being known, it would appear natural that a part of itshould be expressed. It is singular, however, how long a timeoften passes before words embody things; and with what securitytwo persons, who choose to avoid a certain subject, may approachits very verge, and retire without disturbing it. Thus, theminister felt no apprehension that Roger Chillingworth wouldtouch, in express words, upon the real position which they sustainedtowards one another. Yet did the physician, in his darkway, creep frightfully near the secret.</p><p>“Were it not better,” said he, “that you use my poor skillto-night? Verily, dear Sir, we must take pains to make youstrong and vigorous for this occasion of the Election discourse.The people look for great things from you; apprehending thatanother year may come about, and find their pastor gone.”</p><p>“Yea, to another world,” replied the minister, with piousresignation. “Heaven grant it be a better one; for, in goodsooth, I hardly think to tarry with my flock through the flittingseasons of another year! But, touching your medicine, kindSir, in my present frame of body, I need it not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>”</p><p>“I joy to hear it,” answered the physician. “It may bethat my remedies, so long administered in vain, begin now totake due effect. Happy man were I, and well deserving of NewEngland's gratitude, could I achieve this cure!”</p><p>“I thank you from my heart, most watchful friend,” said theReverend Mr. Dimmesdale, with a solemn smile. “I thank you,and can but requite your good deeds with my prayers.”</p><p>“A good man's prayers are golden recompense!” rejoinedold Roger Chillingworth, as he took his leave. “Yea, they arethe current gold coin of the New Jerusalem, with the King'sown mint-mark on them!”</p><p>Left alone, the minister summoned a servant of the house,and requested food, which, being set before him, he ate withravenous appetite. Then, flinging the already written pages ofthe Election Sermon into the fire, he forthwith began another,which he wrote with such an impulsive flow of thought andemotion, that he fancied himself inspired; and only wonderedthat Heaven should see fit to transmit the grand and solemnmusic of its oracles through so foul an organ-pipe as he. However,leaving that mystery to solve itself, or go unsolved forever,he drove his task onward, with earnest haste and ecstasy. Thusthe night fled away, as if it were a winged steed, and he careeringon it; morning came, and peeped, blushing, through thecurtains; and at last sunrise threw a golden beam into thestudy and laid it right across the minister's bedazzled eyes.There he was, with the pen still between his fingers, and a vast,immeasurable tract of written space behind him!</p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; padding-top: 4em"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/ornament_iv.jpg" width="400" height="111" alt="" title=""></div><h2><a name="XXI" id="XXI"></a>XXI.</h2><h4>THE NEW ENGLAND HOLIDAY.</h4><div class="initial"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/initial_b.jpg" alt="B" title="B"></div><p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">etimes</span> in the morning of the day on whichthe new Governor was to receive his office atthe hands of the people, Hester Prynne andlittle Pearl came into the market-place. Itwas already thronged with the craftsmen andother plebeian inhabitants of the town, inconsiderable numbers; among whom, likewise, were many roughfigures, whose attire of deer-skins marked them as belonging tosome of the forest settlements, which surrounded the little metropolisof the colony.</p><p>On this public holiday, as on all other occasions, for sevenyears past, Hester was clad in a garment of coarse gray cloth.Not more by its hue than by some indescribable peculiarity inits fashion, it had the effect of making her fade personally outof sight and outline; while, again, the scarlet letter broughther back from this twilight indistinctness, and revealed herunder the moral aspect of its own illumination. Her face, solong familiar to the towns-people, showed the marble quietudewhich they were accustomed to behold there. It was like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>mask; or, rather, like the frozen calmness of a dead woman'sfeatures; owing this dreary resemblance to the fact that Hesterwas actually dead, in respect to any claim of sympathy, andhad departed out of the world with which she still seemed tomingle.</p><p>It might be, on this one day, that there was an expressionunseen before, nor, indeed, vivid enough to be detected now;unless some preternaturally gifted observer should have first readthe heart, and have afterwards sought a corresponding developmentin the countenance and mien. Such a spiritual seer mighthave conceived, that, after sustaining the gaze of the multitudethrough seven miserable years as a necessity, a penance, andsomething which it was a stern religion to endure, she now, forone last time more, encountered it freely and voluntarily, inorder to convert what had so long been agony into a kind oftriumph. “Look your last on the scarlet letter and its wearer!”—thepeople's victim and life-long bond-slave, as they fanciedher, might say to them. “Yet a little while, and she will bebeyond your reach! A few hours longer, and the deep, mysteriousocean will quench and hide forever the symbol which yehave caused to burn upon her bosom!” Nor were it an inconsistencytoo improbable to be assigned to human nature, shouldwe suppose a feeling of regret in Hester's mind, at the momentwhen she was about to win her freedom from the pain whichhad been thus deeply incorporated with her being. Might therenot be an irresistible desire to quaff a last, long, breathlessdraught of the cup of wormwood and aloes, with which nearlyall her years of womanhood had been perpetually flavored? Thewine of life, henceforth to be presented to her lips, must beindeed rich, delicious, and exhilarating, in its chased and golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>beaker; or else leave an inevitable and weary languor, after thelees of bitterness wherewith she had been drugged, as with acordial of intensest potency.</p><p>Pearl was decked out with airy gayety. It would have beenimpossible to guess that this bright and sunny apparition owedits existence to the shape of gloomy gray; or that a fancy, atonce so gorgeous and so delicate as must have been requisite tocontrive the child's apparel, was the same that had achieved atask perhaps more difficult, in imparting so distinct a peculiarityto Hester's simple robe. The dress, so proper was it to littlePearl, seemed an effluence, or inevitable development and outwardmanifestation of her character, no more to be separatedfrom her than the many-hued brilliancy from a butterfly's wing,or the painted glory from the leaf of a bright flower. As withthese, so with the child; her garb was all of one idea with hernature. On this eventful day, moreover, there was a certainsingular inquietude and excitement in her mood, resemblingnothing so much as the shimmer of a diamond, that sparklesand flashes with the varied throbbings of the breast on whichit is displayed. Children have always a sympathy in the agitationsof those connected with them; always, especially, a senseof any trouble or impending revolution, of whatever kind, indomestic circumstances; and therefore Pearl, who was the gemon her mother's unquiet bosom, betrayed, by the very dance ofher spirits, the emotions which none could detect in the marblepassiveness of Hester's brow.</p><p>This effervescence made her flit with a bird-like movement,rather than walk by her mother's side. She broke continuallyinto shouts of a wild, inarticulate, and sometimes piercing music.When they reached the market-place, she became still more restless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>on perceiving the stir and bustle that enlivened the spot;for it was usually more like the broad and lonesome greenbefore a village meeting-house, than the centre of a town'sbusiness.</p><p>“Why, what is this, mother?” cried she. “Wherefore haveall the people left their work to-day? Is it a play-day for thewhole world? See, there is the blacksmith! He has washedhis sooty face, and put on his Sabbath-day clothes, and looksas if he would gladly be merry, if any kind body would onlyteach him how! And there is Master Brackett, the old jailer,nodding and smiling at me. Why does he do so, mother?”</p><p>“He remembers thee a little babe, my child,” answeredHester.</p><p>“He should not nod and smile at me, for all that,—theblack, grim, ugly-eyed old man!” said Pearl. “He may nodat thee, if he will; for thou art clad in gray, and wearest thescarlet letter. But see, mother, how many faces of strangepeople, and Indians among them, and sailors! What have theyall come to do, here in the market-place?”</p><p>“They wait to see the procession pass,” said Hester. “Forthe Governor and the magistrates are to go by, and the ministers,and all the great people and good people, with the musicand the soldiers marching before them.”</p><p>“And will the minister be there?” asked Pearl. “Andwill he hold out both his hands to me, as when thou ledst meto him from the brook-side?”</p><p>“He will be there, child,” answered her mother. “But hewill not greet thee to-day; nor must thou greet him.”</p><p>“What a strange, sad man is he!” said the child, as if speakingpartly to herself. “In the dark night-time he calls us to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>him, and holds thy hand and mine, as when we stood with himon the scaffold yonder. And in the deep forest, where only theold trees can hear, and the strip of sky see it, he talks withthee, sitting on a heap of moss! And he kisses my forehead,too, so that the little brook would hardly wash it off! Buthere, in the sunny day, and among all the people, he knowsus not; nor must we know him! A strange, sad man is he,with his hand always over his heart!”</p><p>“Be quiet, Pearl! Thou understandest not these things,”said her mother. “Think not now of the minister, but lookabout thee, and see how cheery is everybody's face to-day. Thechildren have come from their schools, and the grown peoplefrom their workshops and their fields, on purpose to be happy.For, to-day, a new man is beginning to rule over them; andso—as has been the custom of mankind ever since a nationwas first gathered—they make merry and rejoice; as if a goodand golden year were at length to pass over the poor oldworld!”</p><p>It was as Hester said, in regard to the unwonted jollity thatbrightened the faces of the people. Into this festal season ofthe year—as it already was, and continued to be during thegreater part of two centuries—the Puritans compressed whatevermirth and public joy they deemed allowable to humaninfirmity; thereby so far dispelling the customary cloud, that,for the space of a single holiday, they appeared scarcely moregrave than most other communities at a period of generalaffliction.</p><p>But we perhaps exaggerate the gray or sable tinge, whichundoubtedly characterized the mood and manners of the age.The persons now in the market-place of Boston had not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>born to an inheritance of Puritanic gloom. They were nativeEnglishmen, whose fathers had lived in the sunny richness of theElizabethan epoch; a time when the life of England, viewed asone great mass, would appear to have been as stately, magnificent,and joyous, as the world has ever witnessed. Had theyfollowed their hereditary taste, the New England settlers wouldhave illustrated all events of public importance by bonfires, banquets,pageantries, and processions. Nor would it have beenimpracticable, in the observance of majestic ceremonies, to combinemirthful recreation with solemnity, and give, as it were,a grotesque and brilliant embroidery to the great robe ofstate, which a nation, at such festivals, puts on. There wassome shadow of an attempt of this kind in the mode of celebratingthe day on which the political year of the colonycommenced. The dim reflection of a remembered splendor, acolorless and manifold diluted repetition of what they had beheldin proud old London,—we will not say at a royal coronation,but at a Lord Mayor's show,—might be traced in the customswhich our forefathers instituted, with reference to theannual installation of magistrates. The fathers and foundersof the commonwealth—the statesman, the priest, and the soldier—deemedit a duty then to assume the outward state andmajesty, which, in accordance with antique style, was lookedupon as the proper garb of public or social eminence. All cameforth, to move in procession before the people's eye, and thusimpart a needed dignity to the simple framework of a governmentso newly constructed.</p><p>Then, too, the people were countenanced, if not encouraged,in relaxing the severe and close application to their variousmodes of rugged industry, which, at all other times, seemed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>the same piece and material with their religion. Here, it istrue, were none of the applicances which popular merrimentwould so readily have found in the England of Elizabeth'stime, or that of James;—no rude shows of a theatrical kind;no minstrel, with his harp and legendary ballad, nor gleeman,with an ape dancing to his music; no juggler, with his tricksof mimic witchcraft; no Merry Andrew, to stir up the multitudewith jests, perhaps hundreds of years old, but still effective,by their appeals to the very broadest sources of mirthful sympathy.All such professors of the several branches of jocularitywould have been sternly repressed, not only by the rigid disciplineof law, but by the general sentiment which gives law itsvitality. Not the less, however, the great, honest face of thepeople smiled, grimly, perhaps, but widely too. Nor were sportswanting, such as the colonists had witnessed, and shared in, longago, at the country fairs and on the village-greens of England;and which it was thought well to keep alive on this new soil,for the sake of the courage and manliness that were essentialin them. Wrestling-matches, in the different fashions of Cornwalland Devonshire, were seen here and there about the market-place;in one corner, there was a friendly bout at quarterstaff;and—what attracted most interest of all—on the platform ofthe pillory, already so noted in our pages, two masters of defencewere commencing an exhibition with the buckler and broadsword.But, much to the disappointment of the crowd, this latter businesswas broken off by the interposition of the town beadle,who had no idea of permitting the majesty of the law to beviolated by such an abuse of one of its consecrated places.</p><p>It may not be too much to affirm, on the whole, (the peoplebeing then in the first stages of joyless deportment, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>offspring of sires who had known how to be merry, in theirday,) that they would compare favorably, in point of holidaykeeping, with their descendants, even at so long an interval asourselves. Their immediate posterity, the generation next to theearly emigrants, wore the blackest shade of Puritanism, and sodarkened the national visage with it, that all the subsequentyears have not sufficed to clear it up. We have yet to learnagain the forgotten art of gayety.</p><p>The picture of human life in the market-place, though itsgeneral tint was the sad gray, brown, or black of the Englishemigrants, was yet enlivened by some diversity of hue. A partyof Indians—in their savage finery of curiously embroidereddeer-skin robes, wampum-belts, red and yellow ochre, andfeathers, and armed with the bow and arrow and stone-headedspear—stood apart, with countenances of inflexible gravity,beyond what even the Puritan aspect could attain. Nor, wildas were these painted barbarians, were they the wildest featureof the scene. This distinction could more justly be claimed bysome mariners,—a part of the crew of the vessel from theSpanish Main,—who had come ashore to see the humors ofElection Day. They were rough-looking desperadoes, with sun-blackenedfaces, and an immensity of beard; their wide, shorttrousers were confined about the waist by belts, often claspedwith a rough plate of gold, and sustaining always a long knife,and, in some instances, a sword. From beneath their broad-brimmedhats of palm-leaf gleamed eyes which, even in good-natureand merriment, had a kind of animal ferocity. Theytransgressed, without fear or scruple, the rules of behavior thatwere binding on all others; smoking tobacco under the beadle'svery nose, although each whiff would have cost a townsman a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>shilling; and quaffing, at their pleasure, draughts of wine oraqua-vitæ from pocket-flasks, which they freely tendered to thegaping crowd around them. It remarkably characterized theincomplete morality of the age, rigid as we call it, that a licensewas allowed the seafaring class, not merely for their freaks onshore, but for far more desperate deeds on their proper element.The sailor of that day would go near to be arraigned as apirate in our own. There could be little doubt, for instance,that this very ship's crew, though no unfavorable specimens ofthe nautical brotherhood, had been guilty, as we should phraseit, of depredations on the Spanish commerce, such as wouldhave perilled all their necks in a modern court of justice.</p><p>But the sea, in those old times, heaved, swelled, and foamed,very much at its own will, or subject only to the tempestuouswind, with hardly any attempts at regulation by human law.The buccaneer on the wave might relinquish his calling, andbecome at once, if he chose, a man of probity and piety onland; nor, even in the full career of his reckless life, was heregarded as a personage with whom it was disreputable to traffic,or casually associate. Thus, the Puritan elders, in their blackcloaks, starched bands, and steeple-crowned hats, smiled notunbenignantly at the clamor and rude deportment of these jollyseafaring men; and it excited neither surprise nor animadversion,when so reputable a citizen as old Roger Chillingworth, thephysician, was seen to enter the market-place, in close andfamiliar talk with the commander of the questionable vessel.</p><p>The latter was by far the most showy and gallant figure, sofar as apparel went, anywhere to be seen among the multitude.He wore a profusion of ribbons on his garment, and gold-laceon his hat, which was also encircled by a gold chain, and surmounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>with a feather. There was a sword at his side, and asword-cut on his forehead, which, by the arrangement of hishair, he seemed anxious rather to display than hide. A landsmancould hardly have worn this garb and shown this face, andworn and shown them both with such a galliard air, withoutundergoing stern question before a magistrate, and probablyincurring fine or imprisonment, or perhaps an exhibition in thestocks. As regarded the shipmaster, however, all was lookedupon as pertaining to the character, as to a fish his glisteningscales.</p><p>After parting from the physician, the commander of the Bristolship strolled idly through the market-place; until, happening toapproach the spot where Hester Prynne was standing, he appearedto recognize, and did not hesitate to address her. As was usuallythe case wherever Hester stood, a small vacant area—a sort ofmagic circle—had formed itself about her, into which, thoughthe people were elbowing one another at a little distance, noneventured, or felt disposed to intrude. It was a forcible type ofthe moral solitude in which the scarlet letter enveloped its fatedwearer; partly by her own reserve, and partly by the instinctive,though no longer so unkindly, withdrawal of her fellow-creatures.Now, if never before, it answered a good purpose,by enabling Hester and the seaman to speak together withoutrisk of being overheard; and so changed was Hester Prynne'srepute before the public, that the matron in town most eminentfor rigid morality could not have held such intercourse with lessresult of scandal than herself.</p><p class="figright"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25344/25344-h/images/illu_287.jpg"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_287_th.jpg" alt="Chillingworth,—Smile with a sinister meaning" title="Chillingworth,—Smile with a sinister meaning"></a></p><p>“So, mistress,” said the mariner, “I must bid the stewardmake ready one more berth than you bargained for! No fearof scurvy or ship-fever, this voyage! What with the ship'ssurgeon and this other doctor, our only danger will be fromdrug or pill; more by token, as there is a lot of apothecary'sstuff aboard, which I traded for with a Spanish vessel.”</p><p>“What mean you?” inquired Hester, startled more than shepermitted to appear. “Have you another passenger?”</p><p>“Why, know you not,” cried the shipmaster, “that this physicianhere—Chillingworth, he calls himself—is minded to trymy cabin-fare with you?Ay, ay, you must haveknown it; for he tellsme he is of your party,and a close friend to thegentleman you spoke of,—hethat is in perilfrom these sour old Puritanrulers!”</p><p>“They know eachother well, indeed,” repliedHester, with amien of calmness, thoughin the utmost consternation.“They have long dwelt together.”</p><p>Nothing further passed between the mariner and Hester Prynne.But, at that instant, she beheld old Roger Chillingworth himself,standing in the remotest corner of the market-place, and smilingon her; a smile which—across the wide and bustling square,and through all the talk and laughter, and various thoughts,moods, and interests of the crowd—conveyed secret and fearfulmeaning.</p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; padding-top: 4em"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/ornament_iii.jpg" width="400" height="111" alt="" title=""></div><h2><a name="XXII" id="XXII"></a>XXII.</h2><h4>THE PROCESSION.</h4><div class="initial"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/initial_b.jpg" alt="B" title="B"></div><p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">efore</span> Hester Prynne could call together herthoughts, and consider what was practicableto be done in this new and startling aspectof affairs, the sound of military music washeard approaching along a contiguous street.It denoted the advance of the procession ofmagistrates and citizens, on its way towards the meeting-house;where, in compliance with a custom thus early established, andever since observed, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale was to deliver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>an Election Sermon.</p><div class="backleft" style="background-image: url(images/illu_289.jpg); height: 100%;"><div class="sandbag-left" style="width:400px; height:170px;"> </div><div class="sandbag-left" style="width:290px; height:120px;"> </div><p>Soon the head of the procession showed itself, with a slowand stately march, turning a corner, and making its way acrossthe market-place. First came the music. It comprised a varietyof instruments, perhaps imperfectly adapted to one another, andplayed with no great skill; but yet attaining the great objectfor which the harmony of drum and clarion addresses itself tothe multitude,—that of imparting a higher and more heroic airto the scene of life that passes before the eye. Little Pearl atfirst clapped her hands, but then lost, for an instant, the restlessagitation that had kept her in a continual effervescencethroughout the morning; she gazed silently, and seemed to beborne upward, like a floating sea-bird, on the long heaves andswells of sound. But she was brought back to her formermood by the shimmer of the sunshine on the weapons and brightarmor of the military company, which followed after the music,and formed the honorary escort of the procession. This bodyof soldiery—which still sustains a corporate existence, andmarches down from past ages with an ancient and honorablefame—was composed of no mercenary materials. Its rankswere filled withgentlemen, whofelt the stirringsof martial impulse,and soughtto establish akind of College of Arms, where, as in an association of KnightsTemplars, they might learn the science, and, so far as peacefulexercise would teach them, the practices of war. The highestimation then placed upon the military character might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>seen in the lofty port of each individual member of the company.Some of them, indeed, by their services in the Low Countriesand on other fields of European warfare, had fairly won theirtitle to assume the name and pomp of soldiership. The entirearray, moreover, clad in burnished steel, and with plumage noddingover their bright morions, had a brilliancy of effect whichno modern display can aspire to equal.</p></div><p>And yet the men of civil eminence, who came immediatelybehind the military escort, were better worth a thoughtfulobserver's eye. Even in outward demeanor, they showed a stampof majesty that made the warrior's haughty stride look vulgar,if not absurd. It was an age when what we call talent hadfar less consideration than now, but the massive materials whichproduce stability and dignity of character a great deal more.The people possessed, by hereditary right, the quality of reverence;which, in their descendants, if it survive at all, exists insmaller proportion, and with a vastly diminished force, in theselection and estimate of public men. The change may be forgood or ill, and is partly, perhaps, for both. In that old day,the English settler on these rude shores—having left king,nobles, and all degrees of awful rank behind, while still thefaculty and necessity of reverence were strong in him—bestowedit on the white hair and venerable brow of age; on long-triedintegrity; on solid wisdom and sad-colored experience; onendowments of that grave and weighty order which gives theidea of permanence, and comes under the general definition ofrespectability. These primitive statesmen, therefore,—Bradstreet,Endicott, Dudley, Bellingham, and their compeers,—who wereelevated to power by the early choice of the people, seem tohave been not often brilliant, but distinguished by a ponderous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>sobriety, rather than activity of intellect. They had fortitudeand self-reliance, and, in time of difficulty or peril, stood upfor the welfare of the state like a line of cliffs against a tempestuoustide. The traits of character here indicated were wellrepresented in the square cast of countenance and large physicaldevelopment of the new colonial magistrates. So far as ademeanor of natural authority was concerned, the mother countryneed not have been ashamed to see these foremost men of anactual democracy adopted into the House of Peers, or madethe Privy Council of the sovereign.</p><p>Next in order to the magistrates came the young and eminentlydistinguished divine, from whose lips the religious discourseof the anniversary was expected. His was the profession,at that era, in which intellectual ability displayed itself far morethan in political life; for—leaving a higher motive out of thequestion—it offered inducements powerful enough, in the almostworshipping respect of the community, to win the most aspiringambition into its service. Even political power—as in the caseof Increase Mather—was within the grasp of a successful priest.</p><p>It was the observation of those who beheld him now, thatnever, since Mr. Dimmesdale first set his foot on the NewEngland shore, had he exhibited such energy as was seen in thegait and air with which he kept his pace in the procession.There was no feebleness of step, as at other times; his framewas not bent; nor did his hand rest ominously upon his heart.Yet, if the clergyman were rightly viewed, his strength seemednot of the body. It might be spiritual, and imparted to himby angelic ministrations. It might be the exhilaration of thatpotent cordial, which is distilled only in the furnace-glow ofearnest and long-continued thought. Or, perchance, his sensitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>temperament was invigorated by the loud and piercing music,that swelled heavenward, and uplifted him on its ascending wave.Nevertheless, so abstracted was his look, it might be questionedwhether Mr. Dimmesdale even heard the music. There was hisbody, moving onward, and with an unaccustomed force. Butwhere was his mind? Far and deep in its own region, busyingitself, with preternatural activity, to marshal a procession ofstately thoughts that were soon to issue thence; and so he sawnothing, heard nothing, knew nothing, of what was around him;but the spiritual element took up the feeble frame, and carriedit along, unconscious of the burden, and converting it to spiritlike itself. Men of uncommon intellect, who have grown morbid,possess this occasional power of mighty effort, into which theythrow the life of many days, and then are lifeless for as manymore.</p><p>Hester Prynne, gazing steadfastly at the clergyman, felt adreary influence come over her, but wherefore or whence sheknew not; unless that he seemed so remote from her ownsphere, and utterly beyond her reach. One glance of recognition,she had imagined, must needs pass between them. Shethought of the dim forest, with its little dell of solitude, andlove, and anguish, and the mossy tree-trunk, where, sitting handin hand, they had mingled their sad and passionate talk withthe melancholy murmur of the brook. How deeply had theyknown each other then! And was this the man? She hardlyknew him now! He, moving proudly past, enveloped, as itwere, in the rich music, with the procession of majestic andvenerable fathers; he, so unattainable in his worldly position,and still more so in that far vista of his unsympathizingthoughts, through which she now beheld him! Her spirit sank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>with the idea that all must have been a delusion, and that,vividly as she had dreamed it, there could be no real bondbetwixt the clergyman and herself. And thus much of womanwas there in Hester, that she could scarcely forgive him,—leastof all now, when the heavy footstep of their approachingFate might be heard, nearer, nearer, nearer!—for being ableso completely to withdraw himself from their mutual world;while she groped darkly, and stretched forth her cold hands,and found him not.</p><p>Pearl either saw and responded to her mother's feelings, orherself felt the remoteness and intangibility that had fallenaround the minister. While the procession passed, the childwas uneasy, fluttering up and down, like a bird on the pointof taking flight. When the whole had gone by, she looked upinto Hester's face.</p><p>“Mother,” said she, “was that the same minister that kissedme by the brook?”</p><p>“Hold thy peace, dear little Pearl!” whispered her mother.“We must not always talk in the market-place of what happensto us in the forest.”</p><p>“I could not be sure that it was he; so strange he looked,”continued the child. “Else I would have run to him, and bidhim kiss me now, before all the people; even as he did yonderamong the dark old trees. What would the minister have said,mother? Would he have clapped his hand over his heart, andscowled on me, and bid me be gone?”</p><p>“What should he say, Pearl,” answered Hester, “save thatit was no time to kiss, and that kisses are not to be given inthe market-place? Well for thee, foolish child, that thou didstnot speak to him!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>”</p><p>Another shade of the same sentiment, in reference to Mr.Dimmesdale, was expressed by a person whose eccentricities—orinsanity, as we should term it—led her to do what few ofthe towns-people would have ventured on; to begin a conversationwith the wearer of the scarlet letter, in public. It wasMistress Hibbins, who, arrayed in great magnificence, with atriple ruff, a broidered stomacher, a gown of rich velvet, anda gold-headed cane, had come forth to see the procession. Asthis ancient lady had the renown (which subsequently cost herno less a price than her life) of being a principal actor in allthe works of necromancy that were continually going forward,the crowd gave way before her, and seemed to fear the touchof her garment, as if it carried the plague among its gorgeousfolds. Seen in conjunction with Hester Prynne,—kindly as somany now felt towards the latter,—the dread inspired by MistressHibbins was doubled, and caused a general movementfrom that part of the market-place in which the two womenstood.</p><p>“Now, what mortal imagination could conceive it!” whisperedthe old lady, confidentially, to Hester. “Yonder divineman! That saint on earth, as the people uphold him to be,and as—I must needs say—he really looks! Who, now, thatsaw him pass in the procession, would think how little while itis since he went forth out of his study,—chewing a Hebrewtext of Scripture in his mouth, I warrant,—to take an airingin the forest! Aha! we know what that means, Hester Prynne!But, truly, forsooth, I find it hard to believe him the sameman. Many a church-member saw I, walking behind the music,that has danced in the same measure with me, when Somebodywas fiddler, and, it might be, an Indian powwow or a Lapland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>wizard changing hands with us! That is but a trifle, when awoman knows the world. But this minister! Couldst thousurely tell, Hester, whether he was the same man that encounteredthee on the forest-path?”</p><p>“Madam, I know not of what you speak,” answered HesterPrynne, feeling Mistress Hibbins to be of infirm mind; yetstrangely startled and awe-stricken by the confidence with whichshe affirmed a personal connection between so many persons (herselfamong them) and the Evil One. “It is not for me totalk lightly of a learned and pious minister of the Word, likethe Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale!”</p><p>“Fie, woman, fie!” cried the old lady, shaking her finger atHester. “Dost thou think I have been to the forest so manytimes, and have yet no skill to judge who else has been there?Yea; though no leaf of the wild garlands, which they worewhile they danced, be left in their hair! I know thee, Hester;for I behold the token. We may all see it in the sunshine;and it glows like a red flame in the dark. Thou wearest itopenly; so there need be no question about that. But thisminister! Let me tell thee, in thine ear! When the BlackMan sees one of his own servants, signed and sealed, so shyof owning to the bond as is the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, hehath a way of ordering matters so that the mark shall be disclosedin open daylight to the eyes of all the world! What isit that the minister seeks to hide, with his hand always overhis heart? Ha, Hester Prynne!”</p><p>“What is it, good Mistress Hibbins?” eagerly asked littlePearl. “Hast thou seen it?”</p><p>“No matter, darling!” responded Mistress Hibbins, makingPearl a profound reverence. “Thou thyself wilt see it, one time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>or another. They say, child, thou art of the lineage of thePrince of the Air! Wilt thou ride with me, some fine night,to see thy father? Then thou shalt know wherefore the ministerkeeps his hand over his heart!”</p><p>Laughing so shrilly that all the market-place could hear her,the weird old gentlewoman took her departure.</p><p>By this time the preliminary prayer had been offered in themeeting-house, and the accents of the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdalewere heard commencing his discourse. An irresistible feelingkept Hester near the spot. As the sacred edifice was toomuch thronged to admit another auditor, she took up her positionclose beside the scaffold of the pillory. It was in sufficientproximity to bring the whole sermon to her ears, in the shapeof an indistinct, but varied, murmur and flow of the minister'svery peculiar voice.</p><p>This vocal organ was in itself a rich endowment; insomuchthat a listener, comprehending nothing of the language in whichthe preacher spoke, might still have been swayed to and fro bythe mere tone and cadence. Like all other music, it breathedpassion and pathos, and emotions high or tender, in a tonguenative to the human heart, wherever educated. Muffled as thesound was by its passage through the church-walls, HesterPrynne listened with such intentness, and sympathized so intimately,that the sermon had throughout a meaning for her,entirely apart from its indistinguishable words. These, perhaps,if more distinctly heard, might have been only a grosser medium,and have clogged the spiritual sense. Now she caught the lowundertone, as of the wind sinking down to repose itself; thenascended with it, as it rose through progressive gradations ofsweetness and power, until its volume seemed to envelop her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>with an atmosphere of awe and solemn grandeur. And yet,majestic as the voice sometimes became, there was forever in itan essential character of plaintiveness. A loud or low expressionof anguish,—the whisper, or the shriek, as it might beconceived, of suffering humanity, that touched a sensibility inevery bosom! At times this deep strain of pathos was all thatcould be heard, and scarcely heard, sighing amid a desolatesilence. But even when the minister's voice grew high andcommanding,—when it gushed irrepressibly upward,—when itassumed its utmost breadth and power, so overfilling the churchas to burst its way through the solid walls, and diffuse itself inthe open air,—still, if the auditor listened intently, and for thepurpose, he could detect the same cry of pain. What was it?The complaint of a human heart, sorrow-laden, perchance guilty,telling its secret, whether of guilt or sorrow, to the great heartof mankind; beseeching its sympathy or forgiveness,—at everymoment,—in each accent,—and never in vain! It was thisprofound and continual undertone that gave the clergyman hismost appropriate power.</p><p>During all this time, Hester stood, statue-like, at the foot ofthe scaffold. If the minister's voice had not kept her there,there would nevertheless have been an inevitable magnetism inthat spot, whence she dated the first hour of her life of ignominy.There was a sense within her,—too ill-defined to be made athought, but weighing heavily on her mind,—that her wholeorb of life, both before and after, was connected with this spot,as with the one point that gave it unity.</p><p>Little Pearl, meanwhile, had quitted her mother's side, andwas playing at her own will about the market-place. She madethe sombre crowd cheerful by her erratic and glistening ray;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>even as a bird of bright plumage illuminates a whole tree ofdusky foliage, by darting to and fro, half seen and half concealedamid the twilight of the clustering leaves. She had anundulating, but, oftentimes, a sharp and irregular movement. Itindicated the restless vivacity of her spirit, which to-day wasdoubly indefatigable in its tiptoe dance, because it was playedupon and vibrated with her mother's disquietude. WheneverPearl saw anything to excite her ever-active and wanderingcuriosity, she flew thitherward and, as we might say, seizedupon that man or thing as her own property, so far as shedesired it; but without yielding the minutest degree of controlover her motions in requital. The Puritans looked on, and, ifthey smiled, were none the less inclined to pronounce the childa demon offspring, from the indescribable charm of beauty andeccentricity that shone through her little figure, and sparkledwith its activity. She ran and looked the wild Indian in theface; and he grew conscious of a nature wilder than his own.Thence, with native audacity, but still with a reserve as characteristic,she flew into the midst of a group of mariners, theswarthy-cheeked wild men of the ocean, as the Indians were ofthe land; and they gazed wonderingly and admiringly at Pearl,as if a flake of the sea-foam had taken the shape of a littlemaid, and were gifted with a soul of the sea-fire, that flashesbeneath the prow in the night-time.</p><p>One of these seafaring men—the shipmaster, indeed, who hadspoken to Hester Prynne—was so smitten with Pearl's aspect,that he attempted to lay hands upon her, with purpose to snatcha kiss. Finding it as impossible to touch her as to catch ahumming-bird in the air, he took from his hat the gold chainthat was twisted about it, and threw it to the child. Pearl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>immediately twined it around her neck and waist, with suchhappy skill, that, once seen there, it became a part of her, andit was difficult to imagine her without it.</p><p>“Thy mother is yonder woman with the scarlet letter,” saidthe seaman. “Wilt thou carry her a message from me?”</p><p>“If the message pleases me, I will,” answered Pearl.</p><p>“Then tell her,” rejoined he, “that I spake again with theblack-a-visaged, hump-shouldered old doctor, and he engages tobring his friend, the gentleman she wots of, aboard with him.So let thy mother take no thought, save for herself and thee.Wilt thou tell her this, thou witch-baby?”</p><p>“Mistress Hibbins says my father is the Prince of the Air!”cried Pearl, with a naughty smile. “If thou callest me thatill name, I shall tell him of thee; and he will chase thy shipwith a tempest!”</p><p>Pursuing a zigzag course across the market-place, the childreturned to her mother, and communicated what the marinerhad said. Hester's strong, calm, steadfastly enduring spiritalmost sank, at last, on beholding this dark and grim countenanceof an inevitable doom, which—at the moment when apassage seemed to open for the minister and herself out oftheir labyrinth of misery—showed itself, with an unrelentingsmile, right in the midst of their path.</p><p>With her mind harassed by the terrible perplexity in whichthe shipmaster's intelligence involved her, she was also subjectedto another trial. There were many people present, from thecountry round about, who had often heard of the scarlet letter,and to whom it had been made terrific by a hundred false orexaggerated rumors, but who had never beheld it with theirown bodily eyes. These, after exhausting other modes of amusement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>now thronged about Hester Prynne with rude and boorishintrusiveness. Unscrupulous as it was, however, it could notbring them nearer than a circuit of several yards. At that distancethey accordingly stood, fixed there by the centrifugal forceof the repugnance which the mystic symbol inspired. The wholegang of sailors, likewise, observing the press of spectators, andlearning the purport of the scarlet letter, came and thrust theirsunburnt and desperado-looking faces into the ring. Even theIndians were affected by a sort of cold shadow of the whiteman's curiosity, and, gliding through the crowd, fastened theirsnake-like black eyes on Hester's bosom; conceiving, perhaps,that the wearer of this brilliantly embroidered badge must needsbe a personage of high dignity among her people. Lastlythe inhabitants of the town (their own interest in this worn-outsubject languidly reviving itself, by sympathy with whatthey saw others feel) lounged idly to the same quarter,and tormented Hester Prynne, perhaps more than all the rest,with their cool, well-acquainted gaze at her familiar shame.Hester saw and recognized the selfsame faces of that groupof matrons, who had awaited her forthcoming from the prison-door,seven years ago; all save one, the youngest and onlycompassionate among them, whose burial-robe she had sincemade. At the final hour, when she was so soon to fling asidethe burning letter, it had strangely become the centre of moreremark and excitement, and was thus made to sear her breastmore painfully, than at any time since the first day she putit on.</p><p>While Hester stood in that magic circle of ignominy, wherethe cunning cruelty of her sentence seemed to have fixed herforever, the admirable preacher was looking down from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>sacred pulpit upon an audience whose very inmost spirits hadyielded to his control. The sainted minister in the church!The woman of the scarlet letter in the market-place! Whatimagination would have been irreverent enough to surmise thatthe same scorching stigma was on them both!</p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; padding-top: 1em"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_048.jpg" width="400" height="149" alt="" title=""></div><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; padding-top: 4em"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/ornament_vii.jpg" width="400" height="109" alt="" title=""></div><h2><a name="XXIII" id="XXIII"></a>XXIII.</h2><h4>THE REVELATION OF THE SCARLET LETTER.</h4><div class="initial"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/initial_t.jpg" alt="T" title="T"></div><p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">he</span> eloquent voice, on which the souls ofthe listening audience had been borne aloftas on the swelling waves of the sea, atlength came to a pause. There was amomentary silence, profound as what shouldfollow the utterance of oracles. Then ensueda murmur and half-hushed tumult; as if the auditors,released from the high spell that had transported them into theregion of another's mind, were returning into themselves, withall their awe and wonder still heavy on them. In a momentmore, the crowd began to gush forth from the doors of thechurch. Now that there was an end, they needed other breath,more fit to support the gross and earthly life into which theyrelapsed, than that atmosphere which the preacher had convertedinto words of flame, and had burdened with the richfragrance of his thought.</p><p>In the open air their rapture broke into speech. The streetand the market-place absolutely babbled, from side to side, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>applauses of the minister. His hearers could not rest until theyhad told one another of what each knew better than he couldtell or hear. According to their united testimony, never hadman spoken in so wise, so high, and so holy a spirit, as hethat spake this day; nor had inspiration ever breathed throughmortal lips more evidently than it did through his. Its influencecould be seen, as it were, descending upon him, andpossessing him, and continually lifting him out of the writtendiscourse that lay before him, and filling him with ideas thatmust have been as marvellous to himself as to his audience.His subject, it appeared, had been the relation between the Deityand the communities of mankind, with a special reference to theNew England which they were here planting in the wilderness.And, as he drew towards the close, a spirit as of prophecyhad come upon him, constraining him to its purpose as mightilyas the old prophets of Israel were constrained; only with thisdifference, that, whereas the Jewish seers had denounced judgmentsand ruin on their country, it was his mission to foretella high and glorious destiny for the newly gathered people ofthe Lord. But, throughout it all, and through the whole discourse,there had been a certain deep, sad undertone of pathos,which could not be interpreted otherwise than as the naturalregret of one soon to pass away. Yes; their minister whomthey so loved—and who so loved them all, that he could notdepart heavenward without a sigh—had the foreboding ofuntimely death upon him, and would soon leave them in theirtears! This idea of his transitory stay on earth gave the lastemphasis to the effect which the preacher had produced; it wasas if an angel, in his passage to the skies, had shaken hisbright wings over the people for an instant,—at once a shadow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>and a splendor,—and had shed down a shower of golden truthsupon them.</p><p>Thus, there had come to the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale—asto most men, in their various spheres, though seldom recognizeduntil they see it far behind them—an epoch of life morebrilliant and full of triumph than any previous one, or thanany which could hereafter be. He stood, at this moment, onthe very proudest eminence of superiority, to which the giftsof intellect, rich lore, prevailing eloquence, and a reputation ofwhitest sanctity, could exalt a clergyman in New England's earliestdays, when the professional character was of itself a loftypedestal. Such was the position which the minister occupied,as he bowed his head forward on the cushions of the pulpit, atthe close of his Election Sermon. Meanwhile Hester Prynnewas standing beside the scaffold of the pillory, with the scarletletter still burning on her breast!</p><p>Now was heard again the clangor of the music, and themeasured tramp of the military escort, issuing from the church-door.The procession was to be marshalled thence to the town-hall,where a solemn banquet would complete the ceremonies ofthe day.</p><p>Once more, therefore, the train of venerable and majesticfathers was seen moving through a broad pathway of the people,who drew back reverently, on either side, as the Governorand magistrates, the old and wise men, the holy ministers, andall that were eminent and renowned, advanced into the midstof them. When they were fairly in the market-place, theirpresence was greeted by a shout. This—though doubtless itmight acquire additional force and volume from the childlikeloyalty which the age awarded to its rulers—was felt to be an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>irrepressible outburst of enthusiasm kindled in the auditors bythat high strain of eloquence which was yet reverberating in theirears. Each felt the impulse in himself, and, in the same breath,caught it from his neighbor. Within the church, it had hardlybeen kept down; beneath the sky, it pealed upward to thezenith. There were human beings enough, and enough ofhighly wrought and symphonious feeling, to produce that moreimpressive sound than the organ tones of the blast, or thethunder, or the roar of the sea; even that mighty swell ofmany voices, blended into one great voice by the universalimpulse which makes likewise one vast heart out of the many.Never, from the soil of New England, had gone up such ashout! Never, on New England soil, had stood the man sohonored by his mortal brethren as the preacher!</p><p>How fared it with him then? Were there not the brilliantparticles of a halo in the air about his head? So etherealized byspirit as he was, and so apotheosized by worshipping admirers,did his footsteps, in the procession, really tread upon the dustof earth?</p><p>As the ranks of military men and civil fathers moved onward,all eyes were turned towards the point where the minister wasseen to approach among them. The shout died into a murmur,as one portion of the crowd after another obtained a glimpseof him. How feeble and pale he looked, amid all his triumph!The energy—or say, rather, the inspiration which had heldhim up, until he should have delivered the sacred message thatbrought its own strength along with it from heaven—waswithdrawn, now that it had so faithfully performed its office.The glow, which they had just before beheld burning on hischeek, was extinguished, like a flame that sinks down hopelessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>among the late-decaying embers. It seemed hardly theface of a man alive, with such a death-like hue; it was hardlya man with life in him, that tottered on his path so nervelessly,yet tottered, and did not fall!</p><p>One of his clerical brethren,—it was the venerable JohnWilson,—observing the state in which Mr. Dimmesdale wasleft by the retiring wave of intellect and sensibility, steppedforward hastily to offer his support. The minister tremulously,but decidedly, repelled the old man's arm. He still walkedonward, if that movement could be so described, which ratherresembled the wavering effort of an infant, with its mother'sarms in view, outstretched to tempt him forward. And now,almost imperceptible as were the latter steps of his progress,he had come opposite the well-remembered and weather-darkenedscaffold, where, long since, with all that dreary lapse of timebetween, Hester Prynne had encountered the world's ignominiousstare. There stood Hester, holding little Pearl by the hand!And there was the scarlet letter on her breast! The ministerhere made a pause; although the music still played the statelyand rejoicing march to which the procession moved. It summonedhim onward,—onward to the festival!—but here hemade a pause.</p><p>Bellingham, for the last few moments, had kept an anxiouseye upon him. He now left his own place in the procession,and advanced to give assistance; judging, from Mr. Dimmesdale'saspect, that he must otherwise inevitably fall. But therewas something in the latter's expression that warned back themagistrate, although a man not readily obeying the vague intimationsthat pass from one spirit to another. The crowd, meanwhile,looked on with awe and wonder. This earthly faintness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>was, in their view, only another phase of the minister's celestialstrength; nor would it have seemed a miracle too high to bewrought for one so holy, had he ascended before their eyes,waxing dimmer and brighter, and fading at last into the lightof heaven.</p><p>He turned towards the scaffold, and stretched forth his arms.</p><p>“Hester,” said he, “come hither! Come, my little Pearl!”</p><p>It was a ghastly look with which he regarded them; butthere was something at once tender and strangely triumphant init. The child, with the bird-like motion which was one of hercharacteristics, flew to him, and clasped her arms about hisknees. Hester Prynne—slowly, as if impelled by inevitablefate, and against her strongest will—likewise drew near, butpaused before she reached him. At this instant, old RogerChillingworth thrust himself through the crowd,—or, perhaps,so dark, disturbed, and evil, was his look, he rose up out ofsome nether region,—to snatch back his victim from what hesought to do! Be that as it might, the old man rushed forward,and caught the minister by the arm.</p><p>“Madman, hold! what is your purpose?” whispered he.“Wave back that woman! Cast off this child! All shall bewell! Do not blacken your fame, and perish in dishonor! Ican yet save you! Would you bring infamy on your sacredprofession?”</p><p>“Ha, tempter! Methinks thou art too late!” answered theminister, encountering his eye, fearfully, but firmly. “Thypower is not what it was! With God's help, I shall escapethee now!”</p><p>He again extended his hand to the woman of the scarlet letter.</p><p>“Hester Prynne,” cried he, with a piercing earnestness, “in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>the name of Him, so terrible and so merciful, who gives megrace, at this last moment, to do what—for my own heavysin and miserable agony—I withheld myself from doing sevenyears ago, come hither now, and twine thy strength about me!Thy strength, Hester; but let it be guided by the will whichGod hath granted me! This wretched and wronged old man isopposing it with all his might!—with all his own might, and thefiend's! Come, Hester, come! Support me up yonder scaffold!”</p><p>The crowd was in a tumult. The men of rank and dignity,who stood more immediately around the clergyman, were sotaken by surprise, and so perplexed as to the purport of whatthey saw,—unable to receive the explanation which most readilypresented itself, or to imagine any other,—that they remainedsilent and inactive spectators of the judgment which Providenceseemed about to work. They beheld the minister, leaning onHester's shoulder, and supported by her arm around him,approach the scaffold, and ascend its steps; while still the littlehand of the sin-born child was clasped in his. Old RogerChillingworth followed, as one intimately connected with thedrama of guilt and sorrow in which they had all been actors,and well entitled, therefore, to be present at its closing scene.</p><p>“Hadst thou sought the whole earth over,” said he, lookingdarkly at the clergyman, “there was no one place so secret,—nohigh place nor lowly place, where thou couldst have escapedme,—save on this very scaffold!”</p><p>“Thanks be to Him who hath led me hither!” answered theminister.</p><p>Yet he trembled, and turned to Hester with an expression ofdoubt and anxiety in his eyes, not the less evidently betrayed,that there was a feeble smile upon his lips.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p><p>“Is not this better,” murmured he, “than what we dreamedof in the forest?”</p><p>“I know not! I know not!” she hurriedly replied. “Better?Yea; so we may both die, and little Pearl die with us!”</p><p>“For thee and Pearl, be it as God shall order,” said theminister; “and God is merciful! Let me now do the willwhich he hath made plain before my sight. For, Hester, I am adying man. So let me make haste to take my shame upon me!”</p><p>Partly supported by Hester Prynne, and holding one hand oflittle Pearl's, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale turned to the dignifiedand venerable rulers; to the holy ministers, who were hisbrethren; to the people, whose great heart was thoroughlyappalled, yet overflowing with tearful sympathy, as knowing thatsome deep life-matter—which, if full of sin, was full of anguishand repentance likewise—was now to be laid open to them.The sun, but little past its meridian, shone down upon the clergyman,and gave a distinctness to his figure, as he stood out fromall the earth, to put in his plea of guilty at the bar of EternalJustice.</p><p>“People of New England!” cried he, with a voice that roseover them, high, solemn, and majestic,—yet had always a tremorthrough it, and sometimes a shriek, struggling up out of afathomless depth of remorse and woe,—“ye, that have lovedme!—ye, that have deemed me holy!—behold me here, theone sinner of the world! At last!—at last!—I stand upon thespot where, seven years since, I should have stood; here, withthis woman, whose arm, more than the little strength wherewithI have crept hitherward, sustains me, at this dreadfulmoment, from grovelling down upon my face! Lo, the scarletletter which Hester wears! Ye have all shuddered at it! Wherever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>her walk hath been,—wherever, so miserably burdened, shemay have hoped to find repose,—it hath cast a lurid gleam ofawe and horrible repugnance round about her. But there stoodone in the midst of you, at whose brand of sin and infamy yehave not shuddered!”</p><p>It seemed, at this point, as if the minister must leave theremainder of his secret undisclosed. But he fought back thebodily weakness,—and, still more, the faintness of heart,—thatwas striving for the mastery with him. He threw off all assistance,and stepped passionately forward a pace before the womanand the child.</p><p>“It was on him!” he continued, with a kind of fierceness;so determined was he to speak out the whole. “God's eyebeheld it! The angels were forever pointing at it! The Devilknew it well, and fretted it continually with the touch of hisburning finger! But he hid it cunningly from men, and walkedamong you with the mien of a spirit, mournful, because so purein a sinful world!—and sad, because he missed his heavenlykindred! Now, at the death-hour, he stands up before you!He bids you look again at Hester's scarlet letter! He tellsyou, that, with all its mysterious horror, it is but the shadowof what he bears on his own breast, and that even this, his ownred stigma, is no more than the type of what has seared hisinmost heart! Stand any here that question God's judgment ona sinner? Behold! Behold a dreadful witness of it!”</p><p class="figcenter"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25344/25344-h/images/illu_311.jpg"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_311_th.jpg" alt="Shall we not meet again?" title="Shall we not meet again?"></a></p><p>With a convulsive motion, he tore away the ministerial bandfrom before his breast. It was revealed! But it were irreverent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>to describe that revelation. For an instant, the gaze ofthe horror-stricken multitude was concentred on the ghastly miracle;while the minister stood, with a flush of triumph in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>face, as one who, in the crisis of acutest pain, had won a victory.Then, down he sank upon the scaffold! Hester partly raisedhim, and supported his head against her bosom. Old RogerChillingworth knelt down beside him, with a blank, dull countenance,out of which the life seemed to have departed.</p><p>“Thou hast escaped me!” he repeated more than once.“Thou hast escaped me!”</p><p>“May God forgive thee!” said the minister. “Thou, too,hast deeply sinned!”</p><p>He withdrew his dying eyes from the old man, and fixedthem on the woman and the child.</p><p>“My little Pearl,” said he, feebly,—and there was a sweetand gentle smile over his face, as of a spirit sinking into deeprepose; nay, now that the burden was removed, it seemedalmost as if he would be sportive with the child,—“dear littlePearl, wilt thou kiss me now? Thou wouldst not, yonder, inthe forest! But now thou wilt?”</p><p>Pearl kissed his lips. A spell was broken. The great sceneof grief, in which the wild infant bore a part, had developed allher sympathies; and as her tears fell upon her father's cheek,they were the pledge that she would grow up amid humanjoy and sorrow, nor forever do battle with the world, but bea woman in it. Towards her mother, too, Pearl's errand as amessenger of anguish was all fulfilled.</p><p>“Hester,” said the clergyman, “farewell!”</p><p>“Shall we not meet again?” whispered she, bending her facedown close to his. “Shall we not spend our immortal lifetogether? Surely, surely, we have ransomed one another, withall this woe! Thou lookest far into eternity, with those brightdying eyes! Then tell me what thou seest?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>”</p><p>“Hush, Hester, hush!” said he, with tremulous solemnity.“The law we broke!—the sin here so awfully revealed!—letthese alone be in thy thoughts! I fear! I fear! It may be,that, when we forgot our God,—when we violated our reverenceeach for the other's soul,—it was thenceforth vain tohope that we could meet hereafter, in an everlasting and purereunion. God knows; and He is merciful! He hath provedhis mercy, most of all, in my afflictions. By giving me thisburning torture to bear upon my breast! By sending yonderdark and terrible old man, to keep the torture always at red-heat!By bringing me hither, to die this death of triumphantignominy before the people! Had either of these agonies beenwanting, I had been lost forever! Praised be his name! Hiswill be done! Farewell!”</p><p>That final word came forth with the minister's expiring breath.The multitude, silent till then, broke out in a strange, deep voiceof awe and wonder, which could not as yet find utterance, savein this murmur that rolled so heavily after the departed spirit.</p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px; padding-top: 1em"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_053.jpg" width="300" height="217" alt="" title=""></div><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; padding-top: 4em"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/ornament_iv.jpg" width="400" height="111" alt="" title=""></div><h2><a name="XXIV" id="XXIV"></a>XXIV.</h2><h4>CONCLUSION.</h4><div class="initial"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/initial_a.jpg" alt="A" title="A"></div><p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">fter</span> many days, when time sufficed for thepeople to arrange their thoughts in referenceto the foregoing scene, there was morethan one account of what had been witnessedon the scaffold.</p><p>Most of the spectators testified to havingseen, on the breast of the unhappy minister, a <small>SCARLET LETTER</small>—thevery semblance of that worn by Hester Prynne—imprintedin the flesh. As regarded its origin, there were various explanations,all of which must necessarily have been conjectural.Some affirmed that the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, on the veryday when Hester Prynne first wore her ignominious badge,had begun a course of penance,—which he afterwards, inso many futile methods, followed out,—by inflicting a hideoustorture on himself. Others contended that the stigma hadnot been produced until a long time subsequent, when oldRoger Chillingworth, being a potent necromancer, had caused itto appear, through the agency of magic and poisonous drugs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>Others, again,—and those best able to appreciate the minister'speculiar sensibility, and the wonderful operation of his spiritupon the body,—whispered their belief, that the awful symbolwas the effect of the ever-active tooth of remorse, gnawing fromthe inmost heart outwardly, and at last manifesting Heaven'sdreadful judgment by the visible presence of the letter. Thereader may choose among these theories. We have thrown allthe light we could acquire upon the portent, and would gladly,now that it has done its office, erase its deep print out of ourown brain; where long meditation has fixed it in very undesirabledistinctness.</p><p>It is singular, nevertheless, that certain persons, who werespectators of the whole scene, and professed never once to haveremoved their eyes from the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, deniedthat there was any mark whatever on his breast, more than ona new-born infant's. Neither, by their report, had his dyingwords acknowledged, nor even remotely implied, any, the slightestconnection, on his part, with the guilt for which HesterPrynne had so long worn the scarlet letter. According to thesehighly respectable witnesses, the minister, conscious that he wasdying,—conscious, also, that the reverence of the multitudeplaced him already among saints and angels,—had desired,by yielding up his breath in the arms of that fallen woman, toexpress to the world how utterly nugatory is the choicest ofman's own righteousness. After exhausting life in his effortsfor mankind's spiritual good, he had made the manner of hisdeath a parable, in order to impress on his admirers the mightyand mournful lesson, that, in the view of Infinite Purity, weare sinners all alike. It was to teach them, that the holiestamong us has but attained so far above his fellows as to discern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>more clearly the Mercy which looks down, and repudiatemore utterly the phantom of human merit, which would lookaspiringly upward. Without disputing a truth so momentous,we must be allowed to consider this version of Mr. Dimmesdale'sstory as only an instance of that stubborn fidelity withwhich a man's friends—and especially a clergyman's—will sometimesuphold his character, when proofs, clear as the mid-daysunshine on the scarlet letter, establish him a false and sin-stainedcreature of the dust.</p><p>The authority which we have chiefly followed,—a manuscriptof old date, drawn up from the verbal testimony of individuals,some of whom had known Hester Prynne, while others hadheard the tale from contemporary witnesses,—fully confirms theview taken in the foregoing pages. Among many morals whichpress upon us from the poor minister's miserable experience, weput only this into a sentence:—“Be true! Be true! Be true!Show freely to the world, if not your worst, yet some traitwhereby the worst may be inferred!”</p><p>Nothing was more remarkable than the change which tookplace, almost immediately after Mr. Dimmesdale's death, in theappearance and demeanor of the old man known as Roger Chillingworth.All his strength and energy—all his vital andintellectual force—seemed at once to desert him; insomuchthat he positively withered up, shrivelled away, and almostvanished from mortal sight, like an uprooted weed that lieswilting in the sun. This unhappy man had made the veryprinciple of his life to consist in the pursuit and systematicexercise of revenge; and when, by its completest triumph andconsummation, that evil principle was left with no further materialto support it, when, in short, there was no more Devil's work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>on earth for him to do, it only remained for the unhumanizedmortal to betake himself whither his Master would find himtasks enough, and pay him his wages duly. But, to all theseshadowy beings, so long our near acquaintances,—as well RogerChillingworth as his companions,—we would fain be merciful.It is a curious subject of observation and inquiry, whetherhatred and love be not the same thing at bottom. Each, inits utmost development, supposes a high degree of intimacyand heart-knowledge; each renders one individual dependentfor the food of his affections and spiritual life upon another;each leaves the passionate lover, or the no less passionatehater, forlorn and desolate by the withdrawal of his subject.Philosophically considered, therefore, the two passions seemessentially the same, except that one happens to be seen in acelestial radiance, and the other in a dusky and lurid glow.In the spiritual world, the old physician and the minister—mutualvictims as they have been—may, unawares, have foundtheir earthly stock of hatred and antipathy transmuted into goldenlove.</p><p>Leaving this discussion apart, we have a matter of businessto communicate to the reader. At old Roger Chillingworth'sdecease, (which took place within the year,) and by his lastwill and testament, of which Governor Bellingham and theReverend Mr. Wilson were executors, he bequeathed a veryconsiderable amount of property, both here and in England,to little Pearl, the daughter of Hester Prynne.</p><p>So Pearl—the elf-child,—the demon offspring, as somepeople, up to that epoch, persisted in considering her,—becamethe richest heiress of her day, in the New World. Not improbably,this circumstance wrought a very material change in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>public estimation; and, had the mother and child remainedhere, little Pearl, at a marriageable period of life, might havemingled her wild blood with the lineage of the devoutest Puritanamong them all. But, in no long time after the physician'sdeath, the wearer of the scarlet letter disappeared, and Pearlalong with her. For many years, though a vague report wouldnow and then find its way across the sea,—like a shapelesspiece of drift-wood tost ashore, with the initials of a name uponit,—yet no tidings of them unquestionably authentic werereceived. The story of the scarlet letter grew into a legend.Its spell, however, was still potent, and kept the scaffold awfulwhere the poor minister had died, and likewise the cottage bythe sea-shore, where Hester Prynne had dwelt. Near this latterspot, one afternoon, some children were at play, when theybeheld a tall woman, in a gray robe, approach the cottage-door.In all those years it had never once been opened; buteither she unlocked it, or the decaying wood and iron yieldedto her hand, or she glided shadow-like through these impediments,—and,at all events, went in.</p><p>On the threshold she paused,—turned partly round,—for,perchance, the idea of entering all alone, and all so changed,the home of so intense a former life, was more dreary and desolatethan even she could bear. But her hesitation was only foran instant, though long enough to display a scarlet letter on herbreast.</p><p class="figcenter"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25344/25344-h/images/illu_320.jpg"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_320_th.jpg" alt="Hester&#39;s Return" title="Hester&#39;s Return"></a></p><p>And Hester Prynne had returned, and taken up her long-forsakenshame! But where was little Pearl? If still alive, shemust now have been in the flush and bloom of early womanhood.None knew—nor ever learned, with the fulness of perfectcertainty—whether the elf-child had gone thus untimely toa maiden grave; or whether her wild, rich nature had beensoftened and subdued, and made capable of a woman's gentlehappiness. But, through the remainder of Hester's life, therewere indications that the recluse of the scarlet letter was theobject of love and interest with some inhabitant of another land.Letters came, with armorial seals upon them, though of bearingsunknown to English heraldry. In the cottage there were articlesof comfort and luxury such as Hester never cared to use, butwhich only wealth could have purchased, and affection have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>imagined for her. There were trifles, too, little ornaments,beautiful tokens of a continual remembrance, that must havebeen wrought by delicate fingers, at the impulse of a fond heart.And, once, Hester was seen embroidering a baby-garment, withsuch a lavish richness of golden fancy as would have raised apublic tumult, had any infant, thus apparelled, been shown toour sober-hued community.</p><p>In fine, the gossips of that day believed,—and Mr. SurveyorPue, who made investigations a century later, believed,—andone of his recent successors in office, moreover, faithfullybelieves,—that Pearl was not only alive, but married, andhappy, and mindful of her mother, and that she would mostjoyfully have entertained that sad and lonely mother at her fireside.</p><p>But there was a more real life for Hester Prynne here, inNew England, than in that unknown region where Pearl hadfound a home. Here had been her sin; here, her sorrow; andhere was yet to be her penitence. She had returned, therefore,and resumed,—of her own free will, for not the sternest magistrateof that iron period would have imposed it,—resumed thesymbol of which we have related so dark a tale. Never afterwardsdid it quit her bosom. But, in the lapse of the toilsome,thoughtful, and self-devoted years that made up Hester's life,the scarlet letter ceased to be a stigma which attracted theworld's scorn and bitterness, and became a type of somethingto be sorrowed over, and looked upon with awe, yet with reverencetoo. And, as Hester Prynne had no selfish ends, nor livedin any measure for her own profit and enjoyment, people broughtall their sorrows and perplexities, and besought her counsel, asone who had herself gone through a mighty trouble. Women,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>more especially,—in the continually recurring trials of wounded,wasted, wronged, misplaced, or erring and sinful passion,—orwith the dreary burden of a heart unyielded, because unvaluedand unsought,—came to Hester's cottage, demanding why theywere so wretched, and what the remedy! Hester comforted andcounselled them as best she might. She assured them, too, ofher firm belief, that, at some brighter period, when the worldshould have grown ripe for it, in Heaven's own time, a newtruth would be revealed, in order to establish the whole relationbetween man and woman on a surer ground of mutual happiness.Earlier in life, Hester had vainly imagined that sheherself might be the destined prophetess, but had long sincerecognized the impossibility that any mission of divine andmysterious truth should be confided to a woman stained withsin, bowed down with shame, or even burdened with a life-longsorrow. The angel and apostle of the coming revelationmust be a woman, indeed, but lofty, pure, and beautiful;and wise, moreover, not through dusky grief, but theethereal medium of joy; and showing how sacred love shouldmake us happy, by the truest test of a life successful to suchan end!</p><p>So said Hester Prynne, and glanced her sad eyes downwardat the scarlet letter. And, after many, many years, a newgrave was delved, near an old and sunken one, in that burial-groundbeside which King's Chapel has since been built. Itwas near that old and sunken grave, yet with a space between,as if the dust of the two sleepers had no right to mingle. Yetone tombstone served for both. All around, there were monumentscarved with armorial bearings; and on this simple slabof slate—as the curious investigator may still discern, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>perplex himself with the purport—there appeared the semblanceof an engraved escutcheon. It bore a device, a herald's wordingof which might serve for a motto and brief description ofour now concluded legend; so sombre is it, and relieved onlyby one ever-glowing point of light gloomier than the shadow:—</p><p class="center">“<span class="smcap">On a field, sable, the letter A, gules</span>.”</p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px; padding-top: 4em"><img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne_files/illu_323.jpg" width="150" height="163" alt="" title=""></div><p class="center" style="padding-top: 2em; font-size: 60%; text-indent: 0em">Cambridge: Electrotyped and Printed by Welch, Bigelow, &amp; Co.</p><div class="note"><h3>Transcriber's Notes</h3><p>Obvious printer's errors have been corrected; for the details, seebelow.
