This, my dear reader, is to show you how to escape from City 45.
I've been studying the Combine now from my window, and the units always, stands in the corner at
the southeastern peak (entrance to the Terminal) of the city. There is /however/ a way to distract the unit, big time.
What you need is three friends you trust, some stone, a radio (it shouldn't be be hard to get one) and a sharp object.

Alright, lets get back to the unit. In this particular case, it's always the same unit standing in the corner.
I've tested this unit for some days, sending my friend John Borhens to talk to the unit.

This is important: the citizen /must/ be deemed certain of his cause when talking to the unit.
Start with some questions, for example what time of the day it is - the unit will most likely just laugh and ignore you.
Regardless what he answers, just look at him and look stupid. If the unit finally says, 'move along', and then you'll have to reply;
'no, you move along'. Don't be too cocky, he will just beat you then, we don't want that. He will then ask you if you want to be beaten.
Just reply 'no' and walk away. The units aren't that imtimidating, it takes some time to realise that.

Now the reason why you should do this; you need to check the units patience, knowing when he will become angry and beat you. Simple.
Why you need the stones is simple. You need to practice how to kill animals in the 'outlands' with stones when there's nobody to protect
you anymore. The sharp object should be six-eight centimetres long, you need to attach it to your foot. Read this carefully now.
Make sure no other unit can see you.

Friend number one (or you) will have to go speak with the unit saying your friend is hurt.
Friend number two and three will then drag you (the one with most leg muscles).
You /must/ hide the knife, faking your leg is hurt, pull it up.

Make friend number one suddenly distract the unit, for example saying 'oh shit' making the unit looking at him.
Then you will have to /with all your strength/ put the knife in the leg of the unit and in the stomach until you feel certain the unit is dead.
Now you'll have to be real fast, since we almost got caught being slow. Grab the units radio, his stunstick and most importantly his gun and ammo
and run through the tracks for your life. Food? Eat as little as you can from the rations you get each day and stack up on them.
Do this until you feel certain you can live for atleast a month out there without feeling the need of hunting. However, you will have to.
Don't use the gun however, you will need this if Combine trackers would find you.

This is where the stonethrowing part enters the picture. Everyone will need to stack up on stones, big ones and overwhelm the target with stones.
Antlions have some meat, however they are hard to kill and they are often in groups. Crabs are easy to find and kill.
There are houses pretty much everywhere along the coastlines, or atleast shelters you can stay at. Make sure atleast one of you
scouts for food at /all/ times, and for incoming Combine trackers.

Hopefully this will help you, we're happy and alive.
