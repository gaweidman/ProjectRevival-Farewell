[10:55:44]	[LOOC] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: So it's a rubber seal that is apart of the door, i'm assuming you meant the actual vent door.
[10:55:53]	[LOOC] Joseph Kimsler: not the vent door, the metal plate
[10:55:57]	[LOOC] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: Oh
[10:55:59]	[LOOC] Joseph Kimsler: the sela is a part of the metal plate

[10:58:13]	[LOOC] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: With hazmats of course.

[10:58:23]	[LOOC] Joseph Kimsler: i don't see why not
[10:58:51]	[LOOC] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: And because this is area is filled with vents it would probably just vent out and we would be okay?
