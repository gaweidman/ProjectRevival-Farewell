[23:06:20]	[OOC] Ollie Garner: Huh. Question. Does CWU have something to do to earn tokens? Like, without setting up a shop n crap?

[23:07:25]	[OOC] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: or if nobody comes to the hospital
[23:07:37]	[OOC] Ollie Garner: Ah.

[23:08:35]	[OOC] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: vve totally allow both. CCA is fun because we're still growing our force, so promotions shouldn't be extremely hard to come by
[23:08:40]	[OOC] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: not that we give away DvL for free
[23:08:42]	[OOC] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: but you get what i mean
[23:09:22]	[OOC] Ollie Garner: Yeah. How serious is this server by the way? In terms of RP. Like, if I wanted to shoot at a rebel, would I have to exclaim it or some shit. I've seen... servers that do that.
[23:09:50]	[OOC] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: Well we try to be a bit different. I wouldn't call us extreme hardasses but I wouldn't go as far as calling it semi-serious either. Somewhere in-between.
[23:10:41]	[OOC] Ollie Garner: I see. I don't mind having to do things such as FearRP, PainRP, etc etc.

[23:11:28]	[OOC] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: Yeah, we do subscribe to those,  but also try to make sure it's not painfully boring. Like you get shot in your chest and you have to agonizingly roleplay exactly how you writhe on the ground in agony in a minimum of 500 words

[23:12:25]	[OOC] Ollie Garner: Yeah. Personally, I always enjoyed RP with mechanics in it. Not just text based with a screen of two characters staring at each other
[23:12:32]	[OOC] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: yeah honestly
[23:12:49]	[OOC] Ollie Garner: If I wanted that, I would just go to steam chat, or Amino or some other shit.
[23:12:49]	[OOC] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: combat in HL2RP is pretty cool but holy hell 90% of it is just staff arguing

[23:15:13]	[OOC] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: We do them en masse, normally whenever playercount is high, but we're having a bit of a dry spell
[23:15:20]	[OOC] Ollie Garner: Oof.
[23:15:33]	[OOC] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: so i may just kinda ping the discord like "oi, IC apps for CP, get yer asses on"

[23:16:28]	[OOC] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: but right now, just rations and work cycles
[23:16:30]	[OOC] Ollie Garner: Alrighty
[23:16:36]	[OOC] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: but i never considered that
[23:17:19]	[OOC] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: part of my little excuse is that we don't put too much of a bar on CWU, or at least not as much as other servers

[23:20:50]	[OOC] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: Yeah, at least that way you don't have to keep combing through your memory?

[23:21:29]	[OOC] Ollie Garner: Yeah. Are CP divisions something you perm stay in? A server I am maining right now allows you to switch Divisions when you need to cover a job. Don't have a JURY? Switch division.

[23:23:19]	[OOC] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: We're not huge on it, but if you're lower-ranked it shouldn't be as much of a problem. Part of that is that we make other units fill other roles if we have to. 
[23:23:46]	[OOC] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: so if there are no GRIDs online and a machine is broken, they either say "fuck it, who here knows the most about engineering", or just try to find another way to do what they're doing
