[02:18:53]	[OOC] Francis 'Watcher 2' Gatsby: I wanted to shape him into a good kid that didn't annoy everyone :/
[02:18:56]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: he ragequit and came back

[02:19:19]	[OOC] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: Yeah. It's rare to see that. I just hope that he doesn't look back on these memories as bad ones.
[02:19:22]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: if he decides to continue his path into virginity
[02:19:24]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: he won't

[02:23:47]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: yeah
[02:23:53]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: the SWRP server has taken a hit though

[02:24:07]	[OOC] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: Yeah. Honestly. I heard some... less than nice things about SWRP, so I never tried it myself
[02:24:13]	[OOC] Francis 'Watcher 2' Gatsby: I would love to try to be staff
[02:24:16]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: it's weird becuase most of them are darkrp
[02:24:19]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: darkrp-based
[02:24:21]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: but we do NS based
[02:24:22]	OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801 used command '/DoorSetHidden true'.
[02:24:25]	[OOC] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: Huh.
[02:24:31]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: it's like this serious but a little less since it's PvE
[02:24:33]	[OOC] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: whats with all the offline people in your server haha, we would have 40+ people on if those people would play
[02:24:38]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: my goal is to grow into a multi-server network the likes of lifepunch
[02:24:43]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: yeah, it's because
[02:24:45]	[OOC] Francis 'Watcher 2' Gatsby: Also I've probably put 3000+ into swrp

[02:24:49]	[OOC] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: Honestly, mil sim just never got to me as much as genuine RP does.
[02:24:55]	OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801 has gained 40 tokens.
[02:25:09]	[OOC] Francis 'Watcher 2' Gatsby: I'm sticked with this one SWRP server called Project renegade for 3 years and Its a good experince
[02:25:13]	[OOC] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: Like this. Sure CP is kinda Mil Sim, but it's in such a diffrent way.
[02:25:36]	[OOC] Francis 'Watcher 2' Gatsby: Then again I'm usually always in the NCO ranks and never below or abovce
[02:25:39]	[OOC] Francis 'Watcher 2' Gatsby: *above
[02:25:45]	[OOC] Francis 'Watcher 2' Gatsby: I'm always stuck in NCO
[02:25:51]	[OOC] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: It's a lot more actiony and not just getting yelled at by some asshole who plays nothing but that server all day and night.
[02:25:52]	[OOC] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: all neb CP's are edgy
[02:26:14]	[OOC] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: I mean, sure, you might get yelled at by a higher CP, but it's usually for a good reason
[02:26:49]	[OOC] Francis 'Watcher 2' Gatsby: I exported the death clip for Arno and I'll upload it as unlisted and show y'all 
[02:26:58]	[OOC] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: Nice.

[02:27:16]	[OOC] Francis 'Watcher 2' Gatsby: Like its Arno dying and thinking back on old memories. I actually put it together nicely
[02:27:25]	[OOC] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: how did Arno die again?
[02:27:33]	[OOC] Francis 'Watcher 2' Gatsby: I was afk and gunned down
[02:27:37]	[OOC] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: OOF.

[02:28:26]	[OOC] Francis 'Watcher 2' Gatsby: I was a Office guy doing office things
[02:28:35]	[OOC] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: Ah, so far it's been my main server. It's honestly super fun. It's... not based on DarkRP, I think
[02:28:39]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: they had some good stuff programmed in. crazy good polish
[02:28:54]	[OOC] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: It works sorta similar though. But yeah. The server has a pretty good AMS system n shit
[02:29:12]	[OOC] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: Nice Xen portal, and recently they are making a new map based on BM:S
[02:29:23]	[OOC] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: oo that reminds me
[02:29:30]	[OOC] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: someday we should have a portal storm event
[02:29:38]	[OOC] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: Yeah. That could be cool
[02:29:40]	[OOC] Francis 'Watcher 2' Gatsby: Oh?

[02:29:58]	[OOC] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: Probably would... have to be a climax to some big event plotline tho
[02:29:59]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: just for fun
[02:30:09]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: shit was cool. it's where i get my beta knowldege from

[02:30:16]	[OOC] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: just say the portal closed up or something
[02:30:21]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: keeps things cool and events non-shitty stuff
[02:30:34]	[OOC] Francis 'Watcher 2' Gatsby: If you have writing time you should write a state of affairs kinda how Nebolous did it. I liked reading it and getting a feel for it
[02:30:38]	[OOC] Francis 'Watcher 2' Gatsby: Setting the vibe
[02:30:38]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: non-shitty generic "oh no antlions are here what the fuck do we do"
[02:30:49]	[OOC] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: Yeah. I do recommend a few mini events here and there tho ngl. 
[02:30:55]	[OOC] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: When things get slow mostlyt
[02:30:56]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: yeah
[02:31:09]	[OOC] Francis 'Watcher 2' Gatsby: Q? Mini events? WHAT A COMEDIAN
[02:31:11]	[OOC] Francis 'Watcher 2' Gatsby: THIS GUY
[02:31:13]	[OOC] Francis 'Watcher 2' Gatsby: LMAO
[02:31:19]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: i like doing events but part of it is it's hard to think of ones that involve both rebels and combine without going "hmmmm, rebels get guns and invade nexus"
[02:31:20]	OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801 used command '/DoorSetHidden true'.
[02:31:21]	[OOC] Francis 'Watcher 2' Gatsby: Knee slapper
[02:31:22]	[OOC] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: THE ONLY EVENTS ARE MASS EVENTS! MAUHAUHAUAHHA
[02:31:25]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: swrp events I can do really well
[02:31:28]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: butr
[02:31:29]	OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801 used command '/DoorSetHidden true'.
[02:31:35]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: HL2RP events, for some reason i have a mental block
[02:31:51]	[OOC] Francis 'Watcher 2' Gatsby: Just replay the HL2 games for a bit 
[02:31:52]	[OOC] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: But either way, recently in that BMRP server, my character got hired by the G-Man. He wasn't put in stasis because that would not be fun. But fucking... He occasinally shows up during events, always congratulating me on a job well done. 
[02:31:58]	[OOC] Francis 'Watcher 2' Gatsby: Or play games
[02:32:01]	[OOC] Francis 'Watcher 2' Gatsby: Get inspiration 
[02:32:23]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: tru
[02:32:27]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: that's what i do for SWRP events
[02:32:30]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: but back to campaigns
[02:32:35]	[OOC] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: Possible mini event idea, mechanical shell failure. Somewhere in the city, probably in 404 zones or some shit, a shell could drop due to a malfunction
[02:32:36]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: that whole AEX thing was supposed to be a long series of events
[02:32:50]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: for weeks
[02:32:51]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: but
[02:32:56]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: then we saw how poorly received i17 is
[02:33:02]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: so we were like "OKAY OVERDRIVE TIME"
[02:33:05]	[OOC] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: Ah.
[02:33:08]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: like our last SWRP campaign took... a month?
[02:33:10]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: or so
[02:33:11]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: no

[02:33:13]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: like twoish

[02:33:42]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: long story short, an inquisitor comes ont othe ISD, getse stationed, wants to learn more aobut the dark side, learns about the old sith order, wants to reform it, thinks the emprie is doingsith shit and ruling wrong
[02:33:56]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: he quietly gets some stormtroopres on his side, takes over the ISD, and then he's defeated
[02:34:12]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: so i like doing campoaigns

[02:35:42]	[OOC] Francis 'Watcher 2' Gatsby: lmao
[02:35:48]	[OOC] Francis 'Watcher 2' Gatsby: In this time of certain death, Arno looks back on his memories with his only friend, Jimmy, that he shortly before getting killed yelled at and talked behind his back, and now as he gets gunned down all he can think of is his friend, Jimmy heat.
[02:35:53]	[OOC] Francis 'Watcher 2' Gatsby: Also thats the Desc.
[02:36:00]	[OOC] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: Possible idea if you think a event is going slow or just isn't progressing. If a stalemate ever occurs, combine could call in supplies from a diff city, and rebels might have to try to intercept so they can get it and nother the Combine. Also, F.
[02:36:25]	[OOC] Francis 'Watcher 2' Gatsby: I sen that unlisted video to all 3 of you

[02:38:32]	[OOC] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: Thanks. I just think there should be possible "mini events" that aid a side depending on who succeeds. I worry that things can get slow on this server due to lack of people
[02:38:38]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: for sure
[02:38:40]	[OOC] OTA.C17-NOVA.i5.26801: i agree
