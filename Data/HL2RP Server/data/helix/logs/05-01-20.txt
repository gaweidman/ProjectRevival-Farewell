[03:48:33]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: "Does this patient REALLY need their liver? Like honestly?"

[03:49:02]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: And uh, here is this nice Cremator head I got. Don't ask how. Or why.
[03:49:21]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: calling it now, you're going to make a magic eight ball out of a cremator's head
[03:49:34]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: when GRID and HELIX work together only the best products are made.,
[03:49:35]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: There is the fuckin perfect prop for it
[03:49:41]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: what prop is that
[03:49:53]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: The jar one. If I could spawn it, I would
[03:49:57]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: oh yeah that one
[03:50:07]	CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182 has spawned 'models/props_lab/crematorcase.mdl'.
[03:50:11]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Yup
[03:50:13]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: this prop is so cool
[03:50:14]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: i love it
[03:50:20]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: because it means cremators are canon
[03:50:24]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: and i fucking love cremators
[03:50:45]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Indeed. I kinda love the idea they might be "outdated" in a way. Fuckin scary to think what could be a new cremator

[03:51:19]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: holy shit what if they changed the beta concept to spray out, instead of a corrosive beam or whatever the shit
[03:51:26]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: it's like the microHID from secret lab
[03:51:29]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: but with combine dark energy
[03:51:35]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Oh god. 
[03:51:44]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: like it sprays out Combine energy ball shit

[03:51:53]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: You can fuckin spray in this gamemode?
[03:52:00]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: unfortunately.
[03:52:00]	CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182 used command '/DoorSetHidden true'.

[03:52:08]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: i *THOUGHT* i fxied it
[03:52:12]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: but no i didn't
[03:52:18]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: i do it accidentally so much
[03:52:29]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: but i have sprays disabled for whatever reason so i have no clue where sprays are
[03:52:38]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: i could walk past goatse on a daily basis and have no clue
[03:52:56]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Oof. Maybe see if you can restrict it to civis in a way. So they can make rebel insignias or some shit
[03:53:01]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: yeah
[03:53:11]	[OOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: i know in clockwork you could only use sprays if you had the spray can item
[03:53:17]	[OOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: that or that was a plugin or something
[03:53:21]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: either way, cool idea
[03:53:21]	[OOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Huh.
[03:53:34]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: i've always wanted an item where you could custom write your own text wtih spray paint
[03:53:37]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: like on walls
[03:53:50]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: that gets saved past restarts
[03:53:55]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Yeah. I know there is a mod for a spraycan I see sometimes used on RP servers.
[03:53:59]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: i'm sure it's beyond possible but i'm not good enough at programming
[03:54:03]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Or well addon.
[03:54:10]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: OH YEAH there is a spray can addon isn't there
[03:54:46]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Yeah. hell, you can probably use WIRE mod for that shit. In Impulse, people made a Lambda Symbol using the sign shit
[03:55:01]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: i wish wiremod was able to be saved between restarts
[03:55:07]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: we could do such cool shit with it
[03:55:09]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Oof.
[03:55:16]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: maybe it is and i'm just fucking stupid
[03:55:21]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: there's a very good chance that's true
[03:55:28]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Adv Dupe 2 does exist for a reason tho!
[03:55:30]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: but genuinely we could do some really cool shit with it
[03:55:32]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: true, true

[04:02:34]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Yeah.
[04:02:39]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: we hardly have high ranking metropolice
[04:02:42]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: if we grow to like
[04:02:43]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: way bigger
[04:02:47]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: we'd totally include it
[04:02:56]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Oof. Quesition, how many HELIXs are there? Active ones, I mean.
[04:03:00]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Uh.
[04:03:04]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: One.
[04:03:09]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: And that's semi-active.
[04:03:11]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: I don't think I EVER seen a HELIX on here.
[04:03:21]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: oof.
[04:03:25]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: the player who uses it is active, but he hasn't gotten on his HELIX in a while
[04:03:33]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: before the map change he used it a lot
[04:03:39]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: then the whole rebellion thing happened
[04:03:44]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: and we're still working on encouraging cityRP
[04:03:44]	CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182 used command '/DoorSetHidden true'.
[04:03:50]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: that reminds me, i owe his HELIX a promotion to i4
[04:04:02]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Ah. I see. Personally, I'm going to try my best on halfing my time as a Rebel and halfing my time as a CP
[04:04:08]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: that's good
[04:04:16]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: that's what we want from our rebels
[04:04:24]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: understanding of the need for BALANCE
[04:04:33]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Like, if there's only one or two rebels on, I'm goin CP for sure
[04:04:41]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: yeah, totally
[04:05:05]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: shit i had something kind of important
[04:05:11]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Oh, yikes.
[04:05:21]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: eh whatever. if it's important it'll come back to me
[04:05:27]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Aight
[04:05:42]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: I REMEMBER

[04:05:58]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: it?*

[04:08:08]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: damn daniel already starting off with those lies
[04:09:20]	[ME] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: would nod a bit, listening.
[04:10:00]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: literally one word in that entire explanation was true
[04:10:03]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: maybe two
[04:10:54]	CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182 has gained 10 tokens.

[04:12:18]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: so basically it's a tradeoff
[04:12:27]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: either you have the option to go rogue but you get promoted slower
[04:12:36]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: or you can't go rogue but you get promotions faster

[04:19:41]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: yeah, the guide
[04:19:45]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Yee
[04:19:49]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: yeah
[04:20:14]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: obviously that's not our bible because we let citizens swear and apply to the CWU and get into the CCA sans loyalist points, all that stuff
[04:20:24]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: but we go off of the offense and punishment list
[04:20:26]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: and the radio codes
[04:20:33]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: that's really all you need to know there
[04:20:39]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Yeah. I kinda thought it would be shitty-ish to not let em curse.

[04:21:10]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Towards a officer is the only time I would probably enforce it. At least if used aggresively
[04:21:27]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: yeah, but at that point you could consider it harassment of an officer anyways

[04:21:49]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Yeah
[04:22:14]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: uh one more thing
[04:22:26]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: you're with it so i shouldn't need to mention this
[04:22:28]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: but just in case i do
[04:22:34]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: autonomous judgment here
[04:22:37]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: does not mean deploying OTA
[04:22:45]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: it means killing all the citizens
[04:22:50]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Alright
[04:22:56]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: i know some servers have done that
[04:23:03]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: where it means deploying OTA
[04:23:05]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: but not here
[04:23:22]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Yeah. Tbf, this is the first serious HL2RP I actually got into
[04:23:32]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: So I don't have much to go off of
[04:23:36]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: ah, alright
[04:23:43]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: well another disclaimer then
[04:23:53]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: some servers will call JW every time a unit dies
[04:23:57]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: but that's not what we do
[04:24:04]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Ah. Do you do reasons?
[04:24:12]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: reasons?
[04:24:16]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: I know Impulse does it with reasons. Need three reasons
[04:24:21]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: oh that's fair
[04:24:23]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: three reasons
[04:24:28]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Four dead CPs count as a reason, a dead OTA is a reason, etc etc
[04:24:47]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: it's really just kinda handled by how HC feels about it. If there are a lot of CPs dying, or like, two OfCs are assassinated
[04:24:49]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: that sort of tihng
[04:24:50]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Basically signs of a possible uprising.
[04:24:53]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: yeah
[04:25:06]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: we don't call JW every time a unit is killed, unless it's like, either multiple policide or like a pretty high ranking unit dying
[04:25:13]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: normally it's just unrest procedure
[04:25:28]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: I'm guessing it is called in if a big ass rebel base is found? Since that's what it seemed like during my first JW in the server

[04:25:59]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: i wouldn't consider that a reason to call one as long as the situation is under control
[04:26:07]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Ah.
[04:26:16]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: but if the base evacuates and the combine finds out they evacuated, or they lose control of the situation somehow
[04:26:26]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: then it'd be JW or unrest
[04:26:29]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: andif they fight back
[04:26:31]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Ah, aight.
[04:26:32]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: JW

[04:26:52]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: according to HL2 lore you can call autonomous in certain regions
[04:27:02]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: like when you're in the canals you can hear the autonomous judgment voiceline
[04:27:24]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: but city 17 is still fine on the inside we assume, so we assume they can call it in certain districts or whatever the hell
[04:27:34]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Yeah
[04:27:42]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: trying to think of anything else
[04:28:01]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: I mean, I can always ask quesitons later if something I don't know comes up
[04:28:09]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: yeah totally
[04:28:12]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: oh shit uh
[04:28:16]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: bit of a biggish thing
[04:28:31]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: low ranks can't call a ration cycle
[04:28:42]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: only EpU+
[04:28:46]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Okay.
[04:28:51]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: we'll probably adjust that to i1+ or something
[04:29:08]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: and then units aren't allowed to patrol the slums or sewers alone.
[04:29:21]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: if you do and you get killed, tough fuckin titties
[04:29:39]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: we might make it so that it's a blackmark or a PK, that way it'll get through their heads
[04:30:02]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: What will qualify as a PK? 
[04:30:19]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: to be honest, it's a pretty blurred line. it's declared by staff on a case by case basis
[04:30:30]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: NPC-based deaths are almost never PK
[04:30:49]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Okay. So, let's say I get killed by a rebel player during a JW or something, will that count as a PK?
[04:30:54]	CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182 has gained 10 tokens.
[04:31:00]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: no
[04:31:12]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: until you get to a significant rank
[04:31:19]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: where's there's a specific number of people in that rank
[04:31:19]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Okay. 
[04:31:28]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: like if the DvL dies, it's a PK
[04:31:44]	CCA.C08-RCT.33698 has gained 10 tokens.
[04:31:45]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: If you get PKed, will you have to go through in char apps again?
[04:31:47]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: but if an i5-i1 gets killed, it's fine because they're disposable and shouldn't really fear for their life

[04:32:10]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: the only way you have to go through apps again is by getting dewhitelisted entirely
[04:32:13]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Nice. I'm guessing you'll be back at i5 or some shit
[04:32:16]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: yep
[04:32:20]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Oof.
[04:32:34]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: if we're real assholes we'd make them attend training again
[04:32:52]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: as unfair as it is to rebels, we have this sort of combine death dominance policy
[04:33:03]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: where metropolice are trained to believe and know they're disposable
[04:33:10]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: so they go into combat fearless
[04:33:33]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: thus when they die, it's not surprising. But if every death for combine is a PK, they won't be fearless or act like they know they're disposable
[04:33:42]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Alright. Are OTAs similar? Just asking incase if this character ever becomes a OTA.
[04:34:19]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: OTAs are similar. I cannot think of an instance where an OTA would be PKed.
[04:34:32]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: but keep in mind there can always be exceptions that come up
[04:34:43]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: there could be some circumstance where an i4 gets PKed or an OTA does

[04:34:52]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: but 99% of the time that's how it'll go
[04:34:54]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Okay. I always kinda hoped that. Since OTAs are supposed to essentially be the "same" character every time.
[04:34:59]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: yeah
[04:35:06]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: we do OTA a bit differently than most servers

[04:35:53]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: not that we allow them to be buddy buddy, but they can have at least a bit of a personality.

[04:37:31]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Oof. Also, ngl, I think it's kinda dumb when people say that the soldiers are saying Sorry to Alyx. I always imagined it was them saying Sorry to Overwatch or some shit. Showing how brainwashed they are.
[04:37:50]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: saying sorry to alyx? i assume that's some HL:Alyx shit i don't know about
