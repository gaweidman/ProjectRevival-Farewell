[15:46:39]	[LOOC] UU-SeC.08: we do our rank structure a bit different. We have EpU come before OfC, so it goes EpU, OfC, SqL, DvL
[15:47:09]	[LOOC] UU-SeC.08: you start out in union, and in order to get into helix or grid you need to do certification from an EpU or higher
[15:47:25]	[LOOC] UU-SeC.08: you're given study books if you tell a higher up that you're interested in grid or helix
[15:47:51]	[LOOC] UU-SeC.08: to get into judge you have to be selected, kinda like how it be with OTA
[15:48:13]	[LOOC] UU-SeC.08: obviously as you would expect judge is sentencing, jail wardening, interrogation, you already know

[16:12:28]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.98240: Yee
[16:12:33]	[LOOC] UU-SeC.08: it's the same reason we don't have secretaries to the administrator and all that bureaucracy

[16:14:12]	[LOOC] UU-SeC.08: for now, HELIX, JUDGE, UNION, GRID
[16:14:15]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.98240: Perhaps let's not put to many divisions in just like walter said.
[16:14:19]	[LOOC] UU-SeC.08: yeah
[16:14:26]	[LOOC] UU-SeC.08: we don't want too many with our playerbase rn
[16:15:02]	[LOOC] UU-SeC.08: PHANTOM isn't around anymore because we got rid of it as a donator perk. we have... 4 people with phantom. anyone else who donates that same amount gets hunter and the attrib boost
[16:15:06]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.98240: Hopefully we get roughly the player base we had yesterday consistantly.
[16:15:12]	[LOOC] UU-SeC.08: i'm praying
[16:15:18]	[LOOC] UU-SeC.08: anyways
[16:15:45]	[LOOC] UU-SeC.08: to get into GRID or HELIX you have to undergo certification under the division's EpU+
[16:16:01]	[LOOC] UU-SeC.08: if you show interest in either of those a higher up will provide you with study material
[16:16:09]	[LOOC] UU-SeC.08: to get into judge you need to show exceptional performance
[16:16:32]	[LOOC] UU-SeC.08: in the shit JUDGE does. you get selected like you do for OTA. Same stuff
[16:16:41]	[LOOC] UU-SeC.08: jail wardening, sentencing, interrogation, yadda yadda

[16:16:59]	[LOOC] UU-SeC.08: at i5
[16:17:13]	[LOOC] UU-SeC.08: so before i continue what division were you gonna go for lightroom
[16:17:30]	[LOOC] UU-SeC.08: you don't have to decide rn, you can just say union for now
[16:17:56]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-RCT.98240: I used to be a pretty decent GRID on a old server so I was thinkin GRID.
[16:18:03]	[LOOC] UU-SeC.08: ight
