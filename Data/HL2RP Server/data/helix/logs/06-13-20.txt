[00:00:35]	[LOOC] James Albright: also having asshole characters comes naturally because i get stressed and it's a good outlet if i'm being honest
[00:00:53]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.98240 [X]: Lmao, Is that why you're GRID is so vulgar towards me?
[00:01:10]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.98240 [X]: Not that I mind it's just kinda funny

[00:02:51]	[LOOC] James Albright: you mean like garbage? i agree
[00:03:18]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.98240 [X]: The fact that he's rather kind to like Ethan but is mean to any unit is so fuckin funny to me.
[00:04:04]	[LOOC] James Albright: to be fair he has to be nice to ethan or ethan will shut the fuck down
[00:04:17]	[LOOC] James Albright: to the sectorial, ethan is the key to this whole fucking portal because he thinks the rebels caused the fuckin portal
[00:04:40]	[LOOC] James Albright: so he wants to make him feel sepcial and comfortable so he can get all the info he can
[00:04:47]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.98240 [X]: Yeah I understand, Although Ethan doesn't know much about it so Ethans probably fucked.
[00:05:09]	[LOOC] James Albright: but i'd be lying if i said the sectorial wasn't getting a little attached. not in like a crazty strong way, but he's becoming a bit more comfortable with him

[00:07:23]	[LOOC] James Albright: i will say, i like the idea of union washing vs memory replacement. at first i wasn't sure. i was kinda iffy becuase new things are bad

[00:08:35]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.98240 [X]: Yee, I'm just hoping when you decide to do something that will really change something with Ethan I'm just hoping he doesn't die. I rather like Ethan compared to other chars.
[00:08:43]	James Albright used command '/ToggleRaise'.
[00:08:47]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.98240 [X]: Debatably I like 98240 better...

[00:09:30]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.98240 [X]: I know, I'm not gonna say fuck the Universal Union to the SeC and think I'm not gonna die

[00:09:47]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.98240 [X]: Please do...
[00:09:58]	[LOOC] James Albright: i think what' funny is that in the story, you would imagine ethan is the good guy
[00:10:03]	[LOOC] James Albright: just trying to live
[00:10:11]	[LOOC] James Albright: but he isn't
[00:10:25]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.98240 [X]: He's just trying to do what expands his lifespan pretty much
[00:10:26]	[LOOC] James Albright: there really isn't a good guy

[00:10:36]	[LOOC] James Albright: there's neutral and there's bad

[00:11:51]	[LOOC] James Albright: oh, no, it is a compliment
[00:11:57]	[LOOC] James Albright: it's captivating
[00:12:12]	[LOOC] James Albright: and there's something relaly human about that. like you would like to imagine yourself as the person who would be on the front lines
[00:12:15]	[LOOC] James Albright: fuckin dying for earth
[00:12:25]	[LOOC] James Albright: but when push ocmes to shove, who's to say that kind of thing wouldn't be you

[00:13:34]	[LOOC] James Albright: it's like the combine assassin
[00:13:42]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.98240 [X]: yeah, Other units can do their job
[00:13:45]	[LOOC] James Albright: from an OOC perspective, in the idea of the world, it makes sense why it exists
[00:13:56]	[LOOC] James Albright: sorry, from an IC perspective i mean
[00:14:11]	[LOOC] James Albright: but when you narrow that down to OOC and the context of the server, it's unneccesary
[00:14:25]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.98240 [X]: Yeah, It's just filler pretty much.
[00:14:26]	[LOOC] James Albright: "Veteran units, responsible for maintaining standards in the CCA. Their duties include information gathering, high-profile interrogations, political conscription, and handpicked tasks from their superiors."
[00:14:29]	[LOOC] James Albright: i mean
[00:14:30]	[LOOC] James Albright: that's cool
[00:14:46]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.98240 [X]: Yeah but, Isn't that just a high rank UNION?
[00:15:14]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.98240 [X]: UNION kind does all of that (Unless I'm stupid)
[00:15:17]	[LOOC] James Albright: from what i understand, they're kinda like if ghost wasn't painfully fucking edgy
