[22:50:38]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: i say that because it's absurd, in character, to sell an hour long filter

[22:52:14]	[LOOC] Maria North: gotcha!
[22:53:40]	[ME] Maria North: shakes her head, the stuffiness of her gasmask causes her to turn and sneeze.. though she tries to stifle it. She sniffs and looks back. 'Yeah, why did these come so dusty?' She goes to rub her nose.. then realizes well.. that's absolutely pointless.
[22:53:58]	[IT] Maria North: She can't itch it.. now she's annoyed. 'Anyways, thanks.. for the help. All of it. It's a lot but, adapt or die I guess?'
