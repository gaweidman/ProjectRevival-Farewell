[17:35:26]	[LOOC] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: q and the staff are just learning still, i can tell. Compared to Nebulous, they have a looong way to go
[17:36:03]	[LOOC] Journey Robertson: Yeah, but the problem with Nebulous is that it doesn't really care for the individual player...which sucks ass in my opinion.
[17:36:13]	[LOOC] Journey Robertson: I respect the server.
[17:36:19]	[LOOC] Journey Robertson: And what it's done
[17:36:21]	[LOOC] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: yeah, its more of an item grinding play style
