[14:41:38]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: so you have to clock in once every however long, and if you don't clock in after [x] amount of time, you lose your store
[14:41:44]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: so people in commerce don't just get a store

[14:41:50]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: and the store is taken forever

[14:42:38]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: yeah

[14:43:00]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: not the branch but the field
[14:43:35]	[LOOC] Kane Davis: I'm going to try and devote my character Jagraj to the CWU at some point soon.

[14:46:45]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: affirmative
[14:47:49]	[LOOC] Kane Davis: Yea I think we should make a locked discord channel and access to that channe means you're in the Union and on the roster, but it's up to the user how active their schedule and work logs are.
[14:48:12]	[LOOC] Kane Davis: more schedule and work logs = more benefits of something
[14:49:06]	[LOOC] Kane Davis: I'd say LP cause it's work for the betterment of the Combine system
[14:49:15]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: yeah
[14:50:20]	[LOOC] Kane Davis: I'd like to see either 1 LP given by a CCA in game or 1 LP given after CWU director approves the work log
[14:50:33]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: hmm, interesting idea

[14:51:48]	[LOOC] Kane Davis: if thsat makes sense
[14:52:55]	[LOOC] Kane Davis: I can see a CCA unit/division of some type working directly with the CWU to observe city general maintenence.
[14:53:22]	[LOOC] Kane Davis: like yesterday I did a check of building plumbing and a CCA unit observed the work then /viewdata logged it I think.
[14:53:28]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: see that's a great idea, but i have a counter offer: The City Bureaucracy
[14:53:38]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: city bureaucracy roleplay there would be pretty cool too imo
[14:53:55]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: and considering the CWU is an office of the CA
[14:53:57]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: it would make sense
[14:54:29]	[LOOC] Kane Davis: wym like... just like, jobs under the CA like an office?

[14:57:03]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: yknow how you have- wait no bad example
[14:57:09]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: hold on let me think
[14:57:35]	[LOOC] Kane Davis: Like you want the CWU to adhere more to the CA 
[14:57:44]	[LOOC] Kane Davis: and have other infastuctures under the Ca
[14:57:54]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: the CWU already does adhere to the CA as written in the guide
[14:58:32]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: the CWU is, in server canon, an organization created and executively run by the CA
[14:58:36]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: am i making any sense
