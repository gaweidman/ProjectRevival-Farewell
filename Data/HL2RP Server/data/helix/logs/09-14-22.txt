[23:05:41]	[OOC] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: because you can use them in chat but when you send the command, it actually gets sent in IC chat
[23:05:53]	[OOC] Alex Palovichov: Ah okay

[23:06:56]	[OOC] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: when you're dioing ULX stuff in the console, you can run your commands by just putting the name of the command after "ulx "

[23:08:47]	[OOC] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: the chat shows command descriptions as you type them as you're aware from regular, non-staff stuffw

[23:10:08]	[OOC] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: i like to hide loot around usually but i'd prefer if you clear loot spawning with us while you're in trialmod
