[11:55:33]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: hot looking vort
[11:55:39]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: yee. New models 
[11:55:48]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: Coulda done some crazy colors
[11:56:02]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Pink vortigaunts would be puke.
[11:56:10]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: yeah
[11:56:25]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: Just decided grey vort with orange eyes would probably we best
[11:56:34]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Wait, Black vortigaunt? GANGSTER VORTIGAUNT?
[11:56:52]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: Idk what that would look like. Probably terrible
[11:57:07]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Yep, anyways
[11:57:14]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: I'm waiting for my Conscript whitelist.
[11:57:18]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: ah
[11:57:23]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: very good
[11:57:34]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Gonna try to do a rogue one, if I manage.
[11:57:56]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: That would be interesting. You just have to make sure in RP you ain't tethered or tracked by the combine
[11:58:07]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Yeah.
[11:58:21]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: Like, I would try to escape, but the stuff I have on tracks me and restricts me so
[11:58:28]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: no point if I just die 
[11:58:53]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Well, I'll probably stay as a conscript until I reach Corporal.
[11:59:20]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: yee. The vort swep looks interesting
[11:59:23]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: has lots of stuff
[11:59:55]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Yeah, all resistances in the server are non-existent or weak.
[12:00:01]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: one of the abilties is literally X-ray
[12:00:16]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: I can see through walls and shit and know the health of the enemy
[12:00:24]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Hacks fr fr
[12:01:01]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: only issue when I escape is that I probably will need to think smart. Kinda hard. Because overwatch do be randomly coming out onto that beach
[12:01:34]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: It's hard to find a safe place to stay, most of us are wanderers when it comes to rebelRP.
[12:02:14]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: Yeah. I know of a spot I was told was a big no no because I just came across in randomly. They said I don't know. I was just clicking e and found it lol
[12:02:46]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: I thought the spot was pretty good to. Ill have to get invited into it I suppose
[12:03:04]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: I'll probably find a secret spot through doing random things like scavenging.
[12:03:14]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: So it won't be considered meta.
[12:03:17]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: yee
[12:03:57]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: Do overwatch log memories when they die? So they can keep coming? Or do they just have NLR like everyone else
[12:04:07]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Most likely log memories.
[12:04:15]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: I feel like thats a little OP
[12:04:21]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: And unfair for resistance fighters
[12:04:45]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: I understand they can't "die"... But they should not be able to come wave after wave unless they escape and report it.
[12:04:57]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: but I guesss thats what the jammer is for
[12:05:01]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: so they can't report it
[12:05:04]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Eh, I have a whole discord server set up incase I manage to form a resistance of sorts, though it will take a ton of time.
[12:05:27]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: Well... vortigaunts are always willing to escape and murder combine so
[12:05:40]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Well, some are just loners.
[12:05:49]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: yee. Its how they survive
[12:05:57]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: yummy antlion meat.
[12:06:01]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: yummy headcrab meat.
[12:06:04]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: I don't need to eat or drink
[12:06:16]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: literally don't need oxygen 
[12:06:22]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: bruh
[12:06:24]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: lucky.
[12:06:26]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: I can last on the sheer will of the vortesince
[12:06:43]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: Its so nice not having to where A god damn rebreather 24/7
[12:06:48]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: wear*
[12:07:06]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Hm, I've been wondering on what the resistance's name should be.
[12:07:24]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: just name it after some achievement the group makes
[12:07:32]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: don't give it a name until then
[12:07:49]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: Besides, If you gain norteriety early on, you become a big target
[12:08:09]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce:  The first one I thought of was "The White Ravens" but now I'm thinking of naming it "The Freedom Coalition"
[12:08:27]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Hm, but yeah.
[12:08:54]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: It's gonna be a pain getting a mental trigger so I can go rogue though.
[12:09:12]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: is the military treated?
[12:09:20]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: I thought it was only metro
[12:09:22]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Yeah, all armed forces of the combine are.
[12:09:26]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: hm
[12:09:37]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: Well tbf your character can have a slavery background
[12:09:41]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: they bam.
[12:09:46]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: you see me, it makes you mad.
[12:10:07]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: So like, my character is insane (Kind of) right
[12:10:13]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: And they hallucinate this dude.
[12:10:19]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Randomly.
[12:10:40]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: The dude comes up to me, (Close and personal) and begins whispering some shit into my ears.
[12:11:09]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: honestly, believeable because they literally took guys out of mental hostipitals and recruited them
[12:11:20]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: *3650* cough cough
[12:11:33]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Nobody icly even knows that my guy is insane.
[12:11:38]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: He acts normal infront of people.
[12:12:11]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: so I would imagine that it would go something like this :
[12:12:23]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: One regular day, my char once again hallucinates that figure.
[12:12:47]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: The figure whispers something into the man's ears that makes him go insane and bang his head into the wall
[12:13:02]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: (In this case it would be, say. His past. )
[12:13:16]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Then, the man wakes up.
[12:13:31]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: He's changed, reminded of who he is, who he once was.
[12:13:43]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: I don't know, but what do you think?
[12:14:34]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: Interesting. Something has to intitially trigger the event of being insane though
[12:15:02]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Yeah, though the characters hallucinations happen at random at the moment.
[12:15:39]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: yee. If I escape, Ima see If I can just kill some antlions and then just carve the armor off them and just attach to myself using the vortesence
[12:16:10]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: Since I don't necessarily need to use human crafting for that. I can just use funny magic.
[12:16:16]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Well, I wonder if vorts can free themselves.
[12:16:32]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Under the right circumstances
[12:16:33]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: Doubt it. the collars probably will fucking try to kill me if I do
[12:16:40]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Yeah, probably.
[12:17:03]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: Ik one boi has a master key that im hoping he will use eventually and just completely release the shackles
[12:17:31]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Hm, what's that? 
[12:18:03]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: basically, it opens any combine door, lock, and releases vorts from there shackles
[12:18:08]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: its literally a masterkey
[12:18:41]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: pretty OP.
[12:18:43]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: He could literally walk into the central tower and raid the armory if he wanted to
[12:19:02]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Though, does he just
[12:19:05]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Uhh
[12:19:12]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: press a button or something and the shackles release
[12:19:24]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: idk. Never seen it. Probably. 
[12:19:33]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Anyways, that's pretty OP.
[12:19:50]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: yee. Its an event item. He almost got caught, but he stashed it before he got searched
[12:20:15]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Though I wonder what the proccess would be of doing it, a more simple way.
[12:20:56]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: im assuming he probably just has to hold the key up to my collar and it has some magnetic combine thing and it will release the shackles
[12:21:05]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: thats the only way I could think of it.
[12:21:17]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Right, but like how would you do it without a key?
[12:21:44]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: probably would have to have a combine genetic code and or literally use a buzz saw and cut them off
[12:21:58]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: or another vort would zap and overload them.
[12:22:15]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: I think you would start off with the tracker chip
[12:22:26]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: which is probably implanted in your neck or somethin
[12:22:55]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: I could find it using the vortesence once im released
[12:23:02]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: its probably apart of the colalr
[12:23:32]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Well if it's in the neck, then I would probably extract it and drop it off somewhere, not destroyed though
[12:24:05]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: well id have to be careful with extracting it. I would probably just smash it or disable it if its inside me
[12:24:09]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: safer bet
[12:24:31]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: I can see that there are wires on you, so they might be important.
[12:24:45]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: yee. 
[12:25:28]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: they are probably strong enough to withstand vortigaunt claw sstrike though
[12:25:44]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Perhaps.
[12:26:07]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: I wonder if there are any free vortigaunts in this server though
[12:26:12]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: no
[12:26:24]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: even the owners character is enslaved
[12:26:29]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: well
[12:27:07]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: I would be the first. Probably try to survive to elder. Because I was talking with him about vortigaunts and what bonuses they get for reaching higher titles
[12:27:27]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: like a vortigaunt elder should be able to kick any combine that comes up to him
[12:27:45]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Man, freeing vortigaunts is such a sweaty and risky job.
[12:27:57]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: Yeah. But they can heal and give you valuable intel
[12:28:07]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Or, make friends.
[12:28:08]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: Super useful for fighting
[12:28:20]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: they can also power anything
[12:28:32]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: so ressistance basess basically have an infinite source of power
[12:28:44]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Well, almost I would say
[12:29:09]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: Yee. Vorts get tired, but they still can power batteries and recharge them with vortesence energy
[12:29:30]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Man, it's exciting to imagine large scale battles in the city
[12:29:43]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: oh yeah. It would be all out chaos. 
[12:30:32]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Wanna hear a funny story of when I fought combine soldiers in a hl2rp server?
[12:30:37]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: sure
[12:30:44]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: So, I was once with my mate, right.
[12:31:01]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: We saved up a ton of TNT, and then eventually detonated it on a combine hardpoint
[12:31:24]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: After killing a couple CPs, OTA came in and we retreated to our base in the sewers.
[12:31:40]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: After we killed a couple normal soldiers and stuff
[12:31:51]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: 2 elite OTA  units assaulted the base
[12:31:55]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: However
[12:32:03]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: I thought of a big brain move
[12:32:23]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: While both my mates and the elites were focused on each other
[12:32:34]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: I did a huge flank
[12:32:40]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: And then when the time came
[12:32:48]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: I came in and killed the 2 OTA elites instantly.
[12:33:04]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: best decision of my life.
[12:33:14]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: yee. BRB>
[12:33:21]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: brb aswell
[12:34:16]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: bacc
[12:43:17]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: bac
[12:43:42]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Anyways.
[12:44:01]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: I hope Q gets on so I can get the whitelist.
[12:44:09]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: Yeah. Hopefully.
[12:48:34]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: I really wonder, what map would be on if this city would be destroyed
[12:48:43]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: im unsure.
[12:48:52]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: God, typos.
[12:49:13]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Well, this is just an industrial city, supplying guns and stuff to the combine
[12:49:23]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: yes. I got voicelines now
[12:49:30]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: Hm.
[12:49:38]	[LOOC] Nathan Pierce: *Good for you*
[12:49:54]	[LOOC] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: I have never heard him say that
