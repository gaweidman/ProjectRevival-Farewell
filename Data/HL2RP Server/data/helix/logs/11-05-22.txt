[10:23:01]	[OOC] Jacob Desmone: so
[10:23:05]	[OOC] Jacob Desmone: if you roll a 95
[10:23:07]	[OOC] Jacob Desmone: you roll a 100
[10:23:13]	[OOC] Jacob Desmone: if you roll a 5 you roll a 0
[10:23:22]	[OOC] Jacob Desmone: so you get a bigger window for critical success and failure
[10:23:23]	[OOC] Jack Kingston: Does a 100 count as a critical?
[10:23:25]	[OOC] Jacob Desmone: Yea
[10:24:06]	[OOC] Jack Kingston: I wouldn't say thats bad, especially if that means you get a much better hit or you do the action you wanted to do better than expected
[10:24:31]	[OOC] Jacob Desmone: Yea
[10:25:07]	[OOC] Jack Kingston: If you roll a 5 or below sure its a critical fail but at that point you might have as well rolled a 1 since there is no way you are winning that contest anyway
[10:25:30]	[OOC] Jacob Desmone: yea
