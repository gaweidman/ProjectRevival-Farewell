As it melts, he would scrape the slag and other impurities from the top of it, dumping it to the appropriate location. As it purifies, he pours the molten liquid into the ingot mold, letting it cool. Once cooled, he would take the tongs and set the bars to the side to let them cool further.

[18:06:10]	[ME] Gregory: leaps into the air, landing in the comforts of his rectangular footlocker. The chumtoad quickly flips around on its back, wriggling around for a few moments before dozing off. The foul beast known as Gregory is pleased with the current events, and shall refrain from inciting his wrath upon this world, for they are not ready. Gregory must slumber, though he will return, for Gregory is a deific being of unimaginable power, or at least that's what he likes to believe. In reality, Gregory is no more than a teleporting chumtoad capable of bringing himeslf back from certain death, able to avoid the eternal slumber, for Gregory does not want to return to the void.
