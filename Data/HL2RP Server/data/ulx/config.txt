ulx rslotsMode 1 
ulx rslots 2
ulx rslotsVisible 1 ; When this is 0, sv_visiblemaxplayers will be set to maxplayers - slots_currently_reserved
;Modes:
;0 - Off
;1 - Keep # of slots reserved for admins, admins fill slots.
;2 - Keep # of slots reserved for admins, admins don't fill slots, they'll be freed when a player leaves.
;3 - Always keep 1 slot open for admins, kick the user with the shortest connection time if an admin joins.

;Difference between 1 and 2:
;I realize it's a bit confusing, so here's an example.
;On mode 1--
;	You have maxplayers set to 10, rslots set to 2, and there are currently 8 non-admins connected.
;	If a non-admin tries to join, they'll be kicked to keep the reserved slots open. Two admins join
;	and fill the two reserved slots. When non-admins leave, the two admins will still be filling the
;	two reserved slots, so another regular player can join and fill the server up again without being
;	kicked by the slots system

;On mode 2--
;	Same setup as mode 1, you have the two admins in the server and the server is full. Now, when a
;	non-admin leaves the server, reserved slots will pick up the slot again as reserved. If a regular
;	player tries to join and fill the server again, even though there are two admins connected, it will
;	kick the regular player to keep the slot open

;So, the basic difference between these two is mode 1 will subtract currently connected admins from the slot
;pool, while mode 2 while always be attempting to reclaim slots if it doesn't currently have enough when
;players leave no matter how many admins are connected.

;rslotsVisible:
;	If you set this variable to 0, ULX will automatically change sv_visiblemaxplayers for you so that if
;	there are no regular player slots available in your server, it will appear that the server is full.
;	The major downside to this is that admins can't connect to the server using the "find server" dialog
;	when it appears full. Instead, they have to go to console and use the command "connect <ip>".
;	NOTE THIS DOES NOT CHANGE YOUR MAXPLAYERS VARIABLE, ONLY HOW MANY MAXPLAYERS IT _LOOKS_ LIKE YOUR
;	SERVER HAS. YOU CAN NEVER, EVER HAVE MORE PLAYERS IN YOUR SERVER THAN THE MAXPLAYERS VARIABLE.
