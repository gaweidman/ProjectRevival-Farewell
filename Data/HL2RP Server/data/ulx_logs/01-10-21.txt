[10:50:25] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: .// Are you trying to say that the door is being held up by the rubber seal?
[10:50:28] Joseph Kimsler: /it The seal goes up to the wall and is a part of the plate. That means something, but your roll shows that you're not too positive what, you may have to think about it.

[10:50:43] Joseph Kimsler: .//no, like the seal isn't epoxied between the two

[10:56:34] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: .// But it's kinda fucky.

[10:57:45] Joseph Kimsler: .//it seems like it's through the metal, but you can't say to what extent it is

[10:59:25] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: /me Stabs his knife into the rubber bit, trying to see how deep it goes.
[11:00:08] Joseph Kimsler: t/it It's hard to tell exactly, because the seal is very tight to the wall. It really only goes around the metal plate.
