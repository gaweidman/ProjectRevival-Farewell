[00:03:04] Jason Delly: He was talking about how the combine was corrupt of course i never listened
[00:03:05] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.69192: Gave us a combat knife and says he's got info.
[00:03:15] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: A combat knife?
[00:03:17] Jason Delly: He gave us all knifes and too us to the sewers
[00:03:22] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.69192: Yeah. CCA issue from first glance.
[00:03:24] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Hm
[00:03:27] Jason Delly: They shot combine along the way
[00:03:33] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Think he was keeping it until we actually grabbed him?
[00:03:38] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.69192: Didn't get a good look it but combat knives aren't super common.
[00:03:40] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.22767: Where did they take you to the sewers from?
[00:03:42] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.69192: No, he handed it over.
[00:03:47] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Ah
[00:03:48] Jason Delly: The industrial section
[00:03:58] Jason Delly: There is a little vent in a building
[00:04:16] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.69192: Yeah. This oughta be interesting.
[00:04:21] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.22767: District 4 was locked off during those events, they would have had to taken you through another hole

[00:04:57] Jason Delly: Theres a little vent in the ruble the leads to the sewers
[00:04:58] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Think this "Theban" guy will be a real threat?
[00:04:59] Jason Delly: We went there
[00:05:09] Jason Delly: I also saw one of those slave things along the way
[00:05:09] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.69192: Could be if this guy isn't off his rocker.
[00:05:14] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.22767: Green?
[00:05:17] Jason Delly: The Vo-
[00:05:19] Jason Delly: Yea
[00:05:25] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.69192: If "caused it all" actually means something and isn't some weird babbling.
[00:05:30] Jason Delly: He was shooting beams
[00:05:36] Jason Delly: Strangest thing ever
[00:05:38] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.69192: I'm hoping it'll be.
[00:05:49] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Caused it all...think this connects to the GRID bay incident?
[00:06:19] Jason Delly: Thats all I didnt go in the sewers but I got a couple more names
[00:06:20] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.69192: Could be. I heard something about xen infestation I think, maybe he brought in the one contamination that couple of times.
[00:06:22] Jason Delly: One was micheal
[00:06:30] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Maybe....
[00:06:33] Jason Delly: And theban revolt
[00:06:35] Jason Delly: All i remember

[00:08:25] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.69192: /w So it's in D2 and has *access* to the sewers. That means it's a building in D2?
[00:08:37] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.22767: It's by the rubble he says

[00:10:01] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.22767: Alright, due to the seriousness of these claims you will need to provide satisfactory evidence.
[00:10:07] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: // This is actually cool RP, because knowing that we have a Vort and some fucking "mastermind" rebel behind shit is horrifying to the CCA.

[00:36:26] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: Don't have to wipe, get to clean up alien mess, get to sleep all the time.
[00:36:30] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: Best choice I made./
[00:36:37] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: I see
[00:36:59] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: I would imagine you guys aren't really cut out for QrM work, makes sense of course.
[00:37:14] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: It's nowhere near the same thing.
[00:37:20] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Affirmative
[00:38:03] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Being a QrM requires you to do tedious stocking and what not while being a OTA requires you to shoot rebels and be a walking killing machine.
[00:38:12] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Of course I love being a QrM.
[00:39:00] Klaudiusz Olszewski: // well at least this will make for a fun event

[00:39:35] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: of course you can say being transhumanized is a trade.
[00:39:47] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: Good trade.
[00:39:51] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Do you want your humanity or do you want to be a walking killing machine that can't really age all that much?
[00:40:00] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: Humanity is a strong word.
[00:40:06] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: We're still human, we're just loyal as shit.
[00:40:22] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: Lower rankers give it too much grap.
[00:40:23] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: I mean......do you really have all that much humanity left in you?
[00:40:24] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: .//crap*
[00:40:34] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: I understand you have some of it.
[00:40:47] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: But far less than I or most ground units would have.
[00:41:16] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: I would say OWC's are around a JUDGE OfC's level of humanity, atleast from what i've seen.
[00:41:19] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: Again, it's not like you're losing your humanity.
[00:41:25] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: So what. you're a bit less animated. Big whoop.
[00:41:31] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Fair enough
[00:41:46] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: I've worked with OWS units.
[00:41:49] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: You think they don't feel?
[00:41:50] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: Yeah right.
[00:42:05] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: But I doubt they would ever not shoot a person if they were ordered to.
[00:42:10] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: Hell no.
[00:42:12] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: Neither would I.
[00:42:19] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: That's the "humanity" part.
[00:42:21] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Which is that false sense of humanity that plenty of rebels love to bring up.
[00:42:40] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Humanity to rebels is not following orders and allowing terrorist and anarchist to live.
[00:42:51] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: Yeah.
[00:42:57] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Most rebels ignore that they themselves have killed plenty of good people just as we have.
[00:43:04] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: It's not like we don't have free will.
[00:43:19] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: You take antidepressants and aren't depresssed, you're still a human being.
[00:43:25] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Yep
[00:44:01] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: That fucking grid bay incident was a obvious showing that rebels aren't always supposed to be perfect and the "last hope of humanity" or whatever.
[00:45:01] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Those were good men who were fucking murdered by some ass hats who got greedy.
[00:45:05] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: Yeah.
[00:45:12] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: Just because they couldn't accept something good.
[00:45:16] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: That's what I don't get.
[00:45:21] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: This isn't the MR speaking, either.
[00:45:24] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: Even when I was a unit.

[00:45:39] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: You get what I mean.
[00:45:54] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: They say, "Oh no, big ol space aliens!! Oh no!!"
[00:46:08] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: They probably don't want to give up their old ways.
[00:46:09] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: "They must be evil because it's new!"
[00:46:11] OTA.C14-ECHO.OWC.51602: Yeah.

[00:54:08] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: I can agree with that
[00:54:10] Cave Johnson: It's not like it's garbage food.
[00:54:20] Cave Johnson: Reminds me of slim jim.
[00:54:26] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.22767: Oh
[00:54:31] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Slim Jim? I didn't have those all that often.
[00:54:33] Cave Johnson: Hey JUDGE, have a seat.
[00:54:46] Cave Johnson: Between you and me, I kept them next to the whiskey in my desk.
[00:54:51] Cave Johnson: Back at aperture.
[00:54:52] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: haha
[00:55:22] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Can I say, you are probably one of the best city adminstrators in my opinion, atleast from my perspective.

[00:55:34] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: .// ?*
[00:55:35] Cave Johnson: You don't get a promotion by being a kissass, pal.
[00:55:39] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: I am fully aware
[00:55:43] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Just saying my mind
[00:55:44] Cave Johnson: Well, in that case.
[00:55:45] Cave Johnson: Thanks.
[00:55:46] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.22767: I would agree
[00:55:48] Cave Johnson: Means a lot.
[00:55:52] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Also I can't get promotions in the first place.
[00:55:54] Cave Johnson: It's not exactly aperture, but it does well.
[00:56:08] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.22767: Our past administrators have been all business
[00:56:10] Cave Johnson: Different.
[00:56:14] Cave Johnson: I'm not?
[00:56:24] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.22767: You bring more life to the cities
[00:56:27] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: You are a little less serious and hard to talk to.
[00:56:34] Cave Johnson: Yeah. Have you met the secretary?
[00:56:46] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.22767: Once I believe
[00:56:53] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Uh.....I haven't really talked to him all that much.
[00:56:56] Cave Johnson: Her.
[00:56:58] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Ah
[00:57:01] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Excuse me
[00:57:01] Cave Johnson: Arianna.
[00:57:05] Cave Johnson: She's a "The Third."
[00:57:21] Cave Johnson: Born with a silver spoon up her mouth and ass, I swear.
[00:57:24] Cave Johnson: Not at all caroline.
[00:58:04] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: A good portion of admistrators don't understand that moral is important with the CCA and being a ultra up tight high up can disrupt that.
[00:58:10] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Not to say they are bad
[00:58:22] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: But they aren't great for moral between CCA units.
[00:58:29] Cave Johnson: Yeah.
[00:58:40] Cave Johnson: Business is good until they don't feel like an individual though.
[00:58:46] Cave Johnson: I put down the boot.
[00:58:52] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Yep
[00:58:59] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.22767: I feel like a good PR team would help rather than the same posters we've been putting up for weeks
[00:59:00] Cave Johnson: Back at aperture, you had to.
[00:59:30] Cave Johnson: Not a bad idea, I'll bring that up.
[00:59:39] Cave Johnson: Did I talk about caroline on the broadcasts yet?
[00:59:47] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Unsure
[00:59:55] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.22767: Not to my knowledge
[00:59:59] Cave Johnson: She was my assistant at Aperture.
[01:00:08] Cave Johnson: Ever since, hell, the seventies.
[01:00:17] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Damn.....
[01:00:22] Cave Johnson: Back when my handsomeness was in my youth and mustache.
[01:00:28] Cave Johnson: Now it's in my rugged aging.
[01:00:38] Cave Johnson: But, yeah.
[01:00:40] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: I understand
[01:00:41] Cave Johnson: Long time assistant.
[01:00:44] Cave Johnson: She was great.
[01:00:49] Cave Johnson: Nobody got science like her.
[01:00:59] Cave Johnson: Backbone of aperture, couldn't have done it without her.
[01:01:02] Cave Johnson: I feel like we...
[01:01:04] Cave Johnson: Hold shit.
[01:01:08] Cave Johnson: .//Holy shit.*
[01:01:09] Cave Johnson: Holy shit!
[01:01:12] Cave Johnson: I just remembered!
[01:01:23] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.22767: Everything alright?
[01:01:27] Cave Johnson: More than alright.
[01:01:31] Cave Johnson: Aperture could still be alive.
[01:01:39] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Possibly.
[01:01:45] Cave Johnson: No, you don't get it.
[01:02:12] Cave Johnson: while I was sick, we were working on the Genetic lifeform and Disk Operating System.
[01:02:19] Cave Johnson: So when I died, they could pour me into a computer.
[01:02:30] Cave Johnson: Well, before.
[01:02:32] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Oh....
[01:02:33] Cave Johnson: I died.
[01:02:35] Cave Johnson: Well.
[01:02:38] Cave Johnson: They thought I did.'
[01:03:05] Cave Johnson: But I told those eggheads.
[01:03:13] Cave Johnson: I told them, "put caroline in my computer if I die."
[01:03:23] Cave Johnson: If they finished it, aperture could still exist.
[01:03:46] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Hm.....then it does seem possible.
[01:03:48] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.22767: Well sir, with all due respect seeing as the union found you, and likely apature along with you, then chances are they already have the area on lock down
[01:04:10] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.22767: And from what you've said they are likely studying your reaserch
[01:04:32] Cave Johnson: I haven't told them where aperture is yet. They haven't asked. I've been too busy with this science.
[01:04:33] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Or other projects the Universal Union is coming up with
[01:04:47] Cave Johnson: We were based in michigan, far from my off campusl;

[01:05:16] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: By the way, off topic but have you ever thought of allowing up .9mm RIP rounds?
[01:05:18] Cave Johnson: I could meet caroline again!

[01:05:57] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: They are........absolutely terrifying.
[01:06:05] Cave Johnson: Cool. Sure.
[01:06:10] Cave Johnson: Could we organize a mission?
[01:06:13] Cave Johnson: I remember the main campus.
[01:06:25] Cave Johnson: Hold on, I need to tell the benefactors.
[01:06:39] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Then have a good day.

[20:02:40] Santino Russo: I'm Santino. Pleasure to meet you, aswell.
[20:03:05] Santino Russo: I was wondering... Is that Glados thing a big machine of some type?
[20:03:35] Alfred Langenberg: // computer shut down again doublepog
[20:03:43] Cave Johnson: Partially. It's a way of emulating a human being's intelligence and personality,
[20:03:45] Alfred Langenberg: // gotta close discord it lkes to fuck with my computer
[20:03:58] Cave Johnson: You can keep data on a compact disk, why can't you keep a man's personality on one?
[20:04:02] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: // F
[20:04:03] Santino Russo: That's right.
[20:04:25] Cave Johnson: Artificial intelligence. Brain mapping. Knock your socks off type stuff.
[20:04:30] Santino Russo: So could you then power it by potatoes? I feel that the future is in potato power.
[20:04:34] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: // Cave Johnson is getting babysitted by a fucking GRID i2 when he should have OTA smh
[20:04:39] Alfred Langenberg: .// jooj
[20:04:48] Santino Russo: Anything could be potato powered if you tried hard enough.
[20:04:51] Santino Russo: Or lemons.
[20:04:57] Cave Johnson: I mean, this is true. Potato power speaks to me more.
[20:05:01] Alfred Langenberg: // he's cave, he's invented a doomsday device to keep in his pocket, to keep away rebels.
[20:05:05] Cave Johnson: I think there was this scientist back in the day.
[20:05:24] Cave Johnson: He told his daughter about potato power and she loved it.
[20:05:50] Cave Johnson: She told her dad, "Daddy, can I show my potato power to Mister Johnson?"
[20:06:02] Cave Johnson: .//this is a callback
[20:06:06] Cave Johnson: Precious little kid.
[20:06:07] Cave Johnson: Never met her.
[20:06:40] Cave Johnson: I don't suppose it couldn't be. There's a lot of combine technology that is super effective, and potatoes would be considered primitive.
[20:06:50] Santino Russo: Unless you prove otherwise...
[20:06:57] Cave Johnson: With your cutting edge Dark Energy research, we've kind of progressed past the need.
[20:07:01] Cave Johnson: .//with our*
[20:07:07] Santino Russo: Yeah, I suppose so.

[20:07:56] Alfred Langenberg: .// santino
[20:07:59] Santino Russo: Though potatoes could be a backup or something.
[20:08:05] Santino Russo: .// i made it
[20:08:09] Alfred Langenberg: .// yes
[20:08:09] Cave Johnson: Absolutely, without a doubt.
[20:08:11] Santino Russo: // i made everything
[20:08:22] Alfred Langenberg: // and I made you, my sweet little child.
[20:08:29] Cave Johnson: When all things go to hell, we can always rely on potatoes.
[20:08:36] Santino Russo: Ol' reliable.
[20:08:40] Santino Russo: Say... How much destructive capability do you think lemons have?
[20:09:08] Cave Johnson: Well, eat too many and your tongue might get a bit raw.,
[20:09:09] Cave Johnson: .//raw.*
[20:09:19] Santino Russo: That is always devastating.
[20:09:21] Cave Johnson: Citric acid is the stuff on sour candy.
