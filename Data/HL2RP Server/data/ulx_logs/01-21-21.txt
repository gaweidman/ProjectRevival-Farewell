[18:31:39] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: I have an idea.
[18:32:41] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: You both walk out of here, there was never a mugging, your hostage lost his gear in the bunks.
[18:32:53] Derrek Thornberry: // Can I be let in
[18:33:03] Preobrazhensky ''Sarge'' Bogolepov: You have to drop your weapons, we can't walk out of here knowing you have it
