[15:34:58] Wallace Breen: /broadcast To say he came off pleasing is an understatement.
[15:35:30] Wallace Breen: /broadcast The Consul was a delight to meet. Speaking to him, you can see how much he loves the union.
[15:36:24] Wallace Breen: /broadcast When I received my title of Administrator of City 14, so coincidentally the same city plagued with Xenobe frustrations, the Consul offered my advice whenever I reached out for it.
[15:36:34] Wallace Breen: /broadcast This was a man who loved all of you.
[15:36:35] Wallace Breen: /doorsethidden true
[15:36:46] Wallace Breen: /broadcast Yet, he was a cunning leader nonetheless.
[15:37:02] Wallace Breen: /broadcast He could separate his sentimentality from his work, and that, is what made him such an amazing leader.
[15:37:53] Alfred Langenberg: // oh my god these beef jerky tastes awful
[15:37:55] Alfred Langenberg: // holy shit
[15:38:25] Wallace Breen: /broadcast He understood how anti-citizens thought, how to make appeals with them. He had a delicate balance of firmness and emotional softness.
[15:39:07] Wallace Breen: /broadcast I sometimes think to myself how thankful I was to not be in his City's administration. Working for such a hard worker is difficult. He knows what he wants, and he is not afraid pushing you to it.
[15:39:23] Wallace Breen: /broadcast It has been beyond an honor and a pleasure to work with the Consul.
[15:39:49] Wallace Breen: /broadcast I look back on my time with him with gratitude.
[15:39:54] Wallace Breen: /broadcast Thank you all for coming today.
[15:40:33] Wallace Breen: /broadcast To pay your respect, I have with me a gift he received from our benefactors. A platinum medal fashioned in the shape of the Union Claw's logo.

[22:36:53] Wallace Breen: Otherwise, they won't be able to get in.
[22:37:00] Wallace Breen: I have...
[22:37:12] Wallace Breen: /it You see Breen think for a moment, as if thinking of a lie.
