[21:50:55] Odell Cubbage: Good question.

[21:51:03] Odell Cubbage: The ship would not have gone anywhere.
[21:51:03] Anya Solovyov: They'd be jealous if we got out of here and they had to stay,
[21:51:08] Kodiak Sokov: I'd love to help searching but that's probably out of my ability.
[21:51:14] Jordan Miles: /w I bet they got loads of radios in there. Perhaps that's why he was reluctant on us trying to recover this one in particular?
[21:51:16] PVT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: First official day of being a conscript and this shit happens

[23:33:40] Kodiak Sokov: Well.
[23:34:04] Kodiak Sokov: Either we go back or do whatever. City's going quiet.
[23:34:31] Anya Solovyov: Fuckers coming out of their wierd house,
[23:34:53] Anya Solovyov: Can't even go back to our house cause there's rotting bug bodies in there..

[23:36:33] The Consul: /broadcast That counts as a level 3 violation for wasting a union official's time

[23:37:30] Kodiak Sokov: This feels like someone's base.
[23:37:34] Kodiak Sokov: I dunno.
[23:37:37] Anya Solovyov: I don't think the person who brought me here wanted me back,
[23:37:39] Anya Solovyov: But..
[23:37:46] The Consul: /broadcast What's so toxic about the air, anyway? Never fully understood.
[23:37:51] The Consul: /broadcast From KS.
[23:37:52] Anya Solovyov: The alternative is the loud cafe, or the antlion house.
[23:38:01] Kodiak Sokov: Ooh, there's my message.
[23:38:04] Anya Solovyov: Hm.
[23:38:04] Kodiak Sokov: And fair enough.
[23:38:14] Anya Solovyov: At least its warm by the machines.
[23:38:21] The Consul: /broadcast Well, KS, that is a wonderful question.
[23:38:38] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: what the fuck?
[23:38:39] The Consul: /broadcast The wonder of the Union's work is something with consequences, good and bad.
[23:39:00] Kodiak Sokov: Of course..
[23:39:03] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: demon baby?
[23:39:07] The Consul: /broadcast The most notable one is the progression of both technology and society.
[23:39:10] PVT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: Just noticed?
[23:39:14] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: yes
[23:39:14] PVT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: Noted
[23:39:24] Anya Solovyov: /me rolls her eyes and slides down the wall, sitting against it. "Of course they fucked up the air."
[23:39:44] The Consul: /broadcast We have the chance to improve our living situation, and spread our glory to others.
[23:39:48] Kodiak Sokov: /me slowly shakes his head and facepalms.
[23:39:53] The Consul: /broadcast Perhaps even those who have not been enlightened on our duty.
[23:40:12] Anya Solovyov: Dumb as fuck.
[23:40:16] Kodiak Sokov: The QNA just turned into propaganda it seems.
[23:40:18] The Consul: /broadcast However, this, as all other things in the world, has its bad consequences.
[23:40:34] Anya Solovyov: It's not propaganda if nobody fucking likes them.
[23:40:46] The Consul: /broadcast One of these is the excretion of undesirable materials into the environment.
[23:40:51] PVT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: Were you sleeping through that entire thing?
[23:40:56] Kodiak Sokov: There's probably loyalists around, lurking about so they aren't beaten by regular civvies.
[23:41:08] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: W- G- No, of course not
[23:41:17] Anya Solovyov: I'd ruin their damn day.
[23:41:26] PVT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: A massive portal showed up in the Plaza and flying demon babies attacked us.
[23:41:28] Kodiak Sokov: Me too.
[23:41:29] The Consul: /broadcast Because of our unstoppable resolve and our will to work, these materials are excreted far more often than any typical society.
[23:41:32] PVT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: Also we have a massive Exogen breach.
[23:41:34] PVT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: It was great.
[23:41:39] Anya Solovyov: Month, if I could get at em' long enough.
[23:41:53] The Consul: /broadcast In a way, this is symbolic.
[23:41:53] The Consul: /doorsethidden true
[23:41:58] Kodiak Sokov: I'd rather fuck them over in a more secretive method.
[23:42:02] PVT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: When I say great I mean my worst nightmare
[23:42:05] Anya Solovyov: Jaws are, unsuprisingly, not easy to repair.
[23:42:06] PVT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: by the way
[23:42:12] Anya Solovyov: ..As far as I know.
[23:42:18] PVT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: One of our men got demoted to negative magget 
[23:42:19] The Consul: /broadcast The gas is toxic because it is the residue left by a poor society being washed away.
[23:42:25] Kodiak Sokov: Yeah. I think that's true.
[23:42:26] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: how?
[23:42:29] PVT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: Which is two ranks belo-
[23:42:35] PVT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: Disregarding orders numerous times.
[23:42:45] PVT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: And plain being the worst soldier we have.
[23:42:48] PVT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: Just overall bad
[23:42:51] The Consul: /broadcast The more scientific answer, though, because of the chemistry of the things we make.
[23:42:52] Client "Johnny Violence" spawned in server <STEAM_0:1:151885836> (took 887 seconds).
[23:42:53] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: why hasn
[23:43:00] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: 't he just been amputated?
[23:43:01] PVT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: Suprised he was allowed into the Conscripts.
[23:43:05] Kodiak Sokov: /me scratches at his left arm, ineffective due to the suit. "Fucking hell..."
[23:43:18] PVT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: The Conscripts allow even dumb and bad people to join and stay.
[23:43:22] PVT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: We just use them as cover.
[23:43:27] PVT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: Human cover.
[23:43:42] Kodiak Sokov: You think the Union's got some magical shit to treat side effects of intense scarring like itching and shit?
[23:43:45] PVT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: That way we can be effecient with our terrible and low preforming soldiers.
[23:43:57] Anya Solovyov: They can probably treat anything.
[23:43:59] PVT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: Killing every bad soldier is wasted potential.
[23:44:03] Anya Solovyov: The questiion is will they,
[23:44:07] Anya Solovyov: And the answer is hell no.
[23:44:09] Anya Solovyov: Sorry.
[23:44:11] Kodiak Sokov: Heh.
[23:44:13] Kodiak Sokov: Fairl
[23:44:26] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: efficient
[23:44:28] The Consul: /broadcast Some of them involve the creation of undesirable materials at times.
[23:44:28] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: I like it
[23:44:32] PVT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: Exactly
[23:44:33] The Consul: /broadcast However, this is only temporary.
[23:44:41] Anya Solovyov: I didn't sign my questions, so if that man says my name I'm going to commit an unsavory act.
[23:44:41] The Consul: /broadcast For now, we must conserve oxygen wherever we can.
[23:44:45] PVT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: By the way, how is training in your department?
[23:44:48] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: oh yeah, code:SWORD is probably in effect
[23:44:52] Anya Solovyov: ..Of intense violence.
[23:44:56] The Consul: /broadcast In the future, we will have cleaner production and a way to remove these toxins.
[23:44:57] The Consul: /doorsethidden true
[23:44:59] Johnny Violence<STEAM_0:1:151885836> changed their name to Theo Poole
[23:45:06] Kodiak Sokov: Probably ain't a smart idea.
[23:45:12] The Consul: /broadcast I hope that answers your question, KS.
[23:45:19] Kodiak Sokov: It sure fucking does.
[23:45:29] Anya Solovyov: They're fuckin stalking us anyways..
[23:45:35] The Consul: /broadcast This one is an incredibly detailed drawing of..

[23:47:55] The Consul: /broadcast This letter reads, "Good afternoon Consul, I hope you're doing well.
[23:47:58] Theo Poole: Right here-
[23:47:58] PFC Lucas 'Cheems' Arnal: // Dear Consul, fuck you and leave me to my lotions
[23:48:03] Anya Solovyov: I asked the same as you,
[23:48:09] The Consul: /broadcast I'm writing this letter wondering when the air will be cleaned.
[23:48:12] Theo Poole: /me reaches for one of his pockets, swiping out a dusty relocation coupon.
[23:48:13] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: // oh, it appears the floor is caving in- OHG
[23:48:16] Anya Solovyov: And why it has been permitted for some dumbfuck to horde corpses.
[23:48:16] The Consul: /broadcast I don't like choking every time my filter runs out.
[23:48:26] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: give me it
[23:48:29] Kodiak Sokov: Fair enough.

[23:49:09] Kodiak Sokov: Probably gonna say 'I do apologize for this act of... antlion hoarding. We will get right on it!' and do nothing.
[23:49:19] The Consul: /broadcast I believe this ties in with our previous question.
[23:49:27] Anya Solovyov: Amazing.

[23:51:25] Theo Poole: /me reaches for the newly produced card, taking a swift look at its credentials.
[23:51:33] Kodiak Sokov: I get we are supposed to work, but really.
[23:51:37] Kodiak Sokov: That cuts our wage.
[23:51:39] Anya Solovyov: There are jobs?
[23:51:47] Kodiak Sokov: I'd assume so, if there's an economy.
[23:51:55] Kodiak Sokov: I don't think you get paid by complimenting people.
[23:52:04] Anya Solovyov: I wouldn't do it even if I did.
[23:52:11] The Consul: /broadcast I, personally, struggle with this as well, I assure you.

[23:52:35] Kodiak Sokov: Personal struggles, how cute.
[23:52:38] Kodiak Sokov: We all deal with it.
