[00:29:56] Anya Solovyov: Nearly shot me too, the fucking idiots..
[00:30:01] Kodiak Sokov: From what I saw, they were just interrogating, then vanished.
[00:30:05] Anya Solovyov: We don't know, for all we know they killed them both.

[00:30:45] Odell Cubbage: There was some alien on the screen.
[00:30:50] Odell Cubbage: Looked like a vortigaunt.
[00:30:58] Anya Solovyov: That was wierd.
[00:31:03] Kodiak Sokov: It was,
[00:31:06] Odell Cubbage: There was a lot of weird stuff going on.
[00:31:18] Kodiak Sokov: What is normal here anyway.
[00:31:28] Anya Solovyov: Hopefully not that shit..

[00:45:30] Odell Cubbage: I'm joking.
[00:45:34] Odell Cubbage: I don't smoke that poison.
[00:45:39] Odell Cubbage: Probably just cyanide in a stick.
[00:45:46] Anya Solovyov: Wouldn't matter much.
[00:45:52] Anya Solovyov: Probably less cancerous than the real air.

[00:46:05] Odell Cubbage: Put em in the gas mask and feel better.
[00:46:22] Anya Solovyov: Doesn't there also have to be fire involved?
[00:46:35] Odell Cubbage: Nah, they're pretty cool, actually.
[00:46:36] Anya Solovyov: Fire.. should not go in the gas mask.
[00:46:39] Odell Cubbage: They're matches..
[00:46:41] Odell Cubbage: Oh you mean in the gas mask.
[00:46:53] Anya Solovyov: You light the cigarette,

[00:47:24] Odell Cubbage: Yeah, is it true that that big alien was shooting out fire, or was that exaggeration?

[00:51:15] Anya Solovyov: Hordes??
[00:51:20] Kodiak Sokov: Well.
[00:51:25] Odell Cubbage: Annoying as shit? Yeah, those things will fuck your day up.
[00:51:26] Kodiak Sokov: I'd assume they'd operate in hordes.
[00:51:35] Odell Cubbage: I knew a buddy who got swarmed by them.
[00:51:37] Anya Solovyov: That thing was fucking terrifying alone.
[00:51:38] Odell Cubbage: Walked into this egg thing.

[00:54:04] Odell Cubbage: Oh, those bots?
[00:54:08] Odell Cubbage: You know those things spit fire?
[00:54:14] Kodiak Sokov: You're kidding.

[00:54:40] Odell Cubbage: I'm telling you.
[00:54:58] Kodiak Sokov: To answer that previous question though, I'm from Siberia.
