[21:34:01] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.50123: /r What the hell do you expect me to do?
[21:34:08] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: /r No clue. 
[21:34:12] Mason Patell: Alright, look. I've barricaded a bit of the door.
[21:34:22] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.50123: /r Where's the hostage and the dude?
[21:34:23] Mason Patell: The window here is *Clearly* bulletproof or you would've already shot me.
[21:34:29] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.50123: /toggleraise
[21:34:30] Mason Patell: How's about this fair trade.
[21:34:30] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.50123: /toggleraise
[21:34:33] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: /r Detainment Cell 4.
[21:34:37] Mason Patell: I open the door with Kodak infront of it.
[21:34:40] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.50123: /r I can shut down their air.
[21:34:43] Mason Patell: You open the door, and take him.
[21:34:45] Mason Patell: Okay?
[21:34:46] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: /r That'll work.
[21:34:48] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.50123: /r Do a fakeout.
[21:34:56] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.50123: /r Because that'll kill both of them.
[21:34:56] Mason Patell: How's that sound?
[21:35:11] Mason Patell: Why are there more doors, tell me how that sounds.
[21:35:22] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.50123: /r Act like we're taking them elsewhere, put him on the train tracks, and open them up.
[21:35:44] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: /rw Does the pod to the Plaza reroute anywhere?
[21:35:59] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: I have to make arrangments for your safe passage to the Plaza
[21:36:03] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.50123: /r It reroutes to the main pod system. Otherwise, no.
[21:36:11] Mason Patell: Stay, *here* Listen.
[21:36:22] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: /rw Anywhere that can contain the hostage taker?
[21:36:23] Mason Patell: I'm *trying* to get Kodiak out of here.. right here, right now.
[21:36:38] Mason Patell: I'll move him infront of the door, I'll be in the corner.
[21:36:39] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.50123: /r If you want him to get somewhere lethal then you gotta move him from one pod to another.
[21:36:42] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: well if I open the door, I'm going to have to get another officer in here
[21:36:42] Mason Patell: Just get him alright.
[21:36:49] Mason Patell: No, just do it yourself.
[21:36:49] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.50123: /r The hostage taker? Incinerator works. Train tracks work.
[21:36:57] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.50123: /r Do you get my plan?
[21:37:11] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: /rw Can you intercept them at the pod system?
[21:37:16] Client "XYZ509" spawned in server <STEAM_0:1:116497963> (took 406 seconds).

[21:37:37] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: /rw Amputate?
[21:37:38] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.50123: /r I could open the protective layer of the pod and then shoot him while he's in it.
[21:37:43] Mason Patell: *Speak* to me.
[21:37:45] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: /rw That'll work.
[21:37:48] Mason Patell: What are they saying. 
[21:37:55] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.50123: /r Good luck separating him from his hostage.
[21:38:00] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.50123: /r I like the train track plan, personally.
[21:38:05] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: Beauracratic bullshit
[21:38:09] Mason Patell: *Such as?*
[21:38:14] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: paperwork
[21:38:15] Mason Patell: Kodiak..
[21:38:21] Mason Patell: Are you still with me, friend?
[21:38:34] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: /rw I may be able to get him in the pod that goes to the Plaza.
[21:38:38] Kodiak Sokov: /me is unresponsive, but slowly moves his arm as a sign of living.
[21:38:39] Mason Patell: Listen, I'm *Sorry* I'm, I'm real *sorry* man.
[21:38:51] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.50123: /r Good. I can redirect him to the main pod hub and shoot him there.
[21:38:56] Mason Patell: /me *he'd lightly take Kodiak over to the wall infront of the door, propping him up*
[21:38:56] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: alright
[21:38:59] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: I got clearance

[21:39:34] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.50123: /r I still like the train idea.
[21:39:42] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.50123: /r Perfectly cruel for a dick like him.
[21:39:45] Mason Patell: He can't move.
[21:39:48] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: My hands are away from my holster
[21:39:49] Mason Patell: You need to get him.
[21:40:00] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: It's a one person pod
[21:40:05] Kodiak Sokov: /me slowly looks at the CP.
[21:40:16] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: Medics are already on their way, they can treat him in there then send him up
[21:40:20] Mason Patell: /me *he'd keep his hand shakily on the gun, ready to pull at any moment with his adrenaline*
[21:40:20] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: too risky to move him
[21:40:26] Mason Patell: Okay, okay so I'm going right?
[21:40:27] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: you ready?
[21:40:30] Mason Patell: Yes.

[23:19:37] Scott Jameson: /me *He'd check*
[23:19:42] Scott Jameson: In the Manuscript.
[23:19:42] Kodiak Sokov: /me looks through the boxes, taking out the assembly body first and setting it aside, then the wood panels, setting those aside too.
[23:19:52] Scott Jameson: So we're fine, its just a Connect-Together Puzzle..
[23:20:04] Scott Jameson: Alright lets see here..
[23:20:05] Kodiak Sokov: Nothing I can't handle.
[23:20:11] Scott Jameson: First, Mr. Sokov.
[23:20:33] Scott Jameson: Set the Wooden Panels in Place on the Assembly Body, use the Screwdriver and the Hammer to make sure the parts are in Sturdy and Tight.
[23:20:43] Kodiak Sokov: Mkay....
[23:21:23] Scott Jameson: /me *while the other Citizen performed his action, the Fabrication-Savvy Man would follow the laid out Electrical Instructions.*
[23:21:26] Kodiak Sokov: /me positions the assembly body in place. He then takes the wooden panels, and one by one sets them inside the body, taking tools now and then to ensure they are indeed sturdy and tight.
[23:21:39] CCA.C17-UNION.i1.51023: //i'm a good delegative owner
[23:22:05] Kodiak Sokov: /me seemed to be doing this task without any sort of issue and going at a decent pace, as if he put together plenty of things before.
[23:22:06] Scott Jameson: /me *he'd flip over the covered screen onto the floor, beginning to connect the Power Supply to it alongside various rigged-cables that will connect to lower Sectors of the Shell-Assembly Body.
[23:22:32] Scott Jameson: /me *Once this process was completed, he'd take the Screen now with the Power Supply and Cables attached over to the Skeleton.
[23:22:35] Kodiak Sokov: I must say... this is quite enjoyable, being able to be hands-on now with things.
[23:22:36] CCA.C17-UNION.i1.51023: I'm exchanging places, an OTA will be here with you soon.
[23:22:46] Scott Jameson: Excuse me Mr. Kodiak..
