[00:50:20] Odell Cubbage: We've decrypted small parts of it. To put it simply, the encoding process is a very interesting thing, speaking technically.
[00:50:34] Odell Cubbage: These transmissions go out daily, if not more frequently.
[00:50:55] Odell Cubbage: Each of them have a form of encoding in which the message itself is, in some part, the key with which it's encodded.

[00:51:01] Odell Cubbage: An incestuous mess.

[00:58:56] Anya Solovyov: // i lost my headset but im back
[00:58:56] Client "adamrossm2016" connected.
[00:58:58] Client "adamrossm2016" connected.
[00:59:15] Anya Solovyov: // I found my headset and im back
[01:01:28] Anya Solovyov: // Hello:?
[01:01:30] Odell Cubbage: //yo
[01:01:31] Odell Cubbage: //sorryi m' here
[01:01:35] Anya Solovyov: // yay!
[01:01:58] Odell Cubbage: //alright
[01:02:00] Odell Cubbage: Cmere
[01:02:02] Odell Cubbage: check this out
[01:02:15] Odell Cubbage: Look at this screen here, with the blue
[01:02:31] Odell Cubbage: /it You see a lot of white computer nonsense, just garbage characters.
[01:02:43] Odell Cubbage: That's normal, just watch.
[01:03:01] Odell Cubbage: /me would press the arrow key until coming to coherent english
[01:03:13] Odell Cubbage: So it's a little garbled, but the meaning is absolutely there.
[01:03:37] Odell Cubbage: /it "Disturbances throughout time." It's clear as day.
[01:03:48] Odell Cubbage: Then right below that, right?
[01:04:15] Odell Cubbage: /it "Planes of space colliding."
[01:04:26] Odell Cubbage: This was sent the same day as the so-called fireworks incident.
[01:04:36] Odell Cubbage: 2 hours after..
[01:05:02] Odell Cubbage: Further back? We keep getting two initials consistently.
[01:05:08] Odell Cubbage: AEX, and WCT.
[01:05:33] Odell Cubbage: We have no idea what they mean, but they show up consistently.
[01:05:51] Odell Cubbage: We've got something else here. This is where it's strange.
[01:05:54] Odell Cubbage: It's a train, right?
[01:06:01] Odell Cubbage: It's coordinates for a train ride.
[01:06:05] Odell Cubbage: Start and end times.
[01:06:22] Odell Cubbage: Seems innocent, but why is that under such strong encryption?
[01:06:36] Odell Cubbage: Makes zero sense, right?
[01:06:47] Odell Cubbage: Unless there's something important on those trains.
[01:07:04] Odell Cubbage: Today, 30 minutes before the work cycle. "Project Blade."
[01:07:27] Odell Cubbage: Last legible fragment says the word briefcase.
[01:07:38] Odell Cubbage: Something is up. They're not just using our planet to make money.
[01:07:43] Odell Cubbage: Anya, they want something.
[01:08:03] Odell Cubbage: /me would be speeding up his speech, having a mixture both deep terror and fiery passion.
[01:08:22] Odell Cubbage: The Combine isn't some fascist dictatorship, it's.. it's far different.
[01:08:36] Odell Cubbage: /me exhales, then flicks his wrist.
[01:08:53] Odell Cubbage: That's.. all I have.
[01:08:56] Odell Cubbage: On that.
[01:09:34] Odell Cubbage: Speechless?
[01:10:18] Anya Solovyov: ..If they have something, we should fuck up one of those trains and see what it is.
[01:10:33] Odell Cubbage: I'd love to.
[01:10:38] Odell Cubbage: Trust me, I would absolutely love to
[01:10:41] Odell Cubbage: That was 3 days ago, I'm sure it's landed.
[01:10:51] Odell Cubbage: Even then, if it's something that important, we would be dead men.
[01:11:03] Odell Cubbage: Erm, *and women.*
[01:11:29] Anya Solovyov: We're all basically dead men anyways..
[01:11:37] Odell Cubbage: Particularly dead.
[01:11:46] Odell Cubbage: We'd be the Superman of dying.
[01:11:56] Anya Solovyov: Right..
[01:12:07] Odell Cubbage: Trust me, I would love to crack open one of those trains.
[01:12:13] Odell Cubbage: Something on those is not good.
[01:12:22] Odell Cubbage: It's unfriendly.
[01:12:49] Odell Cubbage: AEX and WCT, as well.
[01:12:56] Odell Cubbage: Sounds like airport names.
[01:13:25] Odell Cubbage: .//IC i have explanations for all of those too
[01:13:33] Anya Solovyov: It does.. Maybe they're places, then. Somewhere far away from here.
[01:13:40] Anya Solovyov: .// I expected as much 
[01:13:47] Odell Cubbage: .//i like telling stries.
[01:13:56] Anya Solovyov: .// You do it well.
[01:14:08] Odell Cubbage: .//Thank you! :D
[01:14:11] Odell Cubbage: .//that means alot
[01:14:28] Odell Cubbage: Places, good thought.
[01:14:28] Anya Solovyov: .// Yeah, of course :)
[01:14:54] Odell Cubbage: From what we know, Nova Prospekt OTA have the area code NPK.
[01:15:15] Odell Cubbage: So they would be OTA.NPK-ECHO.OWS.55555
[01:15:20] Odell Cubbage: Could be like that
[01:15:40] Anya Solovyov: Right.. They're just different zones, then?
[01:15:51] Odell Cubbage: Specific zones.
[01:15:57] Odell Cubbage: Nova prospekt is in the 17th sector.
[01:16:21] Odell Cubbage: And there's a separate code for the 17th sector.
[01:16:23] Odell Cubbage: .//whoops void
[01:16:35] Odell Cubbage: So likely some special location.
[01:16:45] Odell Cubbage: Something worse than nova prospekt
[01:16:59] Odell Cubbage: or at least more secretive.
[01:17:28] Anya Solovyov: More importiant to them..
[01:17:39] Odell Cubbage: That too, that too.
[01:17:47] Odell Cubbage: Far more important.
[01:17:51] Odell Cubbage: Nova Prospekt is amazing.
[01:17:57] Odell Cubbage: In a horrible way.
[01:18:04] Odell Cubbage: We know it exist.
[01:18:06] Odell Cubbage: .//exists.*
[01:18:16] Odell Cubbage: We have data on its... not exact location, but, pretty close.
[01:18:19] Odell Cubbage: Very close location.
[01:18:28] Odell Cubbage: Yet we have zero clue what's inside.
[01:18:40] Odell Cubbage: Not one idea.
[01:19:11] Odell Cubbage: Yet it's public knowledge
[01:19:19] Anya Solovyov: Where is it, then?
[01:19:30] Odell Cubbage: Not far from City 17, actually.
[01:19:59] Odell Cubbage: 65 miles off or so
[01:20:03] Odell Cubbage: .//wait i'm french
[01:20:04] Odell Cubbage: .//hoel on
[01:20:09] Anya Solovyov: .// counting
[01:20:16] Odell Cubbage: 100 kilometers or so.
[01:20:45] Anya Solovyov: Good enough ways away that they could catch anybody trying to get to it.
[01:20:50] Odell Cubbage: /me takes his keyboard and goes to the command line, putting in the command:
[01:21:26] Odell Cubbage: it java pleasework3-worksnow-working.class 100
[01:21:29] Odell Cubbage: /me looks at the screen.
[01:21:32] Odell Cubbage: 60 or so miles.
[01:21:37] Odell Cubbage: Yeah.
[01:21:44] Odell Cubbage: And people go to it.. frequently.
[01:21:58] Anya Solovyov: And live?
[01:22:03] Odell Cubbage: /me shrugs.
[01:22:07] Odell Cubbage: /me would flick his wrist.
[01:22:24] Odell Cubbage: Never heard of anybody coming back.
[01:22:27] Odell Cubbage: Could be a work camp.
[01:22:33] Odell Cubbage: Maybe they get some resource from there.
[01:22:36] Odell Cubbage: That needs more research.
[01:22:45] Anya Solovyov: Maybe they bring some resource there..
[01:22:56] Odell Cubbage: To make something? Like a factory?
[01:23:00] Anya Solovyov: Right..
[01:23:05] Odell Cubbage: hm
[01:23:09] Anya Solovyov: Make something, research something..
[01:23:12] Odell Cubbage: Humans would be workers, then.
[01:23:29] Anya Solovyov: More than likely, but that seems to be standard everywhere.
[01:23:33] Odell Cubbage: true, true
[01:23:50] Odell Cubbage: Wonder what.
[01:24:04] Odell Cubbage: I don't think they'd have regular citizens researching things, unless they need test subjects.
[01:24:12] Odell Cubbage: Although even that's a stretch.
[01:24:19] Anya Solovyov: If it's something so secret though, I would be suprised if they let humans anywhere near it at all..
[01:24:34] Odell Cubbage: Dead men don't tell secrets.
[01:24:54] Odell Cubbage: Make sure the people who come close to getting out have no way of it, you've got a solid secret.
[01:25:09] Odell Cubbage: The team I work with personally hasn't sent anyone there.
[01:25:30] Odell Cubbage: But I would imagine something that secret has very good control of who gets in or out.
[01:25:34] Odell Cubbage: 'Course, it's only a matter of time.
[01:25:37] Anya Solovyov: That's likely for the best, you might never hear from them again.
[01:25:48] Odell Cubbage: Yeah, exactly.
[01:26:06] Odell Cubbage: It's a suicide mission, we've got an unspoken agreement.
[01:26:17] Odell Cubbage: Watch it be some dude holding in a shotgun guns blazing that makes it in
[01:26:19] Odell Cubbage: /me chuckles.
[01:26:37] Odell Cubbage: Still, though.
[01:26:39] Odell Cubbage: Not a laughing matter.
[01:26:46] Odell Cubbage: What were you going to say?
[01:27:02] Odell Cubbage: /event foreshadowing su bt lethy
[01:27:10] Anya Solovyov: Probably wouldn't matter much if they did shoot up the place, unless they managed to create some way out.
[01:27:12] Odell Cubbage: /event gorbomn freemantot
[01:27:21] Odell Cubbage: true, true
[01:27:31] Anya Solovyov: // just a sec, cats pissed about smth
[01:27:34] Odell Cubbage: //alright
[01:28:12] Odell Cubbage<STEAM_0:1:53097688> spawned model models/props/industrial17/arcademachine4.mdl

[01:28:44] Odell Cubbage<STEAM_0:1:53097688> used the tool textscreen on models/props/industrial17/arcademachine4.mdl
[01:29:02] Odell Cubbage: Either way, it's amazing how it's that much of a mystery despite bieng public knowledge.
[01:29:13] Odell Cubbage: So the AEX, or the WCT must be very important.
[01:29:17] Odell Cubbage: Some kind of headquarters?
[01:29:22] Odell Cubbage: X is a really secretive letter.
[01:29:52] Anya Solovyov: Headquarters maybe.. They could store something, though. Something, someone..
[01:30:07] Anya Solovyov: Something that they want to hold onto.
[01:30:22] Odell Cubbage: X shows authority, headquarters matched,
[01:30:28] Odell Cubbage: Or maybe it's mundane.
[01:30:32] Anya Solovyov: Ah, that makes sense.
[01:30:32] Odell Cubbage: Alert Emergency... X?
[01:30:35] Odell Cubbage: Like a bunker.
[01:30:54] Odell Cubbage: Somewhere to go if the city ever goes to hell, worst case scenario.
[01:31:03] Odell Cubbage: I'm just guessing, though.
[01:31:22] Anya Solovyov: It makes sense.
[01:31:40] Odell Cubbage: Not the best acronym, but it's what I've got.
[01:31:48] Odell Cubbage: Do you have any questions for me? I've been going on for a while.
[01:32:04] Anya Solovyov: How did you find any of this in the first place?
[01:32:23] Odell Cubbage: Well, I was told by someone. Someone who told someone else, who, you get the picture.
[01:32:32] Odell Cubbage: We know that it was built post-combine.
[01:33:28] Odell Cubbage: Records that we found here seem to say that it was built by some... I think americans call them preppers?
[01:33:31] Odell Cubbage: /chargiveflag anya R
[01:33:46] Odell Cubbage: .//russian flag
[01:33:50] Anya Solovyov: .// thanks :D
[01:33:53] Odell Cubbage: .//yep!
[01:33:59] Anya Solovyov: Like.. doomsday?
[01:34:08] Odell Cubbage: Yeah, people who were very cautious about the world ending.
[01:34:19] Odell Cubbage: Wait, did I say post?
[01:34:21] Odell Cubbage: Sorry, pre, I mean.
[01:34:23] Odell Cubbage: English. Ugh.
[01:34:44] Odell Cubbage: They were looking for places to hide, though. They found this series of utility rooms, and when the aliens came, they put up a false vending machine.
[01:35:15] Odell Cubbage: Combine came and it was replaced with a Consulate water faceplate.
[01:35:43] Anya Solovyov: That's this whole place?
[01:35:43] Odell Cubbage: Then they spread the word, the word kept getting spread.
[01:35:51] Odell Cubbage: That's what the records show.
[01:36:18] Odell Cubbage: It was a series of utilities and maintenance things for the generators in the big room.
[01:36:23] Odell Cubbage: The big vert things.
[01:36:26] Odell Cubbage: Green, sorry.
[01:36:51] Odell Cubbage: The movie theater thing is where it gets weird.
[01:37:09] Odell Cubbage: When everybody was looting and all that, they put in a secret door in the nearby theater.
[01:37:17] Odell Cubbage: So that didn't used to be here.
[01:37:32] Odell Cubbage: Then the Combine turned it into a place for propaganda, and now it's a really ironic place.
[01:37:49] Odell Cubbage: Ironic door, rather.
[01:37:53] Anya Solovyov: Could be problematic if your timing is wrong.
[01:37:58] Odell Cubbage: yep
[01:38:00] Odell Cubbage: We try not to use it
[01:38:10] Odell Cubbage: Good thing is it's only one way.
[01:38:16] Odell Cubbage: They won't find it unless they look for it
[01:38:45] Anya Solovyov: They probably won't find it regardless, until they find someone leaving it.
[01:38:50] Odell Cubbage: exactly
[01:38:58] Odell Cubbage: exactly why we don't touch it
[01:39:03] Odell Cubbage: Any other questions?
[01:39:31] Anya Solovyov: Not really.. This is all very strange though..
[01:39:40] Odell Cubbage: Surreal? Hard to take in?
[01:39:44] Odell Cubbage: Or believe?
[01:39:54] Anya Solovyov: I believe you, it's just..
[01:40:07] Anya Solovyov: A lot, of not good things.
[01:40:08] Odell Cubbage: No, I mean hard to believe rather.
[01:40:15] Odell Cubbage: Go ahead, I'm listening.
[01:40:28] Anya Solovyov: ..Go ahead with what.
[01:40:53] Odell Cubbage: Talk about it if you want.
[01:40:56] Odell Cubbage: You said a lot of not good things.
[01:41:03] Odell Cubbage: You mean just the stuff you learned?
[01:41:11] Anya Solovyov: That's what all of this is, yeah.
[01:41:39] Odell Cubbage: yeah
[01:41:42] Odell Cubbage: .//whops
[01:41:44] Odell Cubbage: Yeah.
[01:41:46] Odell Cubbage: It's a lot.

[01:45:04] Odell Cubbage: .//*thumbs up while bleeding profusely*
[01:45:09] Anya Solovyov: .// right,
[01:45:19] Odell Cubbage: So this here is the common room.
[01:45:23] Odell Cubbage: Got an arcade cabinet, a TV.
[01:45:35] Odell Cubbage: This is the main room.
[01:45:39] Odell Cubbage: We've got scientific instruments here.
[01:45:48] Odell Cubbage: We monitor a lot of things the Combine does.
[01:46:06] Anya Solovyov: And they don't catch you doing it?
[01:46:17] Odell Cubbage: you may remember when we first came here during the non-fireworks incident
[01:46:22] Odell Cubbage: No, we don't go into their systems.
[01:46:28] Odell Cubbage: We just track natural things that they do as well.
[01:46:53] Odell Cubbage: Weather patterns, spacial activity, irregular electromagnetic radiation
[01:47:28] Odell Cubbage: This here is all super significant, yet it could still be improved
[01:47:33] Odell Cubbage: I'm not a scientist, just an engineer.
[01:47:39] Odell Cubbage: Purdue university.
[01:47:53] Odell Cubbage: This is pretty self explanatory.
[01:47:57] Odell Cubbage: More common spac.e
[01:48:08] Odell Cubbage: /pm echo SWIM
[01:48:16] Odell Cubbage: This here is going to be our bunks and triage center.
[01:48:28] Odell Cubbage: Gonna put up a little half wall or something.
[01:48:28] Odell Cubbage: /doorsethidden false
[01:48:40] Odell Cubbage: Like I said, we used to have a lot more furniture.
[01:48:46] Odell Cubbage: We're doing, how you say, renovations?
[01:48:52] Odell Cubbage: No, no, refurnishing.
[01:49:05] Anya Solovyov: Changing all the rooms, right.
[01:49:10] Odell Cubbage: oui
[01:49:14] Odell Cubbage: Then this you know
[01:49:15] Odell Cubbage: The way out
[01:49:22] Odell Cubbage: we keep this door closed.
[01:49:23] Anya Solovyov: Unfortunately.
[01:49:33] Odell Cubbage: out here...
[01:49:47] Odell Cubbage: We've got these generators.
[01:49:50] Odell Cubbage: We get our power from them.
[01:49:59] Anya Solovyov: How does that go unnoticed?
[01:50:20] Odell Cubbage: Combine doesn't mess with Earth power. They wired all the city up to their power.
[01:50:24] Odell Cubbage: I think it's some form of nuclear.
[01:50:37] Anya Solovyov: I see..
[01:50:42] Odell Cubbage: This here is hydroelectric.
[01:50:55] Odell Cubbage: There's a lake a couple miles down.
[01:51:04] Odell Cubbage: Leads into the nearby beach.
[01:51:07] Anya Solovyov: I've seen the water, it was an unpleaseant experience.
[01:51:21] Odell Cubbage: Yeah, antlions?
[01:51:28] Anya Solovyov: Antlions..
[01:51:37] Odell Cubbage: Or leggies.
[01:51:39] Anya Solovyov: And being threatened for standing near a boat.
[01:51:40] Odell Cubbage: Leggies is cuter.
[01:51:42] Odell Cubbage: Oh.
[01:51:47] Odell Cubbage: Yeah, the soldiers.
[01:52:06] Odell Cubbage: Honestly, you should be more scared of the antlions.
[01:52:12] Odell Cubbage: You know the Combine is scared of them?
[01:52:21] Anya Solovyov: They should be. Those things are fucking huge.
[01:52:26] Odell Cubbage: and strong, too.
[01:52:28] Anya Solovyov: And spit some kind of blue shit.
[01:52:33] Odell Cubbage: Oh, the spitters, yeah.
[01:52:34] Anya Solovyov: ..That shit hurt.
[01:52:39] Odell Cubbage: Corrosive, yeah.
[01:52:49] Odell Cubbage: Think sour candy but literally harmful.
[01:52:58] Odell Cubbage: Don't recommend tasting it.
[01:53:03] Odell Cubbage: The reason they don't go down easy is because of their strength.
[01:53:17] Odell Cubbage: According to the vortigaunts, they're not from where the rest of the aliens are.
[01:53:19] Odell Cubbage: They're tough bastards.
[01:53:31] Odell Cubbage: They tank gunfire like it's pebbles, they've only got a few important spots.
[01:53:34] Odell Cubbage: Legs and thorax.
[01:54:05] Anya Solovyov: Yeah.. one of the soldiers died in the street or something to them.
[01:54:17] Anya Solovyov: Only time I've heard one killed so close.
[01:54:23] Odell Cubbage: Yeah.
[01:54:32] Odell Cubbage: You don't mess with leggies.
[01:54:43] Anya Solovyov: I'll be happy to never see one again.
[01:54:52] Odell Cubbage: Be careful, they like the beach.
[01:54:54] Odell Cubbage: Let's go back in.
[01:54:57] Odell Cubbage: safety.
[01:55:12] Odell Cubbage: But, yeah.
[01:55:19] Odell Cubbage: They're unfriendly bastards.
[01:55:35] Odell Cubbage: .//do you want a recap of our past HL2 campaigns
[01:55:44] Anya Solovyov: .// sure, sounds cool
[01:55:48] Odell Cubbage: .//gamer so
[01:55:56] Odell Cubbage: .//our first one was the air exchange
[01:56:11] Odell Cubbage: .//we, with a team of other rebels, in a brazen act of ego, destroyed the air exchange
[01:56:22] Odell Cubbage: .//there was going to be more buildup
[01:56:50] Odell Cubbage: .//but we called it short after people wanted a map change
[01:56:55] Odell Cubbage: .//second one was really good
[01:56:58] Odell Cubbage: .//the entire premise
[01:57:08] Odell Cubbage: .//starting around city 8, there's a lot of weird alien activity going on
[01:57:09] Odell Cubbage: .//sprites
[01:57:33] Odell Cubbage: .//uhhh, race x shit showing up, weird xenians
[01:57:41] Odell Cubbage: .//portals coming from nowhere
[01:57:43] Odell Cubbage: .//super weird
[01:57:47] Odell Cubbage: .//btw i'm over simplifying
[01:58:17] Odell Cubbage: .//in the outlands in c08, this big red vortex is seen. Like probably 20 yards in diameter.
[01:58:18] Odell Cubbage: .//or so
[01:58:43] Odell Cubbage: .//rebels and overwatch is just astounded and confused
[01:59:17] Odell Cubbage: .//one of the things that get phased into reality is this ex black mesa scientist who was stranded on xen with a guard and another scientist
[01:59:27] Odell Cubbage: .//he's as confused as everyobdy else, other than
[01:59:28] Odell Cubbage: .//yknow
[01:59:29] Odell Cubbage: .//PTSD
[01:59:48] Odell Cubbage: .//he becomes valuable to the rebels, but still is too sheepish to talk about it
[01:59:52] Odell Cubbage: .//name is jay stelly by the way
[02:00:10] Odell Cubbage: .//eventually a fire starts in the central science building
[02:00:16] Odell Cubbage: .//theough the chaos a few maniacs run in
[02:00:25] Odell Cubbage: .//grab this strange sample that notes say came from the vortex
[02:00:35] Odell Cubbage: .//after a bit of consideration, like a couple days, they throw it in the vortex
[02:00:43] Odell Cubbage: .//boom, it compresses and it's gone
[02:00:53] Odell Cubbage: .//then more disturbances come, a lotmore aliens, a lot more sprites
[02:01:05] Odell Cubbage: .//electromagnetic disturbances make the reactor go out of whack
[02:01:36] Odell Cubbage: .//C08 is in chaos at this point, we're talking race x aliens and xenians, including weird new ones that spit fire and frost
[02:01:42] Odell Cubbage: .//they evacuate
[02:01:49] Odell Cubbage: .//people are transferred to city 14
[02:01:52] Odell Cubbage: .//same shit keeps happening
[02:01:52] Odell Cubbage: /me would flick his wrist.
[02:02:00] Odell Cubbage: .//but this new alien is seen
[02:02:02] Odell Cubbage: .//rumored i guess
[02:02:50] Odell Cubbage: .//after a strange day of happenings and unexplainde mental anguish, this worm alien is seen in the plaza for just a moment, and everyone who sees it gets mental flashes of atrocities, unimaginable horror, followed by the combine claw.
[02:02:56] Odell Cubbage: .//yknow the combine emblem
[02:03:09] Odell Cubbage: .//people around the city have strange happenings
[02:04:05] Odell Cubbage: .//unexplainable happenings, just coming under mental spells of sadness, fear, anger, depression, anything like that
[02:04:26] Odell Cubbage: .//eventually this big vortigaunt-looking alien is seen around
[02:04:31] Odell Cubbage: .//holding this staff and blue armor
[02:04:33] Odell Cubbage: .//weird as shit
[02:04:48] Odell Cubbage: .//eventually he makes contact with humans, tells them about how the combine oppressed his race
[02:05:17] Odell Cubbage: .//recruits people to a group of anti-citizens
[02:05:47] Odell Cubbage: .//he tells them there's a xen crystal in city 14 somewhere in the precinct
[02:05:58] Odell Cubbage: .//they find it, gets part of it, and becomes far more powerful
[02:06:40] Odell Cubbage: .//uses his power to take over the broadcasting system, gives this eloquent speech on the evil of the combine
[02:06:44] Odell Cubbage: .//everyone is like what the fuck
[02:06:44] Odell Cubbage: /me would flick his wrist.
[02:06:52] Odell Cubbage: .//complete character turn, now he's this weird dick
[02:06:56] Odell Cubbage: .//very angry, irritable
[02:07:04] Odell Cubbage: .//eventually he goes back to the broadcast station, he's met by these two OTA
[02:07:17] Odell Cubbage: .//they manage to pierce the xen crystal on his staff, and he lets out this awful scream
[02:07:29] Odell Cubbage: .//his form drops, and it's the pale worm that showed up in the plaza
[02:07:31] Odell Cubbage: .//the kingpin
[02:07:57] Odell Cubbage: .//they kill it
[02:08:03] Odell Cubbage: .//post credit scene for the event
[02:08:06] Odell Cubbage: .//gman talks to the kingpin
[02:08:08] Odell Cubbage: .//he's pissed
[02:08:11] Odell Cubbage: .//ALSO
[02:08:12] Odell Cubbage: /me would flick his wrist.
[02:08:13] Odell Cubbage: .//REAL QUICKY
[02:08:17] Odell Cubbage: .//WE INVOLVE GMAN IN STUFF, yes
[02:08:18] Odell Cubbage: .//but
[02:08:18] Odell Cubbage: .//but
[02:08:19] Odell Cubbage: .//but
[02:08:23] Odell Cubbage: .//it's not stupid
[02:08:45] Odell Cubbage: .//we have a good arc decided for him, we have good motives for what he does, and we only use him when his arc intersects with what's happening in the server
[02:09:02] Odell Cubbage: .//we don't just use him to be like "haha i gman you are good rebel you go raid nexus i give you rogue assassin who you erp with"
[02:09:05] Odell Cubbage: .//it's not like that
[02:09:14] Odell Cubbage: .//anyways gman talks to him, kingpin isn't happy for some undisclosed reason
[02:09:33] Odell Cubbage: .//wait, no, sorry, gman did't talk to kingpin, i'm confusing something
[02:09:36] Odell Cubbage: .//fuck, i'm sorry
[02:09:39] Odell Cubbage: .//anyways
[02:09:55] Odell Cubbage: .//xen crystal was fucked with improperly right
[02:09:59] Odell Cubbage: .//shatters, and alien shit goes wild
[02:09:59] Odell Cubbage: /me would flick his wrist.
[02:10:08] Odell Cubbage: .//portal storms eminate and transport many people in the city to xen
[02:10:20] Odell Cubbage: .//they find the big bad villain of the campaign
[02:10:29] Odell Cubbage: .//it turns out, the nihilanth Gordon Freeman killed wasn't the last one
[02:10:33] Odell Cubbage: .//there was one more in hiding
[02:10:38] Odell Cubbage: .//and he wanted revenge against the combine
[02:10:51] Odell Cubbage: .//the kingpin was an agent of the nihilanth, who was seeking power and a way to use his psychic powers
[02:10:59] Odell Cubbage: .//the nihilanth 2 that is
[02:11:12] Odell Cubbage: .//they're like "oh sweet fuck"
[02:11:28] Odell Cubbage: .//luckily the sec got teleported, he knows about the nihilanth race in some way because he's like
[02:11:31] Odell Cubbage: .//the i5s of the UU
[02:11:37] Odell Cubbage: .//which is how we see sectorials in fact here
[02:11:39] Odell Cubbage: .//anyways
[02:11:44] Odell Cubbage: .//he's like "yeah that thing is bad"
[02:11:56] Odell Cubbage: .//sec knows what will kill it but citizens aren't allowed to see it
[02:12:16] Odell Cubbage: .//citizens with them and the units are told, "hey, we've got this experimental unit, but we've got to teleport it in."
[02:12:18] Odell Cubbage: .//really it's an advisor
[02:12:19] Odell Cubbage: .//but
[02:12:20] Odell Cubbage: .//yknow
[02:12:24] Odell Cubbage: .//not gonna give that up easy
[02:12:31] Odell Cubbage: .//doesn't want to lose people he can use to help him out
[02:12:55] Odell Cubbage: .//after xen traversing, they come across past black mesa outposts that they use to manipulate the dimensions rifts to bring over the advisor
[02:13:03] Odell Cubbage: .//nihilanth is tormented, but it's not enough
[02:13:19] Odell Cubbage: .//jay stelly, using the displacement cannon prototype they encountered on their xen travels, goes, "I know what I have to do."
[02:13:35] Odell Cubbage: .//does some fucking with on the displacer cannon, and jumps right into the nihilanth's open head flaps
[02:13:41] Odell Cubbage: .//nihilanth dies
[02:14:04] Odell Cubbage: .//success, they get sent back to earth
[02:14:10] Odell Cubbage: .//post credit scene after all the thank yous
[02:14:16] Odell Cubbage: .//gman is talking to the nihilanth
[02:14:29] Odell Cubbage: .//OH FUCK I FORGOT ONE BIG EVENT
[02:14:30] Odell Cubbage: .//fuck me
[02:14:53] Odell Cubbage: .//so before the big xen event, after we had gotten teleported, meanwhile, the nihilanth is doing his own shit
[02:14:59] Odell Cubbage: .//while we look for stuff to overthrow him
[02:15:04] Odell Cubbage: .//he's bombarding this very precinct, i17
[02:15:21] Odell Cubbage: .//to give the consul a piece of his mind, and get revenge on the combine by killing him
[02:15:27] Odell Cubbage: .//not that the consul was responsible but
[02:15:33] Odell Cubbage: .//it's symbolic to the nihilanth
[02:15:38] Odell Cubbage: .//we all play as king units fighting through aliens
[02:15:44] Odell Cubbage: .//we watch the consul die
[02:15:51] Odell Cubbage: .//and then yeah
[02:16:02] Odell Cubbage: .//we kill the nihilanth from xen, not on our king units, then post credit scene
[02:16:20] Odell Cubbage: .//gman is being his usual self, talking to the soon to be extinct nihilanth
[02:16:26] Odell Cubbage: .//nihilanth is pissed
[02:16:30] Odell Cubbage: .//"this wasn't the deal" and all this stuff
[02:16:39] Odell Cubbage: .//gman is like "you wanted revenge, you got it. i didn't promise anymore"
[02:16:43] Odell Cubbage: .//but in gman ways of saying it
[02:17:13] Odell Cubbage: .//he bids the nihilanth farewell, then turns to his left and talks to something/someone/somewhere unknown and says, "I have fulfilled my end."
[02:17:22] Odell Cubbage: .//and that was the end of the campaign
[02:17:25] Odell Cubbage: .//sweet fuck that was long winded
[02:17:49] Odell Cubbage: .//uhh yeah
[02:17:55] Anya Solovyov: .// it was very very cool
[02:17:57] Odell Cubbage: .//that was our one before the previous
[02:18:00] Odell Cubbage: .//thank you very much
[02:18:16] Odell Cubbage: .//we try to go all out for our campaigns
[02:18:28] Anya Solovyov: .// thats the only way to do a campaign
[02:18:32] Odell Cubbage: .//hell yeah
[02:18:35] Odell Cubbage: .//current one
[02:18:42] Odell Cubbage: .//it's not over but nearing the end
[02:18:50] Odell Cubbage: .//this was before the beta trial run of course
[02:19:00] Odell Cubbage: .//started with an event where everyone is playing as a grunt
[02:19:07] Odell Cubbage: .//as well as an orifnal and a suppressor because
[02:19:08] Odell Cubbage: .//yes
[02:19:10] Odell Cubbage: .//anyways
[02:19:47] Odell Cubbage: .//they're exploring the wasteland of parts of the usa
[02:19:53] Odell Cubbage: .//scanners picked up some government builing
[02:19:58] Odell Cubbage: .//they send over a small squad to deal with it
[02:20:03] Odell Cubbage: .//it was a USGS building
[02:20:16] Odell Cubbage: .//after entering, they figure out, "oh fuck, this isn't USGS."
[02:20:18] Odell Cubbage: .//"this is aperture."
[02:20:38] Odell Cubbage: .//after exploring, they find the body of cave johnson, still alive, in extended relaxation
[02:20:47] Odell Cubbage: .//commander is like, "dude, thaat's great, we want him alive
[02:20:52] Odell Cubbage: .//they retrieve hm
[02:21:13] Odell Cubbage: .//bring him back
[02:21:23] Odell Cubbage: .//of course, breen is EA now, he's replaced the dead consul
[02:21:29] Odell Cubbage: .//btw all the campaigns are in one big continuity
[02:21:31] Odell Cubbage: /pm echo DRINK
[02:21:33] Odell Cubbage: .//as you likely guessed
[02:21:53] Odell Cubbage: .//anyways
[02:22:05] Odell Cubbage: .//cave is brought to breen because, despite being batshit insane, he's brilliant
[02:22:15] Odell Cubbage: .//and despite the cimbine not knowing about all of his exploits
[02:22:55] Odell Cubbage: .//see: literally time travel, multiverse travel, portal gun, long fall boots, GLaDOS, all of the modern aperture facility in its entirety
[02:23:05] Odell Cubbage: .//you get the picture
[02:23:31] Odell Cubbage: .//cave, hating black mesa for kicking its ass in awards and such, is all angry to see breen is earth administrator
[02:23:31] Odell Cubbage: /me would flick his wrist.
[02:23:41] Odell Cubbage: .//breen makes an executive decision under the advisement of the advisors
[02:23:46] Odell Cubbage: .//tells him "look."
[02:24:27] Odell Cubbage: .//"you're a brilliant man, you do good work. let's put our differences aside and i'll put you in charge of a city"
[02:24:34] Odell Cubbage: .//cave says okay
[02:24:51] Odell Cubbage: .//and breen, not wanting to waste valuable units and citizens, sends all of its dumbfuck and general undesirables to City 17
[02:25:04] Odell Cubbage: .//cave is by far the funniest CA in history and will continue to have been
[02:25:31] Odell Cubbage: .//does regular broadcasts, makes CWU Science a thing to design experiments, cave does experiments on citizens (killing them)
[02:26:03] Odell Cubbage: .//thngs are goofy but good
[02:26:06] Odell Cubbage: .//not much is being done
[02:26:18] Odell Cubbage: .//simplifying a lot, cave is remembering a lot of his achievements and stuff
[02:26:30] Odell Cubbage: .//because extended relaxation for a long time is not good for the brain
[02:27:13] Odell Cubbage: .//they begin doing expeditions into the aperture facility after cave remembers where it was
[02:27:37] Odell Cubbage: .//they first find the GLaDOS system
[02:28:00] Odell Cubbage: .//desptite common misconception, GLaDOS as a whole was a way of pouring into a computer, not specifically one psycho comedian lady
[02:28:10] Odell Cubbage: .//they take it to city 17 for testing
[02:28:30] Odell Cubbage: .//they put cave's very shady assistant, stephen marliff, into it for testing, and it's too successfull
[02:28:33] Odell Cubbage: .//successful*
[02:28:54] Odell Cubbage: .//he goes full 079, taking control of OTA and causing general chaos with all combine systems
[02:29:05] Odell Cubbage: .//killing a lot of things btw
[02:29:15] Odell Cubbage: .//eventually people are forced to evac
[02:29:26] Odell Cubbage: .//but gunships that he had a hold over managed to take down the train
[02:29:31] Odell Cubbage: .//they got stuck in the canals
[02:29:49] Odell Cubbage: .//so, thing about the GLaDOS system, at leastin server lore, is that it needs a place to be physically
[02:29:53] Odell Cubbage: .//it needs to be centralized somewhere
[02:30:08] Odell Cubbage: .//they couldn't find it in the city, but after barricading in the canals, fighting, and going around
[02:30:22] Odell Cubbage: .//they come across this big ol slug thing flying right at them and freezing them
[02:30:22] Odell Cubbage: /me would flick his wrist.
[02:30:25] Odell Cubbage: .//then talking to them
[02:30:45] Odell Cubbage: .//he's monologuing in the typical "haha, i do science but also being bad is goofy haha" trope but not in a shitty way
[02:30:53] Odell Cubbage: .//talks about how much he hates cave
[02:31:11] Odell Cubbage: .//accidentally dips his arm in water and his systems flip the fuck outy
[02:31:20] Odell Cubbage: .//so our heroes retreat, thinking about what to do
[02:31:28] Odell Cubbage: .//the highest ranking dude there, i believve it was the sec as well
[02:31:35] Odell Cubbage: .//was like "hey, that's an experimental synth"
[02:31:40] Odell Cubbage: .//"it uses repulsor technology to fly"
[02:31:45] Odell Cubbage: .//yknow all this bullshit
[02:31:58] Odell Cubbage: .//they encounter a lone vort, the vort tells them about this rebel outpost to hide in
[02:32:04] Odell Cubbage: .//they go in it and hide, and hatch a plan
[02:32:12] Odell Cubbage: .//there was an open pipe in what was a narrow tunnel
[02:32:32] Odell Cubbage: .//so they fill that pipe with water, bait in the advisor, and dump water on it, and they're home free to shoot it to dead.
[02:32:39] Odell Cubbage: .//much roleplay later, it works.
[02:32:42] Odell Cubbage: .//advisor is killed
[02:32:55] Odell Cubbage: .//so stephen is dead because his physical representation is as well
[02:33:11] Odell Cubbage: .//or physical 
[02:33:15] Odell Cubbage: .//what do you call it
[02:33:18] Odell Cubbage: .//yknow
[02:33:24] Odell Cubbage: .//his physical fhost
[02:34:04] Odell Cubbage: .//they go back, things are back under control
[02:34:10] Odell Cubbage: .//more expeditions, they find the time travel appratus
[02:34:13] Odell Cubbage: .//they test it out
[02:34:23] Odell Cubbage: .//and it turns out i accidentally ripped off terminator without ever having seen terminator in my lif
[02:34:51] Odell Cubbage: .//after getting proof it works, they send this dude into the future to see the future of the combine
[02:35:00] Odell Cubbage: .//they find out earth is free and was liberated by this dude named gordon freeman
[02:35:08] Odell Cubbage: .//and this isn't my favorite plot choice, but
[02:35:14] Odell Cubbage: .//they send, and i'm not exaggerating
[02:35:38] Odell Cubbage: .//a shitfuck of loads of tittyshit fucktons of shitbitch of units to kill him at black mesa
[02:36:04] Odell Cubbage: .//but, because of causality, this means the nihilanth never died
[02:36:19] Odell Cubbage: .//meaning there was two ripe for repopulation
[02:36:23] Odell Cubbage: .//they didn't have to be so angry
[02:36:34] Odell Cubbage: .//so nihilanth 2 didn't want to kill the consul or ivnade earth at all
[02:36:43] Odell Cubbage: .//so the consul is now EA
[02:36:49] Odell Cubbage: .//because he never died
[02:36:54] Odell Cubbage: .// nobody has any fucking clue
[02:37:02] Odell Cubbage: .//but the vortigaunts dp
[02:37:03] Odell Cubbage: .//do
[02:37:14] Odell Cubbage: .//they go to these people they know are sworn rebels
[02:37:17] Odell Cubbage: .//tell them about what's going on
[02:37:30] Odell Cubbage: .//after hunting down resources they need, meaning larval extract
[02:37:39] Odell Cubbage: .//they bring over breen adn talk to him
[02:38:11] Odell Cubbage: .//tell him about what;s going on, and he's like "Well i guess it's a threat to my combine if i'm rightfully EA"
[02:38:30] Odell Cubbage: .//plus an implied part f breen that i won't directly mention
[02:38:30] Odell Cubbage: /me would flick his wrist.
[02:38:33] Odell Cubbage: .//only allude to
[02:38:53] Odell Cubbage: .//after having this weird moment mid onersation where the vortigaunt stares over breen's shoulder
[02:39:03] Odell Cubbage: .//for like 2 uninterrupted minutes
[02:39:07] Odell Cubbage: .//zero explanation why
[02:39:12] Odell Cubbage: .//vortigaunt asks to be alone
[02:39:49] Odell Cubbage: .//couple mins later breen says, "fine i'll work with you pieces of fuck, i'll call city 17 as insurgent and fget all overwatch forces in my control to march on c17
[02:40:17] Odell Cubbage: .//because he was a high up city 14 official at the time
[02:40:38] Odell Cubbage: .//it succeeds, and our heroes are escorted into the nexus to plant some C4 on the time machine
[02:40:54] Odell Cubbage: .//the C4, however, is just the clay, and no electrical components, so they have to activate it by activating the time machine.
[02:41:05] Odell Cubbage: .//so they wire it up to the time machine
[02:41:19] Odell Cubbage: .//it's about t blow up and cave comes in is like "I WON'T LET YOU RUIN MY WORK!"
[02:41:26] Odell Cubbage: .//angry stuff, then the C4 detonates
[02:41:30] Odell Cubbage: .//cave johnson is gone
[02:41:36] Odell Cubbage: .//not painted all over the wall
[02:41:41] Odell Cubbage: .//he's just not there
[02:41:45] Odell Cubbage: .//maybe disintegrated? who knows
[02:41:50] Odell Cubbage: .//post credit scene, a news report
[02:42:02] Odell Cubbage: .//cave johnson was missing for 2 weeks, then came back at the point of the time machine
[02:42:08] Odell Cubbage: .//shot two units dead in cold blood and fled the nexus
[02:42:12] Odell Cubbage: .//has been missing since
[02:42:16] Odell Cubbage: .//and that's our server lore

[10:05:56] Avery Meyer: I came down here with a group, though I don't really know where they went..
[10:06:27] Scott Jameson: Mm.. Yes.. Yes... Abandoned.. Left alone in the Hollows of these Tunnels... The Tunnels that Stretch many Miles under this horrid landscape...
[10:06:34] Scott Jameson: You... Your Group...

[10:09:01] Avery Meyer: You have ulterior motives too though, so can you really judge him for it?
[10:09:08] Scott Jameson: Mmm.. Not Judging..
[10:09:19] Scott Jameson: Simply Observing.. and *Wondering* what they are..
[10:09:35] Scott Jameson: I would never judge a Man if he.. Secretly worked *Against* the Combine..
[10:09:41] Scott Jameson: Or *Exploited* their means..

[10:10:11] Scott Jameson: As Honorable as a Sewer Rat can be..
[10:10:21] Avery Meyer: It's better than following them blindly.

[10:12:56] Scott Jameson: When Strong.. act *Weak.* When *Weak;* act Strong...
[10:13:36] Scott Jameson: /me *the Man would scribble more into his paper, hunching and sliding down onto the wall to take a breather, he'd be sopping wet from the Knees down from the amount of exploring he'd been doing.*

[10:16:46] Scott Jameson: Mm... I see... Well... Friend of Kodiak, where are you headed?
[10:17:15] Avery Meyer: I'm not really sure. I know I haven't explored every thing down here, so I guess I was just wandering.
[10:17:51] Scott Jameson: Mmm.. Odd Question... Do you happen to have any Crates to hold stuff with... I'm getting full on Bounty that the Sewers have gifted to me.. I require More.
[10:18:09] Avery Meyer: I have a couple, but they're all full of stuff.
[10:18:38] Scott Jameson: Mmm, what do you want for it? I will take it off of you.. Lighten the Load if you will.. Find a Nice Place for the Technology...
[10:19:31] Avery Meyer: You can have it if you need it, but it's still full of stuff.
