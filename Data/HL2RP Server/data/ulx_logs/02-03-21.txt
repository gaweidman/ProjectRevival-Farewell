[22:33:42] Marliu set the scale for Themself to 1
[22:33:46] Tyrone Black: /y The truth is our path to enlightenment and enlightenment is the only way to please the Spirits and the Great Administrator. He showed the path to light; we chose darkness. Instead of love, they chose hatred.

[22:34:36] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: /y All of you, stand down!
[22:34:38] Tyrone Black: /y I created the humans, and they had the potential to reach the stars, however, they squandered their gifts. They turned upon their fellow men out of arrogance and ignorance. They poisoned their minds with false ideas and beliefs.
[22:34:38] Andrew Philip: Don't attack it, cooperate with the vortiguant he is trying to help
[22:34:48] Marliu: You all suffer from something far more dangerous than you may comprehend.

[22:35:18] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: How did we do that?
[22:35:18] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: Judith?
[22:35:26] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: That was the one in the holding cell, right?
[22:35:27] Tyrone Black: /Y I was saddened by what I had created, for they had strayed so far from my path. I pleaded with them, saying 'Change your ways, or you will suffer my wrath.' But they did not listen.
[22:35:28] Marliu: You must go! You may ask questions later!
[22:35:30] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: We just got a objetive but it's that.

[22:36:17] Boz Hendricks: /y Haha!
[22:36:20] Tyrone Black: /y Instead of change, they chose to become more extreme. They began to kill each other, and the weakest went first. I saw that they had learned nothing. They had committed the greatest of all sins: they had forsaken the will of the Great Administrator.
[22:36:22] Andrew Philip: Yep
[22:36:26] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: // Can you allow the civvies to come just for fun
[22:36:28] Marliu: /y You must seek out the help of Odell Cubbage!

[22:42:51] Tyrone Black: /y Thus, the True humans lead the charge for a better tomorrow. They were met with heavy resistance from demonic forces. To protect the True humans, I imbued them with my power, making them stronger and faster than normal humans.

[22:45:04] Judith Mossman: Fine.
[22:45:06] Judith Mossman: Okay.
[22:45:11] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: there's a Xenien that can change the laws of gravity
[22:45:14] Tyrone Black: /y Once I had done that, I would raise up the Great Administrators of the past, as well as the brave human souls residing in the off-world locations. These souls would help humanity progress at an accelerated rate, directly under my guidance.
[22:45:21] Artyom Kuznetsov: The fuck are we here for?
[22:45:24] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: Is classification really the most important thing?
