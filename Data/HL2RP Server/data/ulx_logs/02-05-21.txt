[14:29:52] CCA.C17-RCT.31328: What?
[14:30:17] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.93347: When they were trainin' you and gave you your rank, did they ever ask what division you were interested in?
[14:30:25] CCA.C17-RCT.31328: Nope
[14:30:29] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.93347: Hm. Noted.
[14:30:31] CCA.C17-RCT.31328: Though I am Interested in Helix
[14:30:43] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.93347: Oh that's a good one.
[14:30:47] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.93347: We need more of em'.
[14:30:52] CCA.C17-RCT.31328: Yep
[14:31:21] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.93347: I'm not jumping on the Helix train, I'm more leaning towards Grid.
[14:31:27] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.93347: Whenever I can do one of the damn trials that is.
[14:31:41] CCA.C17-RCT.31328: I'm waiting for the same
[14:32:04] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.93347: I've already sent a bunch of letters to the divisional on his desk, tellin' em' I'm interested, but I've yet to hear back.
[14:32:16] CCA.C17-RCT.31328: Maybe that's the problem
[14:32:20] CCA.C17-RCT.31328: you keep fucking asking

[14:33:09] CCA.C17-RCT.31328: Well you're not, so just let him know once and leave it at that
[14:33:11] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.93347: I'm just doin' what he's tellin' me.
[14:33:18] CCA.C17-RCT.31328: He'll eventually come around
[14:33:28] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.93347: *Eventually...*

[14:33:48] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.93347: Since day one.
[14:34:01] CCA.C17-RCT.31328: Well maybe you were just destined to stick with Union
[14:34:18] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.93347: /me he begins scratching his facemask a bit, seemingly looking in thought
[14:34:51] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.93347: Oddly enough, the main reason I joined was to be jumpin' on the Grid train. Maybe they looked at that on my application - n' said fuck em'.
[14:35:09] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.93347: Oh well... I'll still keep trying.
[14:35:20] CCA.C17-RCT.31328: Mhm
[14:36:14] CCA.C17-RCT.31328: I joined to kick ass
[14:36:18] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.93347: You done practicing at the range?
[14:36:25] CCA.C17-RCT.31328: Yeah
[14:36:27] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.93347: Well I mean, Likewise- but I had another *main* reason.

[14:36:45] CCA.C17-RCT.31328: Better Rations?
[14:37:17] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.93347: In a few ways like that I suppose. I used to work as a mechanic back in the day.
[14:37:34] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.93347: This is the closest thing to reunite me to that field.
[14:37:58] CCA.C17-RCT.31328: I Used to work at a hospital in North America

[14:39:17] CCA.C17-RCT.31328: Yeah
[14:39:36] CCA.C17-RCT.31328: Father was a Doctor, Wanted me to get involved in his profession
[14:39:49] CCA.C17-RCT.31328: I got paid worse than a Elementary School Lunch Lady
[14:40:18] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.93347: That sounds almost illegal. 
[14:40:33] CCA.C17-RCT.31328: What?
[14:40:42] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.93347: Not that it matters anymore,- oh the pay difference. 
[14:40:51] CCA.C17-RCT.31328: Yeah
[14:41:21] CCA.C17-RCT.31328: Being anything lower than a office worker typically didn't pay well
[14:42:22] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.93347: Huh. Well I made my ways through, you know the old sayin', 'If you do what you like, you'll never work a day in your life.' or somethin' like that.
[14:42:56] CCA.C17-RCT.31328: sounds fucking dumb
[14:43:03] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.93347: That's a summary of my life.
