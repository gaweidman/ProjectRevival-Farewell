[01:10:40] Lee Maylor: //some fucker registered the domain agor.io
[01:10:48] Lee Maylor: //and put in this jeff the killer jumpscare
[01:10:55] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc bruh
[01:10:56] Lee Maylor: //it was fucked
[01:11:02] Lee Maylor: //like i said the image isn't that bad
[01:11:12] Lee Maylor: //but it's one of those things where in a jumpscare how it was, it'll spook ya
[01:11:15] Lee Maylor: //but yeah my age
[01:11:17] Lee Maylor: //holy shit
[01:11:25] Lee Maylor: //it was crazy because it wasn't like a scream
[01:11:31] Lee Maylor: //it was this loud as shit like BRRRRRRRRRR noise
[01:11:37] Lee Maylor: //it was literally "Haha jumpscare go brrrrr"
[01:11:41] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc back then I grinded the shit out of FNAF so jumpscares wouldnt affect me all that much
[01:11:44] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc it worked
[01:11:47] Lee Maylor: //nice, nice
[01:11:54] Lee Maylor: //fnaf 2 was hella fun
[01:11:57] Lee Maylor: //it was the one i got into
[01:12:02] Lee Maylor: //best thing i can compare it to is
[01:12:04] Lee Maylor: //snip the fuckin uh
[01:12:09] Lee Maylor: //the glock shooting sound effect from CSS
[01:12:17] Lee Maylor: //snip it to like a quarter second long, if that
[01:12:21] Lee Maylor: //back to back
[01:12:24] Lee Maylor: //super loud
[01:12:28] Lee Maylor: //anyways yeah
[01:12:33] Lee Maylor: //that'll do it, that'll hlep it
[01:12:42] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc ye ill try that out out of curiosity
[01:12:52] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc FNAF 2 and 3 were my main ones
[01:12:56] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc 3 wasn't that bad tbh
[01:13:09] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc just the animatronic models were a lil creepier than general
[01:13:36] Lee Maylor: //3 wasn't super bad but that one kinda gave me the creeps just because of the aesthetic
[01:13:43] Lee Maylor: //springtrap's design was really cool though
[01:13:47] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc yea it was
[01:14:07] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc ive never tried sister location, havent even seen any footage of it other than trailer
[01:14:29] Lee Maylor: //it's actually not bad
[01:14:37] Lee Maylor: //my biggest problem is i haven't got past fucking night 4
[01:14:44] Lee Maylor: //i tried to grind it and i couldn't FUCKING DO IT
[01:14:53] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc difficult?
[01:14:59] Lee Maylor: //yeah
[01:15:06] Lee Maylor: //not bad though
[01:15:12] Lee Maylor: //FFPS was a lot of fun
[01:15:18] Lee Maylor: //the tycoon part was gamer
[01:15:40] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc their VR spinoff seems interesting too
[01:15:57] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc but honestly thatd make the jumpscares as bad as it was back when i was a kid
[01:16:03] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc simply because its VR
[01:16:13] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc well it supports it
[01:16:15] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc but eh
[01:16:40] Lee Maylor: //true, true
[01:16:46] Lee Maylor: //back when fnaf first came though like
[01:16:48] Lee Maylor: //damn
[01:16:54] Lee Maylor: //came out*
[01:16:59] Lee Maylor: //that shit was groundbreaking
[01:17:07] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc definitely
[01:17:43] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc i tried UCN a few times
[01:17:56] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc pretty nice being able to turn all animatronics up to 20 and speedrun death
[01:18:11] Lee Maylor: //lmao good way of putting it
[01:18:14] Lee Maylor: //ngl UCN was a lot of fun
[01:18:28] Lee Maylor: //fresh take on FNAF
[01:18:37] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc ye
[01:18:42] Lee Maylor: //but holy fuck can we talk about how bad the scraptrap/afton model is
[01:18:45] Lee Maylor: //like damn
[01:19:00] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc yea i agree its just really iff
[01:19:02] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc off
[01:19:40] Lee Maylor: //doesn't hit the same
[01:19:52] Lee Maylor: //but UCN was cool. having the VCs was great
[01:19:55] Lee Maylor: //something i didn't know i'd like
[01:20:16] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc as you said, fresh take that worked
[01:20:50] Lee Maylor: //absolutely absolutely
[01:20:59] Lee Maylor: //i used to be super into the lore too
[01:21:08] Lee Maylor: //the games are good but going through the lore was fun
[01:21:47] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc yeah ive seen a bit of the lore and it definitely does draw an interesting landscape of it all
[01:22:30] Lee Maylor: //it's funny though becuase you can tell he never really had shit planned
[01:22:30] Lee Maylor: /me would flick his wrist.
[01:22:33] Lee Maylor: //and just sorta made it up as he went
[01:22:36] Lee Maylor: //but it wasn't bad
[01:22:41] Lee Maylor: //it gets a bit.. janky... way late on
[01:22:46] Lee Maylor: //but otherwise it's really cool
[01:23:07] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc yeah, could use ironing but still interesting to dive into
[01:23:58] Lee Maylor: //agree
[01:24:02] Lee Maylor: //really cool way of storytelling
[01:24:09] Lee Maylor: //it's where i get some of my inspiration for the serever
[01:24:10] Lee Maylor: //server
[01:24:15] Lee Maylor: //as far as obscurity for stories and such
[01:24:16] Lee Maylor: /me would flick his wrist.
[01:24:21] Lee Maylor: //that and gravity falls
[01:24:25] Lee Maylor: //gamer as shit show
[01:24:53] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc i never saw it but i know some people that love it
[01:26:52] Lee Maylor: //it is absolutely amazing
[01:26:58] Lee Maylor: //Kid's show, but it's still goo
[01:27:13] Lee Maylor: //It does a great job at creating mystery and suspense.
[01:27:31] Lee Maylor: //great characters, great story, great reveal, everything. it's all good
[01:27:55] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc i might have to check it out
[01:28:00] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc an excuse to watch TV lmao
[01:28:25] Lee Maylor: //hell yea
[01:28:32] Lee Maylor: //i'm not much of a TV guy but it's worth a watch
[01:28:42] Lee Maylor: //i'm getting my girlfriend to watch it
[01:28:54] Lee Maylor: //so now I get to watch it with her over again, and it's still super good the second time
[01:29:04] Lee Maylor: //because you see all the *S Tier* Foreshadowing
[01:29:23] Lee Maylor: //things that fly right over your head normally but your second time you shit yourself
[01:29:43] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc Yeah, way i see it, you might catch things you never noticed whether it be just visual or story-related during a second rewatch 
[01:30:40] Lee Maylor: //yeah. it's exactly like that
[01:30:42] Lee Maylor: //really good
[01:31:08] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc oh fuck its 1:30
