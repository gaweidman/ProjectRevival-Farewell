[14:08:58] Teressa 'Tess' Richards: yeah the more containers we have the better, so we dont have to keep dumping out our stuff.
[14:09:03] Andrew Philip: wait
[14:09:12] Andrew Philip: we need a blow torch...

[14:14:07] Andrew Philip: but first
[14:14:14] Andrew Philip: we need to see if this actually is a good idea
[14:14:20] Andrew Philip: otherwise we will need to make our own from scratch
[14:14:29] Teressa 'Tess' Richards: slow down, what are you trying to do?
[14:14:49] Andrew Philip: instead of making one, and needing a blow torch we are repurpose this vending machine
[14:15:05] Teressa 'Tess' Richards: and why are we trying to get a vending machine?
