[15:13:13] Teressa 'Tess' Richards: well it's a barbaque might as well go all out
[15:13:31] Andrew Philip: oh my
[15:13:43] Andrew Philip: I think we also have enough to make a home-made filter
[15:14:08] Andrew Philip: the only thing that can make this better is a air exchange machine
[15:14:18] Andrew Philip: the only thing that can make this better is a air exchange machine
[15:14:29] Andrew Philip: so we don't have to use the filters all the damn time
[15:14:40] Teressa 'Tess' Richards: oh yeah I was gonna talk to you about trying to get one of those.
[15:15:01] Andrew Philip: I don't have enough knowledge to create one
[15:15:05] Andrew Philip: or even obtain one
[15:15:24] Andrew Philip: maybe the motor is the first step
[15:15:57] Teressa 'Tess' Richards: maybe the union would just give us one.
[15:16:03] Andrew Philip: Impossible
[15:16:24] Andrew Philip: if I can a homemade filter we can make one of our own though 
[15:16:30] Andrew Philip: do you have any water cans?
[15:16:41] Teressa 'Tess' Richards: there's two on the table
[15:16:43] Andrew Philip: empty ones rather
[15:16:48] Teressa 'Tess' Richards: well no
[15:16:57] Teressa 'Tess' Richards: I have an empty bottle
[15:17:02] Andrew Philip: hmp
[15:17:19] Andrew Philip: No I need a Metal one
[15:17:31] Teressa 'Tess' Richards: we could reinforce it with metal.
[15:18:00] Teressa 'Tess' Richards: actually wait
[15:18:04] Andrew Philip: hm
[15:18:10] Teressa 'Tess' Richards: I forgot I had this

[15:18:40] Andrew Philip: /looc void that for now
[15:18:46] Andrew Philip: perfect
[15:19:07] Andrew Philip: I'll try and make one later though
[15:19:10] Andrew Philip: /looc again, admino
[15:19:36] Andrew Philip: there is other rooms
[15:20:06] Teressa 'Tess' Richards: we could use one of these as a barrack.
[15:20:14] Andrew Philip: I was thinking that but
[15:20:23] Andrew Philip: this here has enough space for barracks
[15:20:29] Andrew Philip: for like 14 or more people
[15:20:42] Andrew Philip: I was thinking this more of a Medbay
[15:20:51] Teressa 'Tess' Richards: hmmm
[15:21:11] Teressa 'Tess' Richards: and this one?
[15:21:16] Andrew Philip: hm
[15:21:31] Andrew Philip: we have a armory/workshop
[15:21:38] Andrew Philip: we have a command room and a medbay
[15:21:52] Andrew Philip: we can split the barracks, cooking area, water purfier and misc stuff in the middle
[15:21:55] Andrew Philip: here can be...
[15:21:59] Andrew Philip: storage area?
[15:22:21] Teressa 'Tess' Richards: oh yeah speaking about an armory what about those weapon and armor scraps we found?
[15:22:31] Andrew Philip: They are in one of my lockers
[15:22:46] Andrew Philip: you have a use for them?
[15:23:19] Teressa 'Tess' Richards: well I haven't really got in to the weapon manufacturing business but we got to do something with em
[15:23:28] Andrew Philip: Not yet
[15:23:40] Andrew Philip: right now I've seen 9mm ammo being left effective then the axes we have
[15:23:47] Andrew Philip: it takes 20 bullets to get an antlion
[15:23:55] Teressa 'Tess' Richards: still safer
[15:23:57] Andrew Philip: it takes one swig to kill an antlion on the head
[15:24:18] Teressa 'Tess' Richards: then we should atleast be thinking about armor.
[15:24:34] Andrew Philip: yeah the armor can be great, but we'd need to invest it and use it on the right things
[15:24:48] Andrew Philip: maybe mugging a Civil Protection can be good but its the highest risk
[15:24:57] Andrew Philip: and we can barely kill a zombine
[15:25:34] Teressa 'Tess' Richards: speak for yourself i'm quite effiecient in zombie slaying
[15:25:52] Andrew Philip: Zombine...
[15:26:08] Teressa 'Tess' Richards: ah I thought you said zombie
[15:26:24] Andrew Philip: I've managed to kill 2 Zombines today actually
[15:26:36] Andrew Philip: one of them dropped 9mm ammo with an active grenade, I couldn't take it
[15:26:47] Teressa 'Tess' Richards: not all of us have a death wish though
[15:26:48] Andrew Philip: another one dropped shotgun ammo, with a live grenande, couldn't take it
[15:27:01] Andrew Philip: and that too
[15:27:09] Andrew Philip: so yeah I don't know
[15:27:17] Andrew Philip: I don't think we can mug a CP unless we get a secret tunnel
[15:27:29] Andrew Philip: and I can make a pickaxe if we find a Welder or a Torch
[15:27:32] Teressa 'Tess' Richards: b-but having armor would be so cool
[15:28:14] Andrew Philip: After the Tunnel Teressa, better safe then sorry
[15:28:18] Teressa 'Tess' Richards: we could be like secret agent vigilante's
[15:28:28] Andrew Philip: oh yes
[15:28:39] Andrew Philip: that is going to be good
[15:28:46] Teressa 'Tess' Richards: it's gonna be sick
[15:29:53] Andrew Philip: here
[15:30:16] Andrew Philip: you could try and have a crack at crafting a weapon or a armor for yourself
[15:30:24] Andrew Philip: but if you end up not knowing how I can too
