[01:06:15] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: I believe it was ECHO.

[01:06:28] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: honestly, I wish I could become an OTA
[01:06:40] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: Yeah, that thought has crossed my mind too.
[01:07:01] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: though I'm not sure how I feel about the augmentations
[01:07:20] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: Yeah, then again I guess its to enhance their ability, but either way.
[01:07:34] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: Can't think of any other reason why they'd get em.
[01:07:38] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: It just sounds painful
[01:08:07] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: Right? The process to, can't imagine it.

[01:08:25] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: Don't ever want to learn that process.
[01:08:44] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: could always ask a HELIX
[01:08:50] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: or an OTA if you want to get in trouble
[01:08:56] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: Heh.
[01:09:01] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: HELIX would know?
[01:09:13] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: well yeah
[01:09:23] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: HELIX are medics
[01:09:35] Client "spwweicu" connected.
[01:09:47] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: Augmentations are in their area
[01:10:02] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: so is unionwashing, memory replacements, and medical assistance
[01:10:25] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: I see. I figured that the process would differ from others, if there are any other methods even.
[01:10:39] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: So HELIX would know one way and others would know the other.
[01:10:57] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: what do you mean?
[01:11:21] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: Wouldn't the augmentations vary in complexity and "class" depending on what unit gets them?
[01:11:33] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: they do, I believe.
[01:11:46] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: They're given at DvL, I think.
[01:11:51] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: Figured.
[01:12:21] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: What I'm thinking is that HELIX would handle the more basic augmentations, while things like automated UU machinery and such handles the stuff for the OTA that are... well, up there.
[01:12:35] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: Then again, I don't know how all that works, just speculation.
[01:12:45] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: honestly, no clue either
[01:12:56] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: only thing I've experienced first hand is union-washing
[01:13:07] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: Never experienced it, considering it.
[01:13:28] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: That's available off the bat for i5s and such, right?
[01:13:37] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: yeah, volunteer

[01:14:04] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: i2 or I1
[01:14:08] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: Makes sense.
[01:14:18] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: I might try and get that done, considering recent circumstances too.
[01:14:46] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: I don't see why you woudln't, it doesn't hurt.
[01:14:57] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: What's it even like?

[20:49:05] Todd Muller: /me Looks around for a moment, then leaning against the fence, whilst itching the back of his neck.

[20:49:28] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: /me Simply stands at a relaxed state, keeping an eye on most parts of the room.
[20:49:51] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: /me slid his suit off, leaning against the fence.

[20:50:28] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: So not exactly the best.
[20:50:30] CPT Nathan Vance: Alright.
[20:50:34] CPT Nathan Vance: Let's get this started.
[20:50:39] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: Another day in '17, aye?
[20:50:44] CPT Nathan Vance: So, first off, we'll softball it to you. What is the Universal Union?
[20:50:45] Miles Anderson: yeah I saw that, pretty crazy.
[20:50:46] Todd Muller: Hm, hard one. The only thing bad that's happened today is that like.. A hour or two ago me and some others were stuck in a building during some sort of... Antlion attack.
[20:50:46] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: /me Chuckles at the remark.
[20:50:55] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: Yeah, most days in 17 are like that.
[20:51:15] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: Ah, you were one of the civvies trapped in the CMB?
[20:51:24] Todd Muller: Yes I was.
[20:51:29] Morgan Beck: The fuck?
[20:51:31] Miles Anderson: how'd you manage that?
[20:51:34] Keith Schmidt: It is the superior force of this planet, sir. It is who we assist for a better future.
[20:51:42] Morgan Beck: Who the fuck's been in here?
[20:51:47] CPT Nathan Vance: Alright.
[20:51:50] Morgan Beck: /toggleraise
[20:51:54] Morgan Beck: /toggleraise
[20:51:57] CPT Nathan Vance: Now, what is the Human Conscripted Military?
[20:52:03] Todd Muller: Me and another person were helping this doctor guy with some things when the antlions attacked and we got locked in a room.
[20:52:05] CPT Nathan Vance: Other than, "It's what the conscripts belong to."
[20:52:09] CPT Nathan Vance: What actually *is* it?
[20:52:42] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: Me and some UNION saved them during the breach.
[20:52:51] Todd Muller: If I had to rate it.. I'd give it a... Four out of 10. Happy I made it out of that.
[20:52:56] Adachi Tetsuo: /ooc conscript apps happening?
[20:53:00] Morgan Beck: // Yup
[20:53:00] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: // yes
[20:53:01] CPT Nathan Vance: //yep
[20:53:04] Morgan Beck: // Lobby of the Nexus
[20:53:05] Keith Schmidt: It is the human militaristic alliance to the Universal Union.
[20:53:13] CPT Nathan Vance: Care to go into more detail?
[20:53:32] Miles Anderson: What about the doctor? couldn't he have have let you out?
[20:53:49] Adachi Tetsuo: /me awkwardly slides into line, acting like he was there the whole time
[20:53:49] Todd Muller: There was a antlion, right outside our door.
[20:53:50] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: 'Aye there.
[20:53:53] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: There was an antlion, if they went out it would have torn them to shreds.
[20:53:54] Keith Schmidt: Sir? I'm not sure I understand the question.
[20:54:04] CPT Nathan Vance: We'll just move on.
[20:54:05] Miles Anderson: Ah, so thats what you meant by locked in.
[20:54:10] Todd Muller: Yep.
[20:54:15] CPT Nathan Vance: What is the difference between Conscripts and Civil Protection Units?
[20:54:50] Miles Anderson: question, you apply for conscription or were you a soldier before the war?
[20:54:57] Miles Anderson: or sorry liberation I guess.
[20:55:07] Keith Schmidt: We are not metropolitcan forces sir. We assist the Civil Protection in their job when needed.
[20:55:13] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: I simply applied for it.
[20:55:24] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: Had an interest pre-war but the Combine took over.
[20:55:35] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: So I might as well join up with it's new military.
[20:55:43] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: Your stories?
[20:55:54] CPT Nathan Vance: Don't get ahead of yourself. There is no *we* yet.
[20:56:01] Keith Schmidt: /me nods.
[20:56:21] CPT Nathan Vance: And yes, I know conscripts are not the Civil Protection units. That's why I'm asking you what the difference is.
[20:56:30] CPT Nathan Vance: What do conscripts do that Civil Protection doesn't, and vice versa?
[20:56:39] Miles Anderson: meh, just boring o'l life, used to make ends meet as a desk jockey before the war.
[20:56:49] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: /pm GRID you super busy right now?????
[20:56:55] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: Ah
[20:57:00] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: I was a Mechanic, Bartender too.
[20:57:08] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: /pm lazzy not at all
[20:57:23] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: /reply Then can you prop the Conscript barracks while the new guys are getting trained.
[20:57:42] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212 to admins: mind if i prop the conscript barracks?
[20:57:47] CPT Nathan Vance to admins: feel free
[20:57:49] CPT Nathan Vance: /chargiveflag i1 ncr
[20:57:59] Keith Schmidt: Civil Protection doesn't do special operations, they are the metropolitcan security and intelligence in urban environments. Conscripts help with special operations and missions when the Civil Protection can't handle it on their own.
[20:58:07] Adachi Tetsuo: I lived in Japan. I ran with the Yakuza a long time ago.

[20:58:38] Todd Muller: I had a... Meh life, I lived in a semi-good apartment. Meh job, but a dangerous area. I couldn't really go out for walks but now... I can go for a walk any time I want.
[20:58:40] CPT Nathan Vance: Keep in mind the answer doesn't always have to be long winded. It could be something simple.
[20:58:51] Miles Anderson: the yakuza huh...pretty sure they made a game about them.
[20:59:05] Keith Schmidt: Conscripts are still organic and human, they are not heavily augmented like an OTA soldier would be.
[20:59:12] CPT Nathan Vance: alright
[20:59:27] CPT Nathan Vance: Are conscripts citizens?
[20:59:34] Keith Schmidt: No.

[21:39:23] CPT Nathan Vance: /chargiveitem vance "conscript filter" 7
[21:39:27] "Wilbur": /me would eat each piece of crumbled chip slowly one by one, becoming more and more satisfied in hunger.
[21:39:32] Morgan Beck: // The real twist is that you saw the magazine in half.
[21:39:33] CPT Nathan Vance teleported to Todd Muller
[21:39:55] Morgan Beck: I wonder if geese are still alive.
[21:39:58] Morgan Beck: Probably not.
[21:40:01] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: // In WW2 they already thought it was a good idea of putting a light infantry rifle chambered in .308 on full auto because fuck it.
[21:40:02] CPT Nathan Vance: Alright, that'll do it.
[21:40:06] Todd Muller: Okay.
[21:40:08] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: // So I wouldn't be suprised.
[21:40:27] "Wilbur": /me looks up at the human for a moment, then goes back to the can, finishing the chip it chose to poke at.
[21:40:31] CPT Nathan Vance: What's your name?
[21:40:37] Miles Anderson: Miles Anderson.
[21:40:44] CPT Nathan Vance: //why can't you use 9mm ammo in a 50 caliber, it's smaller, it fits
[21:40:47] Morgan Beck: // today I am going to saw off a 50 cal sniper
[21:40:52] CPT Nathan Vance: //also how many calibers are in a millimeter
[21:40:54] Miles Anderson: /looc was watching a guy shoot off door hinges
[21:41:00] "Wilbur": /me would go back to pecking the can.
[21:41:01] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: // facepalm.
[21:41:02] Morgan Beck: /me watched the bird quietly.
[21:41:04] CPT Nathan Vance: Alright, come with me.
[21:41:12] CPT Nathan Vance: //shhh, watch lazarus get triggered
[21:41:14] Miles Anderson: alright
[21:41:31] Morgan Beck: Uh, howdy Officer.
[21:41:38] Todd Muller: /looc Alright, I have to head out. Goodnight. I'll be back on tomorrow. 
[21:41:40] "Wilbur": /me stops and stares at the can for a moment. It would raise its head up, then slam its beak back into the can.
[21:41:40] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: // I am currently just sitting in my chair thinking of insults that I can't use.

[21:42:26] Miles Anderson: yes.
[21:42:26] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212 to admins: wouldn't the bird cut itself with the edges of the can

[21:42:42] CPT Nathan Vance: What is the Universal Union?
[21:42:45] "Wilbur": /me squawks at the can, and goes back to generally pecking the can in the unaffected areas.
[21:42:46] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: .// OH
[21:43:17] Morgan Beck: /it The can was fairly battle damaged at this point, now with a gaping hole right in the middle of the UU symbol on the can.

[21:43:51] Morgan Beck to admins: Status on apps?

[21:44:18] Morgan Beck: // ^
[21:44:21] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: // ^
[21:44:28] "Wilbur": /me dissatisifed with the damage done, would do the same thing again: raise its head, and slam its beak back into the can.

[21:44:58] Morgan Beck: // Fuck Micky. Probably spreads the Black Death or some shit
[21:45:09] Morgan Beck: /it The can barely moved with that impact.
[21:45:29] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: // I will hunt Micky and his entire species down with a Groza-1.
[21:45:33] CPT Nathan Vance: //just play toontown rewritten, problem solved
[21:45:40] "Wilbur": /me would angrily squawk at the can, pecking it in the general area for a little bit.
[21:46:02] Miles Anderson: Human conscripts started off as the remnants of the human military being conscripted into military service for the union.
[21:46:02] "Wilbur": /me would commit banzai with its head into the can again, not before squawking again as if it were a battle cry.
[21:46:04] "Wilbur": /rollstat str
[21:46:07] "Wilbur": /looc fuck
[21:46:14] CPT Nathan Vance: alright
[21:46:24] CPT Nathan Vance: What does it do, though?
[21:46:37] Morgan Beck: /it The bird just missed this time. So much for having the eyesight required to pick up mice off the ground. Or seeing tiny molecules of bread crumbs.
[21:46:48] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: // Crungle cringle croongel creengle
[21:47:01] Morgan Beck: // you better not be dissing toontown
[21:47:06] "Wilbur": /me squawks angrily again at the can, staring at it for a little bit, contemplating another strategy.
[21:47:48] Morgan Beck: /me would position himself in a way to get a better view. This was the most intertaining thing he'd seen in weeks.
[21:47:57] Miles Anderson: right, conscripts are basically lower ranking combine units as far know. They assist the combine in their duty.
[21:48:05] Miles Anderson: Thats as far as my knowledge go.
[21:48:08] Morgan Beck: /looc jesus fuck my spelling is taking a fat dump today
[21:48:10] Miles Anderson: /looc goes*
[21:48:16] "Wilbur": /me would shift itself in another position, and attempt the same attack again.
[21:48:18] CPT Nathan Vance: Alright.
[21:48:18] "Wilbur": /rollstat str
[21:48:24] "Wilbur": /looc same
[21:48:24] CPT Nathan Vance: What is the difference between Conscripts and Civil Protection Units?
[21:48:59] Morgan Beck: /it At least the bird hit this time. Can't say much for the impact though. The can did tip over due to the already ammassed damage, now leaning on the bench slightly.
[21:49:40] "Wilbur": /me would move around a bit to compensate for where the can would be now, angrily squawking.
[21:49:47] Miles Anderson: I believe conscripts are not augmented when they climb the ranks. 
[21:50:02] CPT Nathan Vance: And that's the difference you can think of?
[21:50:04] Morgan Beck: What're you gonna do now?
[21:50:30] "Wilbur": /me would tilt its head slightly and jab its beak into the can again, but at a slighter angle. It didn't intend to pierce it, more so move it so it isn't leaning on it.
[21:50:32] "Wilbur": /rollstat str
[21:50:43] Morgan Beck: // fuck I forgot I had Travis Scott falling off stage in autotune in my music playlist
[21:50:48] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: // LMAO
[21:50:48] Morgan Beck: // what a great video.
[21:51:19] CPT Nathan Vance: //eee-yay
[21:51:32] Miles Anderson: hmm.... well i'm sure that leaves more of a threat for corruption but it also leaves higher cognitive thinking.
[21:51:33] Morgan Beck: /it What a strike! The can may of not been pierced like last time, but the bodyweight of the bird caused a prettttyyy big dent in the side of the can.
[21:51:36] Miles Anderson: I don't really know.
[21:51:47] Morgan Beck: // "YUH DEAD, ny-eahh"
[21:52:09] CPT Nathan Vance: alright..
[21:52:11] "Wilbur": /looc who would win: conscript application rp vs bird combat rp
[21:52:20] CPT Nathan Vance: What is the difference between Conscripts and Overwatch Soldiers?
[21:52:27] Morgan Beck: /looc birdcombatRP in a heartbeat
[21:52:27] CPT Nathan Vance to admins: how do you guys feel about frazzy's RP?
[21:52:41] Morgan Beck to admins: I feel like that name is familiar
[21:52:42] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212 to admins: He's a good RP'er 100%
[21:52:56] Morgan Beck to admins: And the name didn't set off any red flags for me so ye.
[21:52:57] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: // UNGA BUNGA DUMBO DUMBY
[21:53:06] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: // Please ban me
[21:53:11] "Wilbur": /me would squawk as if it was a victory, but knew the war wasn't over. The can spoke to the bird almost, as if it refused to surrender to the bird. It would attempt the same side-jab strategy with its beak, coming in from another angle.
[21:53:13] "Wilbur": /rollstat str
[21:53:21] CPT Nathan Vance: //sure, go get on a citizen and press the consul's office buttons
[21:53:24] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: // Bet
[21:53:39] CPT Nathan Vance: //holy shit the system already autobanned someone
[21:53:46] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: // Yep
[21:53:48] "Wilbur": /ooc youre shitting me
[21:53:53] Miles Anderson: I believe conscripts get their hands dirty a lot more often then the OTA forces.
[21:54:01] CPT Nathan Vance: //not at all, look in #general here in a sec
[21:54:12] Morgan Beck: /it This was the surest strike. The can was completely poked through, the beak barely poking through the other side of the can.
[21:54:23] CPT Nathan Vance: Alright.
[21:54:29] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212 is friends with PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus, CPT Nathan Vance
[21:54:30] CPT Nathan Vance: Are conscripts citizens?
[21:54:36] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus is friends with CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212, Morgan Beck
[21:55:01] Morgan Beck to admins: Do we have ban appeals set up? I ask because the autoban system could probably ban someone by accident.
[21:55:17] "Wilbur": /me would squawk again seeing its new victory in succession to the last. Seeing one last major spot of the can untouched, it shifted its focus to that, readjusting itself for another battle.
[21:55:20] Miles Anderson: can you ellaborate more about what you mean by that?
[21:55:26] CPT Nathan Vance to admins: it doesn't ban by accident
[21:55:35] CPT Nathan Vance: Are they citizens?
[21:55:39] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: // This is taking ten years.
[21:55:42] CPT Nathan Vance: Are they treated like citizens?
[21:55:44] CPT Nathan Vance: //they always do
[21:55:44] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: // Explain yourself Q!
[21:55:49] Morgan Beck to admins: Well I mean, just incase.
[21:55:54] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: // This feels like it's taking longer than usual
[21:56:02] CPT Nathan Vance: //more people
[21:56:03] Morgan Beck: // Because we have more people on the server.
[21:56:03] CPT Nathan Vance: //more time
[21:56:07] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: // fair
[21:56:16] "Wilbur": /me learning that coming in at an angle was a successful idea, it would jab its beak into the can at a similar angle to see its effectiveness, or if a new strategy needs to be thought of using the small but confident brain.
[21:56:18] "Wilbur": /rollstat sttr
[21:56:27] Morgan Beck: // Once we have people to fill high up command roles, apps will be a lot better at least for the future.
[21:56:34] CPT Nathan Vance: //^
[21:56:54] CPT Nathan Vance to admins: if that happens, they can shoot me a DM and say there was an issue. if there's a valid reason in RP for a citizen to be up there and pressing buttons, we'll cross that bridge when we get to it
[21:57:12] CPT Nathan Vance to admins: i won't make someone write several paragraphs because of a false positive
[21:57:24] Miles Anderson: Of course I don't think they'll be treated in the same as normal citizens but I don't think that they'll be treated as highly as an OTA unit or maybe even Civil protection officer.
[21:57:28] Morgan Beck: /it The beak kinda nearly went into one of the holes again, but barely clipped, making it like, a centimeter extra wide.
[21:57:32] Morgan Beck to admins: Alright.
[21:57:45] Morgan Beck: // God, I yearn for the day of players actually being able to host apps.
[21:57:48] CPT Nathan Vance: ...Right.

[21:58:01] CPT Nathan Vance: //we can do that
[21:58:04] CPT Nathan Vance: Name a job a conscript may have.

[21:58:13] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: // ollie are you implying q isn't a person
[21:58:20] Morgan Beck: // Yes.
[21:58:23] CPT Nathan Vance: //i'm only ceremonially a person
[21:58:33] Morgan Beck: // He's a programmer. We all know that programmers are synths.
[21:58:45] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: // q is a scanner
[21:58:48] CPT Nathan Vance: //no, you're thinking of IT. IT aren't people
[21:58:54] "Wilbur": /me squawks angrily at the can again, seeing its strategy somewhat worked but not to the extend it wished. 
[21:58:59] Miles Anderson: sweeping the sewers of rebels and xen life forms.
[21:59:03] Morgan Beck: // Then at least cybernetically enhanced.
[21:59:08] CPT Nathan Vance: Name any firearm used by the Conscripts.
[21:59:11] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: // i am actually *several* people
[21:59:15] Morgan Beck: I think the can is uh, already defeated.

[21:59:49] Miles Anderson: Well
[21:59:54] "Wilbur": /me does not hear the human as it was 100% fixated on the can. It would deliver one final strike, surely to put the can out of its metaphorical will to fight back.

[22:01:55] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: /w Yep
[22:02:00] Morgan Beck: /it The strike should've been the perfect angle, but there was a slight miscaluclation. Birds were never programmed to do math either way. I mean, who the hell pays attention to fuckin angles in high school? The strike ended with a dinky bang on the can.
[22:02:09] Miles Anderson: I believe I can be useful to the union though I am a bit hesitant to sign up with the CCA for various reasons.
[22:02:17] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: /fr We can just speak like this if you want to keep things between us.

[23:23:59] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: I got that unionwashing done today.
[23:24:05] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: oh yeah?

[23:24:17] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: Not as bad as I thought it'd be. Quick and fairly easy.
[23:24:19] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: // tfw 
[23:24:19] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They are special units called Quartermasters!

[23:24:35] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: Was a bit dizzy but that was mentioned as a result of it.
[23:24:36] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: // Great ratio

[23:26:12] CPT Nathan Vance: /y That way the traitorous bastards who make it in don't run off with our equipment.
[23:26:28] CPT Nathan Vance: /y Are you all familiar with all of the aliens and their terminologies?
[23:26:44] Adachi Tetsuo: No, sir!
[23:26:53] Miles Anderson: Not all of it, sir!
[23:26:56] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: .// I wanted a second training session and you motherfuckers took it away from me.

[23:27:05] Keith Schmidt: [[ almost had ya
[23:27:09] CPT Nathan Vance: .//i just said you could leave
[23:27:22] CPT Nathan Vance: /y There are several types of aliens, some of them named, some of them not.
[23:27:23] PFC Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: .// crungle
[23:27:45] CPT Nathan Vance: /y The most common you will find are parasitics. Colloquially called headcrabs, they will jump onto your head and control your body.
[23:28:00] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They are small, but do not overestimate them. They can turn a good day bad quickly.
[23:28:07] CPT Nathan Vance: .//underestimate
[23:28:08] CPT Nathan Vance: .//fuck
[23:28:14] CPT Nathan Vance: .//i need sleep

[23:28:37] CPT Nathan Vance: .//i just don't sleep

[23:28:49] CCA.C17-QrM.52934: .// you want two necrotics? got it
[23:28:50] Keith Schmidt: [[ we believe you
[23:29:04] Miles Anderson: /looc I have free necrotics
[23:29:07] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They are colloquially called zombies, and they have 4 types.
[23:29:25] CPT Nathan Vance: /y First type is your standard necrotic. Moves slow, hits hard.
[23:29:39] CPT Nathan Vance: /y Sometimes they like to hit things towards you, that hurts about as much.
[23:29:41] CPT Nathan Vance: /y 
[23:29:52] CPT Nathan Vance: /y Next up is the fast variant.
[23:30:05] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They are skinnier, they can leap, and they leap in the air.
[23:30:05] Keith Schmidt: [[ god if only I had this training before I ever played Half Life
[23:30:09] CPT Nathan Vance: .//lmao
[23:30:26] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They hit fast, and they have been known to climb.
[23:30:39] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They're not particularly intelligent, but they're agile, and it makes them a decent threat.
[23:30:42] CCA.C17-QrM.52934: // brb grabbing a drink
[23:30:46] CPT Nathan Vance: /y Next up is the poisonous variety.
[23:31:04] CPT Nathan Vance: /y You'll recognize them because of their freakishly engorged body parts.
[23:31:36] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They'll normally have blood stains, physical distortions, they're easily the most jacked up bodily.
[23:31:46] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They hit very hard, and they can tank gunshots.
[23:32:14] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They normally act as hosts to more black parasitics. They will throw the parasitics on you to attack you.
[23:32:28] CPT Nathan Vance: /y The parasitics are the real threat. If they miss your head, they'll inject venom into you.
[23:32:34] CPT Nathan Vance: /y This venom is highly potent, and is very good at killing.
[23:32:54] CPT Nathan Vance: /y Next up is the scariest variant.
[23:33:00] CPT Nathan Vance: /y I've had the displeasure of seeing nine or so in my career.
[23:33:09] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They don't have a name, but you'll know them when you see them.
[23:33:34] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They're a regular necrotic, but bigger and stronger. They look like eighties wrestlers in size, no I am not exaggerating.
[23:33:52] CPT Nathan Vance: /y Their parasitic will seem to be getting thinner, as if it's becoming a part of the organism.
[23:34:13] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They charge, they hit hard, and they will reach into their guts to throw a toxic piece of gunk at you.
[23:34:21] CPT Nathan Vance: /y Taking one alone is a one way ticket to hell.
[23:34:32] CPT Nathan Vance: /y Next up are tripods, coloquially called peeper puppies!
[23:34:44] CPT Nathan Vance: /y Or, sometimes houndeyes.
[23:34:47] CCA.C17-QrM.52934: // PEEPER PUPPIES
[23:34:54] CPT Nathan Vance: .//look, gordon! an HLVRAI reference!
[23:35:07] CCA.C17-QrM.52934: .// HL2RPVRAI
[23:35:19] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They are pack animals, easily recognizable because of their three legs and several eyes.
[23:35:36] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They attack by releasing a shockwave that causes physical damage to targets in its vicinity.
[23:36:06] CPT Nathan Vance: /y While not terribly dangerous on their own, they are usually found in packs, and thus are much more dangerous as they seem.
[23:36:17] CPT Nathan Vance: /y Next up are concussors, also called squeaks!
[23:36:50] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They are small insectoids about the size of an orange with one big, green eye. They run towards you, jump up and bite you, and eventually explode.
[23:37:18] CPT Nathan Vance: /y Again, like most other aliens, they are not dangerous on their own, but in large groups, they can easily take out at least two men.
[23:37:33] CPT Nathan Vance: /y Then, antlions.
[23:37:58] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They have no official name at the moment, but they are the most dangerous xenobe you will ever find.
[23:38:11] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They populate shell beach, and they can only be killed by sinking ammunition into them.
[23:38:16] CPT Nathan Vance: /y I do in fact mean sinking.
[23:38:46] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They do a lot of damage, and are about 3 quarters as tall as you.
[23:38:52] CPT Nathan Vance: /y One can take out two overwatch soldiers.
[23:39:11] CPT Nathan Vance: /y You do not mess with antlions unless the union's safety depends on it!
[23:39:26] Keith Schmidt: /me nods.
[23:40:17] (tsay from CPT Nathan Vance) 2018, i think around june. Some secret outpost.
[23:40:25] CPT Nathan Vance: /me looks confused.
[23:40:34] CPT Nathan Vance: Did you hear that?
[23:40:40] Keith Schmidt: Uh...Yes, sir.
[23:41:00] Miles Anderson: /me takes a look around.

[23:41:48] Keith Schmidt: [[ Did we just receive a glimpse into the future...?
[23:41:50] Miles Anderson: well except for the hula girls.
[23:41:55] CPT Nathan Vance: If we're alone, that makes it worse.
[23:42:16] CPT Nathan Vance: /r Uhh, during training, myself and three other conscripts heard some voice, talking about the year 2018 and a secret outpost.
[23:42:25] CPT Nathan Vance: /r Nobody else in the room to our knowledge.
[23:42:33] CPT Nathan Vance: ...Alright...
[23:42:38] CPT Nathan Vance: /y Moving on!
[23:42:58] Keith Schmidt: /me nods, looking slightly confused.
[23:43:02] CPT Nathan Vance: /y Alien toads, also called chumtoads.
[23:43:34] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They're strange toad creatures with bright coloration.
[23:43:46] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They're dumb as a box of rocks and pose no harm to anyone.
[23:44:00] CPT Nathan Vance: /y You can kill them if you want, or don't. It doesn't matter.
[23:44:03] CCA.C17-QrM.52934 to admins: what if pet chumtoad for the conscripts
[23:44:10] Adachi Tetsuo: Are they edible?
[23:44:29] CPT Nathan Vance: Find out and let me know.
[23:44:35] CPT Nathan Vance: /y Last, bullsquids.
[23:44:37] Adachi Tetsuo: Yes, sir!
[23:44:41] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They have no official name, but they're pretty dangerous
[23:44:55] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They're also called bullchickens.
[23:45:29] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They're two-legged aliens with a big red set of lips or tendrils.
[23:45:35] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They've also got a tail.
[23:45:46] Adachi Tetsuo: /looc please never call them lips again
[23:45:48] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They spit at you. While not poisonous, it is corrosive to human skin.
[23:45:59] CPT Nathan Vance: .//i'll call them labia instead since that's latin for lips
[23:46:09] Adachi Tetsuo: /looc at least i can pretend its not
[23:46:10] Keith Schmidt: [[ wonderful
[23:46:44] CPT Nathan Vance: /y If you get close, they'll spin around and whip you with their tail.
[23:46:49] CPT Nathan Vance: /y Any questions?
[23:46:55] Keith Schmidt: /me shakes his head.
[23:47:06] Miles Anderson: No, sir.
[23:47:09] CPT Nathan Vance: /y If you see any antlions within the city, radio it in immediately.
[23:47:10] Adachi Tetsuo: No, sir!
[23:47:36] CPT Nathan Vance: /y One last thing, but it's non motile so it's a different creature.
[23:47:38] CPT Nathan Vance: /y Barnacles!
[23:47:58] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They are ceiling-clinging organisms that have a long yellow tongue that hangs down and catches prey.
[23:48:08] CPT Nathan Vance: /y They wrap their tongue around your neck and choke you while they pull you up to eat you.
[23:48:15] CPT Nathan Vance: /y If you're not careful, they can ruin your day.
[23:48:20] CPT Nathan Vance: /y Or life.
[23:48:41] CPT Nathan Vance: /y Also, be careful for large, carnivorous, alien fish.
[23:48:57] CPT Nathan Vance: /y Stay out of the water and you'll be alright.
[23:49:18] CPT Nathan Vance: /y As a conscript, you will be held to a high standard of loyalty and duty.
[23:49:32] CPT Nathan Vance: /y You are serving the best thing to ever happen to humanity, and you damn well better actl ike it!
[23:50:00] Miles Anderson: /y Yes, sir!
[23:50:05] Keith Schmidt: /me nods. "Sir, yes sir!"
[23:50:08] Adachi Tetsuo: /y Yes, sir!
[23:50:11] CPT Nathan Vance: /y You will not be given direct police work. You are not police, you are not citizens.
[23:50:14] CPT Nathan Vance: /y You are soldiers and guards.
[23:50:32] CPT Nathan Vance: /y You will likely be stationed either in the city to guard the nexus or various other Combine managed locations, or to the beach.
[23:50:37] CPT Nathan Vance: /y We have an outpost there that needs maintenance.
[23:50:50] CPT Nathan Vance: /y You do not give Civil Protection units orders.
[23:51:09] CPT Nathan Vance: /y Despite having more combat importance, relatively speaking, you do not give them orders.
[23:51:29] CPT Nathan Vance: /y The food chain, going upwards, is Conscripts, Civil Protection, Overwatch.
[23:51:46] CPT Nathan Vance: /y You may walk alongside overwatch. They have authority over you, without question.
[23:51:50] CPT Nathan Vance: /y Do you have any questions?
[23:51:58] Miles Anderson: No, sir.
[23:52:00] Keith Schmidt: /me shakes his head.
[23:52:06] Adachi Tetsuo: No, sir.
[23:52:41] CPT Nathan Vance: /y You may be authorized break time to go to citizen locations. When this happens, you will give in your weapons and valuable equipment.
[23:52:52] CPT Nathan Vance: /y You will be in uniform, but not armored.
[23:53:32] CPT Nathan Vance: /y Now, let me make sure you all are in good physical shape!
[23:53:38] CPT Nathan Vance: /y Do you know what counted squats are??
[23:53:47] Miles Anderson: Yes, sir.
[23:54:00] CPT Nathan Vance: /y You will give me thirty-five when I give the word!
