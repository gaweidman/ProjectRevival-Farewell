[00:28:42] PVT Adachi Tetsuo: /me unslings his MP7, popping a magazine in while figuring out how to operate the gun.
[00:28:49] PVT Adachi Tetsuo: You'd think they'd give us live fire training.
[00:29:06] PVT Adachi Tetsuo: /me raised his gun, with a sloppy stance. He attempted to line up a shot.
[00:29:12] PVT Miles Anderson: guys we're gonna have to be self taught
[00:29:20] PVT Adachi Tetsuo: /me was surprised at the low recoil.
[00:29:26] PVT Adachi Tetsuo: This isn't horrible..

[00:29:51] PVT Miles Anderson: hey thats not too bad
[00:29:54] PVT Adachi Tetsuo: /me presses the button, pushing the target down range.
[00:30:06] PVT Adachi Tetsuo: Time for some sharpshooting.
[00:30:15] PVT Adachi Tetsuo: I'm used to small arms, but nothing above a pistol.
[00:30:33] PVT Adachi Tetsuo: /me took about fifteen seconds, before holding his breath and squeezing the trigger on the targets head.
[00:30:44] PVT Miles Anderson: well i'd say your doing pretty well

[00:31:09] PVT Miles Anderson: hmm...
[00:31:14] PVT Adachi Tetsuo: Might want to pull the target in a bit first.
[00:31:17] PVT Adachi Tetsuo: Just to get your bearings.

[00:32:36] CCA.C17-QrM.52934: /toggleraise
[00:32:48] PVT Miles Anderson: what?

[00:36:36] PVT Adachi Tetsuo: You need to have a talk with the fucking administrator, this is a rocky situation.

[22:03:37] Andrew Philip: because of that overwatch found this place
[22:03:52] Andrew Philip: they looked in another area which gave people enough time
[22:04:13] Vincint Abernathy: what do you mean overwatch found this place, and whats that story have to do with you being down here.
[22:06:38] Andrew Philip: Overwatch Soldiers cleaned every conner in the sewers before finding it - for me after finding this outpost I though I'd be able to help people resist or seek refugee down here, but this place isn't fully complete yet. 
[22:08:21] Vincint Abernathy: you said this is supposed to be refugee camp, that mean there are other people here because to me this just looks like a sad hideout complete or not.
[22:09:00] Andrew Philip: -supposed to be- for now it is a hideout until I get an escape tunnel made
[22:09:21] Andrew Philip: and yes
[22:09:23] Andrew Philip: there is other people
[22:09:28] Vincint Abernathy: for now i'll trust you since you have the cat statue.

[22:11:36] Vincint Abernathy: may I ask a final question?
[22:11:39] Andrew Philip: go on
[22:12:10] Vincint Abernathy: since this is a refugee camp does that mean its open to anyone and if so may I stash some items here.
[22:12:25] Andrew Philip: mhm
