[16:03:14] Andrew Philip: that was my idea
[16:03:18] Andrew Philip: there was 3 other people

[16:08:18] Andrew Philip: and not too safe for my liking
[16:08:42] Andrew Philip: I am sorry if I didn't get to know you better, I wanna talk more to be honest
[16:08:42] Marcus Wilson: I'm sure there are other hideouts here.
[16:08:56] Marcus Wilson: Probably abandoned, but recyclable.
[16:09:10] Marcus Wilson: Might be a good idea to look for concealed entrances.
[16:09:14] Andrew Philip: For context another group was here before us
