[16:07:03] Marcus Wilson: Meh.
[16:07:14] Marcus Wilson: Its exciting. And it helps us. I don't mind fighting.
[16:07:20] Andrew Philip: /me stops him
[16:07:31] Andrew Philip: /me looks at him rather with a serious tone
[16:07:40] Marcus Wilson: What is it man?
[16:07:42] Andrew Philip: I know - but please I don't want to lose more people
[16:08:03] Marcus Wilson: /me lowers his tone a bit, getting serious. "Alright. I'll be careful. I promise."
[16:08:04] Andrew Philip: /me lets go, sighing
[16:09:45] Andrew Philip: damn, we are almost out of bandages
[16:09:58] Marcus Wilson: /me hangs his tools off of his breathing apparatus, as well as his pipe wrench.
[16:10:20] Marcus Wilson: Rey, you talked about wanting to uh.. talk, right?
[16:11:24] Andrew Philip: /me as he puts more drinks on the table for more people to drink, he turns around and says "Huh? did I?"
[16:11:36] Marcus Wilson: Yeah. You know, like get to know eachother better.
[16:11:53] Andrew Philip: I don't remember a darn thing from the last day - oh yeah yeah, probably I did say something like that
[16:12:10] Andrew Philip: tell me about yourself Marcus, where you come from and stuff
[16:12:38] Marcus Wilson: /me takes a seat, "Well I'm from Appalachia. More specifically a shithole in Appalachia where people dwell with no future."
[16:12:48] Marcus Wilson: /looc is there a crouch lock thing 
[16:12:54] Marcus Wilson: /looc i know some servers have it
[16:12:57] Andrew Philip: // Alt+Shift 
[16:13:01] Marcus Wilson: /looc thx
[16:13:16] Andrew Philip: Appalachia? First time hearing about it actually.
[16:13:40] Marcus Wilson: Its a region in the US. Most people call us hicks, but that doesn't paint the full picture.
[16:14:07] Andrew Philip: /me chuckles " Oh the old world "
[16:14:15] Marcus Wilson: In Appalachia people were racist, homophobic, whatever. But they were just ignorant. There was a lot of love there.
[16:15:06] Marcus Wilson: You know its real odd hearing your parents be racist, and just say horrible things. But their actions tell a different story, you can tell they're good people.
[16:15:12] Marcus Wilson: That's what Appalachia is like.
[16:15:38] Marcus Wilson: People that grow up there usually just join the horrible cycle of racism and shit, but me and my sister broke out of it.
[16:16:01] Marcus Wilson: Got a strong sense of empathy from Appalachia- and a warrior spirit too.
[16:16:18] Marcus Wilson: Whole family had it. We were fighters, and we stuck it out till the end fighting for eachother.
[16:16:39] Marcus Wilson: /me spoke shakily with this next sentence, "Then the Combine came."
[16:17:07] Marcus Wilson: You put a lot of stubborn warrior bastards together that're willing to die for eachother.. Then you get a slaughter.
[16:17:30] Marcus Wilson: /me sat in silence for a moment before looking up. "Sorry to get a bit depressing at the end there. How about you?"

[16:28:08] Andrew Philip: /looc I was gonna cut you
[16:28:30] Andrew Philip: Whaow Marcus - you got real personnel with me
[16:29:25] Marcus Wilson: Maybe I'm a bit too trusting. I don't know, if we're sticking it out against all odds down here might as well spill my guts now.
[16:30:04] Andrew Philip: true, but  their fancy walls can’t protect them anymore, and soon, they aren’t going to kill any more of our loved ones. 
[16:30:26] Andrew Philip: we just have to focus, and have faith and hope
[16:30:55] Andrew Philip: but still - you can't be too trusting down here, to be honest I think Vinicent is insane worshiping a cat as a dog
[16:30:57] Andrew Philip: /me chuckles
[16:31:31] Marcus Wilson: /me chuckles, "You have to be a little crazy to survive down here, don't ya?"
[16:31:32] Andrew Philip: /looc dog->god
[16:31:36] Andrew Philip: /looc dumbass keyboard
[16:31:43] Andrew Philip: /me shakes his head in a no
[16:32:09] Andrew Philip: I don't have to stay here - I've already got comfortable establishments on the surface
[16:32:51] Andrew Philip: but here's the reason why I am here - I lived in the best loyalist city "City 24" the air was the same as the one before the war, fresh. pure... 
[16:33:07] Andrew Philip: the reason was everyone was a loyalist, they didn't know a damn thing about the outside world
[16:33:09] Client "Frazzy" connected.
[16:33:29] Andrew Philip: they tried to gas us with toxics that would hide the truth as they slowly drive us to extinction
[16:33:41] Andrew Philip: A riot broke out
[16:33:47] Andrew Philip: I failed a mission and ended up here
[16:33:50] Marcus Wilson: /me silently dragged a bag of chips over to him, popping them open and sliding a few at a time into his mouth under his mask.
[16:36:17] Andrew Philip: and now I know who's the ture enemy, I am here to spark hope in people's heart, and to not forget the people I lost and hold dear, revenge and get this planet back... it may not happen in the next week, or any time soon, but me and someone blew a hole and 
[16:36:25] Andrew Philip: went into the nexus, I have an idea of what the inside look like 
[16:36:40] Andrew Philip: we just have to gain resources, and wait, and if anyone gets captured we'd save them.
[16:36:49] Andrew Philip: maybe do more seriouse damage
[16:36:53] Andrew Philip: /looc serious*
[16:36:58] Andrew Philip: but all that have to wait
[16:37:26] Andrew Philip: Civil Protection officers right now are just people trying to get benfits - expect the ones who took memeory replacements
[16:37:36] Andrew Philip: and I need to know who killed one of my comrades

[16:37:51] Andrew Philip: that's why I am here
[16:38:09] Marcus Wilson: Sounds ambitious. The kind of cause I can rally behind.
[16:38:23] Marcus Wilson: I don't need faith or hope, you know.
[16:38:37] Marcus Wilson: All I need is another crazy bastard willing to have my back until the end.
[16:39:17] Andrew Philip: /me chuckles " Yeah, I'll tell you a plan but we have to get a secret tunnel done "
[16:39:26] Andrew Philip: one CP killed or mugged, and they will scatter all of their forces down here
[16:39:29] Andrew Philip: and this place wont be safe.
[16:39:59] Marcus Wilson: So, killing a few CP bastards is off the table until we build that tunnel. I get you.
[16:40:12] Frazzy<STEAM_0:0:457261159> changed their name to Vincint Abernathy
[16:41:05] Andrew Philip: remember marcus, some CPs are still people behind the mask, we just have to single them out - this city have seen all type of Rebels, Cultists, Terriosts & Bandits.
[16:41:56] Marcus Wilson: While I'm indifferent to what CP I bash to death with a wrench, I get what you mean.
[16:42:03] Marcus Wilson: We need info on their internal ranking structure
[16:42:16] Marcus Wilson: We need an insider- Maybe not a CP, but a loyalist could get info.
[16:42:30] Marcus Wilson: Even basic ranking structure could get us a lot of info on who to kill.
[16:42:40] Marcus Wilson: /me jumps, "Fuck!"
[16:42:45] Andrew Philip: for now, they're all the same, I have no reason to doubt it -

[16:45:26] Vincint Abernathy: Sorry but i'll have to decline, I don't really hold my drinks well.

[16:46:53] Vincint Abernathy: /me takes a small sip of his drink.
[16:47:06] Vincint Abernathy: where'd you find that?
[16:47:17] Marcus Wilson: Some zombie had it on his wrist.

[17:15:38] Andrew Philip: that's what I wanna do.... 
[17:15:43] Andrew Philip: the other rooms will act as storage
[17:15:44] Marcus Wilson: It gives refugees a place to sleep and some privacy.
[17:15:51] Andrew Philip: true true
[17:16:06] Marcus Wilson: I feel so stagnant. Like we're not making any progress.

[17:16:17] Marcus Wilson: We should do that.
[17:16:31] Andrew Philip: I can provide them... soon
[17:16:36] Vincint Abernathy: sleeping on the ground has been killing my back.
[17:16:38] Marcus Wilson: We could probably find them in the trash, and then wash them off with water from shell beach.
[17:16:46] Andrew Philip: I know a CWU who sells forunature all the time, fresh and clean
[17:16:52] Marcus Wilson: Well shit.

[17:19:56] Vincint Abernathy: Yes?

[17:21:10] Andrew Philip: and I have couple questions actually
[17:21:21] Vincint Abernathy: ask away my friend.
[17:21:58] Andrew Philip: would you discriminate someone else for worshipping another god?
[17:22:46] Andrew Philip: /me punchs marcus on the arm
[17:22:52] Vincint Abernathy: how could I discriminate someone for worshiping something else, as long as their ignorance doesn't effect me it's fine

[17:25:17] Vincint Abernathy: I suppose your right about that.
[17:25:44] Vincint Abernathy: i'm going to head back to the surface for a bit.
[17:25:54] Vincint Abernathy: you two try not to die.
[17:26:04] Andrew Philip: you two should go up top, I'll be behind

[17:28:42] Marcus Wilson: You're a master of deadpan comedy.
[17:28:50] Marcus Wilson: Anyway, time to get out of here.

[19:59:54] Andrew Philip: you need about 10-20 bottles to feel the alchoal affect
[20:00:28] Andrew Philip: I doubt any citizen would carry 300 tokens just for UU Alchoal
[20:00:48] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.01477: I get a salary, so I can buy whatever alcohol I want.
[20:00:56] Andrew Philip: even pre-war?
[20:01:07] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.01477: With the right amount of cash, probably.
[20:01:19] Andrew Philip: its not a contraband? 
[20:01:30] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.01477: To you, maybe.
[20:01:41] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.01477: I do not hold all the answers.
[20:01:49] Andrew Philip: true true
[20:01:59] Sophie Clermont: I'm sure they let the civil protection indulge a bit for their hard work, yes?
[20:02:22] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.01477: I have not seen such, but I know once in a while we can gather around and eat in the break room.
[20:02:41] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.01477: Some people think we're robots, I would too.
[20:03:06] Andrew Philip: nah - I don't think so
[20:03:19] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.01477: You always have or did you just change your mind?
[20:03:23] Andrew Philip: whenever people say that I mention there is a person behind the mask
[20:03:35] Andrew Philip: always have officer.
[20:04:06] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.01477: Good - It's a shame I can't be treated by such as C-M-U, as in some cases I need to take my mask off.
[20:05:57] Andrew Philip: I doubt it, one time I had to patch up one of your officers but the other one  that was just here - I recongize him becasue he is wearing the same uniform since last time
[20:06:11] Andrew Philip: was standing with his gun raised, and he didn't allow me to take off the unit's mask
[20:06:15] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.01477: Don't say you recognize an officer.
[20:06:28] Andrew Philip: I don't recongize him, just the uniform
[20:06:51] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.01477: Yes, but you still are inferring you recognize 'em.. I don't care, personally, just don't mention it like that to another officer.
[20:07:02] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.01477: That is a one-way trip, friend.

[20:08:54] Andrew Philip: I heard of him, he put down notes trying to sell contraband, right?
[20:09:01] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.01477: I know nothing of that.

[20:09:13] Marcus Wilson: Surprised you haven't got him yet.
