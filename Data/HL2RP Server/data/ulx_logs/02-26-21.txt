[21:17:04] Unknown: Indeed you have.
[21:17:05] Unknown: /me grins.
[21:17:23] Unknown: Mister King, it is to my understanding that you have quite the proficiency for... espionage.
[21:17:54] Unknown: I will admit, I have a vested interest in your success.
[21:18:39] Unknown: So much so that I am willing to work out an agreement with you for assisting me.
[21:19:22] Unknown: Your talents make you an especially desirable candidate for express travel to the island you seek.
[21:19:49] Unknown: Should you agree, I will place you there under the guise of a secretary to an administrator.
[21:20:02] Dustin Rory: And if I refuse?
[21:20:13] Unknown: I find it very difficult to believe you will refuse.
[21:20:30] Unknown: You will make preparations for your.. friends.
[21:20:58] Unknown: In exchange, I can give you a chance at most anything you could dream of.
[21:21:07] Unknown: What would you want in exchange, mister King?
[21:21:50] Dustin Rory: /me Seems rather stunned at the phrase "at most anything you could dream of" but would regain his calm and begin speaking.
[21:23:15] Dustin Rory: I want to create a true resistance, in exchange for my help I want you to give me the power to create a true rebellion that have the chance at destroying the Combine, I doubt you could just destroy the Combine so I will attempt to with what you can give me
[21:23:29] Unknown: Ah.
[21:23:29] Dustin Rory: Every other rebellion so far has no chance.
[21:23:36] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: // :(
[21:23:39] Unknown: Mister King, you presume too much.
[21:23:48] Unknown: I am capable of a great many things.
[21:24:16] Unknown: However, I operate under certain... limitations, shall you say.
[21:24:29] Unknown: /doorsethidden false
[21:24:43] Dustin Rory: So, are you trying to say that the Combine or "universal union" have been allowed to exist due to these limitations?
[21:25:09] Unknown: You are rather inquisitive.
[21:25:11] Dustin Rory: I doubt something like it is "good for business" going off of what you're doing right now.
[21:25:31] Unknown: I believe we are getting off track, mister King.
[21:25:36] Dustin Rory: Fair enough
[21:25:55] Unknown: I may help you. The extent to which I may promise you a... rebel group.. as you say, is limited.
[21:26:17] Dustin Rory: I ask you this, can I redeem myself for what i've done?
[21:26:25] Dustin Rory: Final question of course.
[21:26:41] Unknown: Mister King, I am not a philosopher.
[21:27:47] Dustin Rory: Hmph, then fine, I accept your terms under the reward of a "rebel group capable of defeating the Combine" I just want to truly redeem myself.
[21:28:08] Unknown: /me makes a noise, as if thinking.
[21:28:15] Unknown: You carry a great deal of guilt.
[21:28:29] Dustin Rory: /me Gives a bitter chuckle.
[21:28:31] Unknown: I may be able to assist.. to some extent.
[21:28:44] Unknown: What is your biggest regret, Mister King?
[21:29:09] Dustin Rory: Not taking advantage of what I once had, a true rebel group filled with believers.
[21:29:19] Unknown: hm
[21:29:25] Dustin Rory: Not logical men but passionate men capable of doing anything if they tried hard enough.
[21:29:37] Unknown: You miss the watchers.
[21:29:47] Dustin Rory: I-I do...
[21:30:26] Unknown: Perhaps I could.. gently push circumstances out of the way.
[21:30:41] Dustin Rory: Please explain.
[21:30:51] Unknown: I can reconnect you with the watchers.
[21:31:12] Dustin Rory: But....the Watchers are dead.
[21:31:21] Dustin Rory: John told me.
[21:31:26] Dustin Rory: They were wiped out.

[21:32:11] Unknown: Certain parts of the Combine's reign had ceased to exist until recently.
[21:32:21] Unknown: Things... change.
[21:32:38] Dustin Rory: You'll....change things until the Watchers are alive is what you're saying?
[21:33:35] Unknown: I will reunite you with the watchers.

[22:35:44] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.44618: I think we're definitely getting fired for this
[22:35:45] Tal'Rukan: /y My kin and I are living batteries of information, and we know all the changes the Combine has made
[22:35:47] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: you're telling me your a calender?
[22:35:49] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.71207: Not really no, but I don't speak with vorts. I have standards

[22:36:24] Tal'Rukan: That is not... how my abilities work.
[22:36:24] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.71207: I heard they were the reason for all of this, came to this planet instead of another one
[22:36:24] Michael J. Samson: that Vort shit is too weird for me
[22:36:28] Morgan Beck: Right.
[22:36:30] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: Was worth a shot
[22:36:32] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.44618: Mhm
[22:36:38] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.71207: so?
[22:36:44] Morgan Beck: There's still a grenade on one of the corpses if any of you want it.
[22:36:47] Tal'Rukan: /y We know of your quest to free reality from the iron fist of the Combine.
[22:36:48] Dustin Rory: I can tell you what happened John, but we need to get through this.
[22:36:56] Michael J. Samson: his name, Tal'Rukan, for some reason it sounds familiar to me
[22:37:11] Dustin Rory: .// no
[22:37:13] Daryl Drayton: /me strokes his beard intently listening to the Vortigaunt.
[22:37:17] Tal'Rukan: /y We wish to help. There is one change that affects everything.
[22:37:19] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.71207: definitely
[22:37:29] Tal'Rukan: /y That is, the death of the Freeman.
[22:37:33] Morgan Beck: Huh.
[22:37:38] Dustin Rory: Yeah, he was the liberator.
[22:37:41] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.71207: who the fuck is "Freeman"
[22:37:41] Michael J. Samson: i swear i've met him before, I just don't remember it
[22:37:43] Morgan Beck: Freeman? Sounds like a nobody.
[22:37:45] Dustin Rory: Before the Combine figured they could kill him, right?
[22:37:47] Tal'Rukan: /y You have been taught well.
[22:37:48] Nikolai Chekov: /me lightly kicks the corpse lying next to him now and then, listening.
[22:37:51] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.44618: Freeman
[22:37:53] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.44618: huh
[22:37:59] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.71207: Morgan Freeman?
[22:38:00] Tal'Rukan: /y They have traveled back in time and killed him during the black mesa incident.
[22:38:05] Morgan Beck: Oh shit.
[22:38:09] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.44618: Haha
[22:38:11] Morgan Beck: I'm uh, gonna head in to listen
[22:38:12] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.44618: I remember him
[22:38:15] Tal'Rukan: /y And as such, have doomed us all from liberation.
[22:38:19] Daryl Drayton: /me raises his eyebrows.
[22:38:19] Tal'Rukan: /y You, however, may change that.
[22:38:49] Tal'Rukan: /y This island, the very machine you see at its center, is part of one of the most elaborate devices in the history of the Combine's creation.
[22:39:04] Tal'Rukan: /y With thanks, of course, given to Aperture.
[22:39:12] Morgan Beck: I'm all good. Thanks though
[22:39:23] Tal'Rukan: /y If you wish to save the Freeman, you must travel back to Black Mesa.
[22:39:31] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.44618: /me sighs
[22:39:33] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.44618: great more walking
[22:39:35] Tal'Rukan: /y And destroy the Combine's forces before they can kill the freeman.
[22:39:41] Morgan Beck: I... don't think we'll walk there.
[22:39:44] Dustin Rory: Got it
[22:39:47] Tal'Rukan: /y mind opaque
[22:39:49] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: Send me out there, if you're going to send anyone.
[22:39:49] Tal'Rukan: .//FUCK
[22:39:51] Tal'Rukan: /y mind is opaque
[22:39:51] Morgan Beck: We're... going back in time from what I heard.
[22:39:52] Michael J. Samson: we've gotta go back in time
[22:39:54] Tal'Rukan: /y opaque
[22:39:56] Morgan Beck: To... the BMI.
[22:40:00] Tal'Rukan: /y Yes
[22:40:03] Tal'Rukan: /y exactly
[22:40:04] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.44618: back in fucking time?
[22:40:07] Morgan Beck: Y-Yeah.
[22:40:09] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.44618: what is this some bad 80s movie?
[22:40:13] Michael J. Samson: I can hear Huey Lewi-
[22:40:16] Tal'Rukan: /y It is not.
[22:40:19] Tal'Rukan: /me doesn't resist being tied, searched or anything. They are completely compliant given that the situation does not escalate.
[22:40:20] Dustin Rory: UNION don't take this lightly.
[22:40:21] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.71207: at least you'll be able to quit that diet early
[22:40:22] Tal'Rukan: .//void
[22:40:27] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.44618: haha
[22:40:27] Morgan Beck: And here I thought today was going to be another boring day of selling general goods.
[22:40:30] Michael J. Samson: how dare you diss Back To The Future, that was a great film
[22:40:32] Nikolai Chekov: If it were a movie, we all would have plot armor.
[22:40:35] Dustin Rory: This is the biggest thing you've ever participated in.
[22:40:37] Tal'Rukan: /y Can we please focus?
[22:40:44] Dustin Rory: Yeah
[22:40:46] Tal'Rukan: /y This is not a matter to be taken lightly.
[22:40:49] Daryl Drayton: /me nods, listening intently.
[22:40:53] Morgan Beck: /me sighs quietly, his breathing growing slightly panicked.
[22:40:54] Tal'Rukan: /y In your hands, very shortly, you will hold all of history.
[22:41:10] Tal'Rukan: /y Humanity, and all species it has and hasn't met, depend on your actions today.
[22:41:24] Tal'Rukan: /y One wrong action may not just strengthen the Combine, but ruin the earth for any future inhabitants.
[22:41:28] Tal'Rukan: /y Black Mesa is a dangerous place.
[22:41:35] Daryl Drayton: Are you coming?
[22:41:44] Tal'Rukan: /y I will not. I have other business to attend to.
[22:41:48] Daryl Drayton: /me nods.
[22:41:52] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.44618: /w heh, I could go back in time and stop all that embarrasing shit happening to me
[22:41:52] Daryl Drayton: I wish you luck.
[22:41:56] Dustin Rory: Can I ask you one thing before we do this?
[22:41:58] Morgan Beck: /w Right, buisness that is more important than fucking over time itself.
[22:42:10] Dustin Rory: Are you aware of my past actions?
[22:42:19] Daryl Drayton: /me sighs.
[22:42:22] Tal'Rukan: /y The vortigaunt are not omniscient.
[22:42:23] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.71207: /w if you don't see me then I already did that
[22:42:31] Nikolai Chekov: /w Does this guy have an ego or something?
[22:42:36] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.44618: /w hm
[22:42:36] Tal'Rukan: /y We are wise beyond the universe, but we are not all-knowing.
[22:42:39] Daryl Drayton: Listen man, he's been in a pod for months.
[22:42:40] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: /w Probably.
[22:42:40] Dustin Rory: Good to know
[22:42:44] Nikolai Chekov: /w That'll do it.
[22:42:54] Daryl Drayton: So. Off to save Freeman.
[22:42:56] Dustin Rory: It was just to know civvie
[22:42:58] Dustin Rory: Yep
[22:43:03] Tal'Rukan: /y You must know, there are preparations to be made.
[22:43:08] Tal'Rukan: /y You have many units to fight through.
[22:43:11] Morgan Beck: /me soon began to feel the effects of being tired and sore to all hell. His adrenaline had worn off to a degree.
[22:43:19] Tal'Rukan: /y There is an experimental new unit, nicknamed the super soldier.
[22:43:21] Tal'Rukan: //thank you dispatch
[22:43:26] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.44618: // I am cooperating I swear
[22:43:30] Tal'Rukan: /y It is, effectively, a walking strider.
[22:43:36] Morgan Beck: /w Oh fuckkk...
[22:43:39] Tal'Rukan: /y Handle it poorly, and your vortal cords will be cut.
[22:43:39] Dustin Rory: .// A strider already walks.
[22:43:41] Tal'Rukan: /y That is, you will perish.
[22:43:44] Tal'Rukan: /y Decisively.
[22:43:53] Tal'Rukan: /y I will teach you the ways of combat against the super soldier.
[22:44:02] Daryl Drayton: /me nods.
[22:44:02] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.71207: /w you should try it on
[22:44:08] Tal'Rukan: /y It attacks in two main ways.
[22:44:11] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.44618: /w bet
[22:44:13] Tal'Rukan: /y One is its arm-mounted cannon.
[22:44:23] Michael J. Samson: /w y'know i can hear you two right?
[22:44:25] Tal'Rukan: /it It will charge up and lock on to a single point, typically wherever somebody is standing.
[22:44:29] Tal'Rukan: .//shit
[22:44:32] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.71207: /w yeah, I can hear you too shitizen
[22:44:33] Tal'Rukan: /y It will charge up and lock on to a single point, typically wherever somebody is standing.
[22:44:40] Michael J. Samson: /w fuck you
[22:44:44] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.71207: /w love you too
[22:44:50] Tal'Rukan: /y When this happens, you must flee from its aim. Any distance too close is instant death.
[22:45:07] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.44618: /w bet you 100 tokens this all goes to shit
[22:45:10] Daryl Drayton: Shh.
[22:45:12] Tal'Rukan: /y If you get too close, however, it will punch you.
[22:45:26] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.71207: /w go on, its gonna be amazing
[22:45:29] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.71207: /w walking strider
[22:45:30] Tal'Rukan: /y It is very strong, and will put you halfway to death.
[22:45:34] Tal'Rukan: /y Do you all understand?
[22:45:38] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.44618: mhm
[22:45:38] Nikolai Chekov: Mhm.
[22:45:39] Tal'Rukan: /y The super soldier is not to be taken lightly.
[22:45:40] Dustin Rory: Understood!
[22:45:40] Michael J. Samson: affirmative
[22:45:41] Daryl Drayton: /me nods. "Understood"
[22:45:42] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.71207: maybe
[22:45:43] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: yep
[22:45:48] Morgan Beck: Yeah
[22:45:49] Miles Anderson: yeah
[22:45:58] Tal'Rukan: /y Masked ones, might I speak with you in private?
[22:46:07] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.44618: uhhh
[22:46:07] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.71207: right
[22:46:10] Tal'Rukan: come
[22:46:20] Morgan Beck: Shit is so incredibly fucked.
[22:46:27] Dustin Rory: You have no idea
[22:46:33] Dustin Rory: Well you have some idea
[22:46:39] Tal'Rukan: I would like you all to know that I do not share the same sentiments as the Cave Johnson.
[22:46:39] Nikolai Chekov: I just want to fucking use this gun more.
[22:46:40] Morgan Beck: /me takes a look at the grenade he has, hoping it would help.
[22:46:44] Tal'Rukan: He has seen much.
[22:46:45] Dustin Rory: We're fucking around with the entire universe.
[22:46:46] Michael J. Samson: i am going to lose my shit before the end of the day
[22:46:56] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.44618: Yeah killed many too
[22:46:56] Tal'Rukan: He distrusts all who pledge their allegiance to the Combine.
[22:46:56] Tal'Rukan: /me would take out his combat knife and cut the individual's ties.
[22:47:03] Morgan Beck: The CP units are treating this like some sort of day in the park.
[22:47:04] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: .// thanks
[22:47:06] Dustin Rory: One small step and everything could be ten times worse.
[22:47:09] Tal'Rukan: //void lmao
[22:47:10] Michael J. Samson: in other words, im about to lose my mind
[22:47:12] Nikolai Chekov: Why wouldn't they?
[22:47:14] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.71207: /looc epic moment
[22:47:17] Tal'Rukan: I would like all to know that I do not share the same sentiment.
[22:47:20] Michael J. Samson: they're CPs
[22:47:23] Tal'Rukan: I do believe there is morality left in you three.
[22:47:28] Michael J. Samson: they've never seen anything like this
[22:47:30] Morgan Beck: Doesn't mean they can't understand what the hell is at stake.
[22:47:30] Dustin Rory: It's just for show.
[22:47:37] Dustin Rory: I know CP's, they are just people.
[22:47:41] Tal'Rukan: Still, I am aware fighting the Combine is something you are not comfortable with.
[22:47:41] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.71207: /me looks at the officers then back to the vort
[22:47:49] Daryl Drayton: Brainwashed people.
[22:47:49] Tal'Rukan: If I may, allow me to attempt to appease you.
[22:47:50] Michael J. Samson: they aren't augmented, like the OTA
[22:47:54] Nikolai Chekov: Not all are brainwashed.
[22:47:54] Dustin Rory: They're fucking terrified, just trained to not show emotion.
[22:47:56] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.44618: hm
[22:47:59] Morgan Beck: Right
[22:48:00] Tal'Rukan: The Cave Johnson's main reason to fight is, yes, to oppose the Combine.
[22:48:07] Tal'Rukan: But far more is at stake than that, I assure you.
[22:48:09] Nikolai Chekov: Hard to tell emotion from them anyway.
[22:48:11] Daryl Drayton: They listen to the Universal Union. They're brainwashed.
[22:48:13] Nikolai Chekov: Besides body language.
[22:48:15] Morgan Beck: Keep an eye out for grenades on the corpses of the OTA.
[22:48:19] Daryl Drayton: Fucking insane.
[22:48:19] Dustin Rory: Yep
[22:48:20] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: I got a grenade.
[22:48:28] Morgan Beck: I think we'll fucking need them to deal with the "super soldier".
[22:48:32] Michael J. Samson: hey, you got a spare I can borrow Morgan?
[22:48:33] Tal'Rukan: The Combine can be rather reckless with its technology.
[22:48:33] Dustin Rory: Any of you have spare clothing? this suit is annoying.
[22:48:35] Tal'Rukan: This is fact.
[22:48:42] Morgan Beck: There was one. Down the hallway.
[22:48:45] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.44618: Oh I love being reckless
[22:48:45] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: Stick wit' it, you look badass.
[22:48:51] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.71207: that's being badass
[22:48:51] Dustin Rory: Fine
[22:48:52] Nikolai Chekov: I'll trade my coat for the suit.
[22:48:53] Michael J. Samson: i'll wait till they're done
[22:48:55] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.44618: Its how I chipped my tooth in 3rd grade
[22:48:55] Morgan Beck: Got it.
[22:49:00] Miles Anderson: look like your a mafia boss.
[22:49:02] Tal'Rukan: And, by aiding these other humans, you are helping prevent a far different catastrophe.
[22:49:16] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: All of you, I will make this clear.
[22:49:18] Morgan Beck: I'm thankful that if we all survive, at least I won't be profiled as a affilate to this once it's all said on done.
[22:49:19] Tal'Rukan: Time travel is very dangerous.
[22:49:22] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.71207: I hate vorts like you, but I will listen this time
[22:49:25] Nikolai Chekov: Eh.
[22:49:31] Tal'Rukan: There is a chance to wipe out all existence with what the Combine wishes to do.
[22:49:37] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: If you get in my way, while I'm firing, I will not hesitate to keep firing - so please, if you would be so kind, move out my way if I'm doin' somethin'.
[22:49:42] Nikolai Chekov: When you got nothing going for you, you end up not caring about the consequences.
[22:49:45] Tal'Rukan: So think of it not as resisting the Combine, but saving yourselves, or saving the Combine's entire existence and this reality.
[22:49:48] Michael J. Samson: i'm gonna have 60000 bounties on my head before the day is done
[22:49:57] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.71207: /me shrugs

[22:50:02] Morgan Beck: You better not shoot the guys with the grenades.
[22:50:05] Dustin Rory: More like, the Universal Union would literally do anything to get to you.
[22:50:06] Tal'Rukan: I know you all are repulsed by me.
[22:50:10] Tal'Rukan: But I wish to be understanding.
[22:50:15] Dustin Rory: All of us are beyond anti-civvie right now.
[22:50:18] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: /me would raise his shotgun into the air with his right hand, as a sign of patriarchy, "Hoo-rah boys, Hoo-fuckin'-rah!
[22:50:19] Morgan Beck: So how many Anti-Citizen Ones are there gonna be by the end of the day?
[22:50:25] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: Let's end this, once and for all.
[22:50:27] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.44618: Nope, I'm quite fond of a space alien with 3 arms and 4 eyes. 
[22:50:27] Nikolai Chekov: Enough.
[22:50:44] Dustin Rory: It's good to see you're in high spirits Watcher.
[22:50:51] Tal'Rukan: That is all. Thank you all for the respect to listen to me.
[22:50:53] Tal'Rukan: Best of luck to you all.
[22:50:56] Dustin Rory: By the way, remind me to give you a Blowtorch back, I still owe you one.
[22:50:59] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.71207: I don't touch the green, I have standards
[22:50:59] Nikolai Chekov: When this is all over, I just want to go back to my little fucking cabin in Siberia.
[22:51:01] Nikolai Chekov: If I live.
[22:51:03] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: I haven't gotten my hands dirty since I bombed that fuckin' Air-Ex!
[22:51:05] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: Be quiet
[22:51:13] Morgan Beck: I remember hearing about the Watchers from CCA chatter in City 14. Or 13. Can't remember.

[22:51:26] Tal'Rukan: Are you all ready to fight?
[22:51:29] Michael J. Samson: real quick, can i go steal a nade from one of the combine
[22:51:29] Dustin Rory: Yeah
[22:51:31] Nikolai Chekov: Yup.
