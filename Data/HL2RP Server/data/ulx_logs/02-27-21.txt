[22:28:10] Daryl Drayton: Curious
[22:28:13] Cave Johnson: .//I love how you knew immediately
[22:28:17] Daryl Drayton: [[ lmfao
[22:28:19] Cave Johnson: Caroline? She's here?
[22:28:20] Aperture Sciencetist: /me smiles confidently.
[22:28:23] Cave Johnson: /me grins ear to ear.
[22:28:30] Cave Johnson: I have to meet her. It's been a long time.
[22:28:43] Miles Anderson: looks like a board room.
[22:28:49] Aperture Sciencetist: Yup. She's here alright. You'll get to meet her if you join us in the GLaDOS bootup.
[22:28:55] Miles Anderson: well I did.
[22:28:58] Miles Anderson: not anymore.
[22:29:17] Cave Johnson: Sure, sure!
[22:29:18] Aperture Sciencetist: I'm sure she'll be excited to meet her former boss after all these years.
[22:29:19] Cave Johnson: I'd be happy to.
[22:29:28] Cave Johnson: I'll bet she will, it's been.. what, three years?
[22:29:39] Cave Johnson: I barely even know when I died/
[22:29:46] Cave Johnson: By the way, are you guys serving brains in the break room?
[22:29:52] Aperture Sciencetist: Most likely. We've been busy since your passing, as we honored your memory of science.
[22:29:53] Daryl Drayton: /me clears his throat "Speaking of 3 years, Cave..."
[22:29:56] Thomas Farrer: Whoa.
[22:29:57] Daryl Drayton: /me smiles.
[22:30:05] Michael J. Samson: /me let's out a small chuckle
[22:30:10] Aperture Sciencetist: Hm, no idea. I don't suggest going after our interns though. They don't got the brains you seek.
[22:30:19] Miles Anderson: pretty cool, but seems kinda like a waste of space.
[22:30:20] Cave Johnson: Alright, you'll have to do. Executive order, hand me a scalpel.
[22:30:22] Cave Johnson: /me chuckles.
[22:30:23] Cave Johnson: I'm kidding.
[22:30:25] Cave Johnson: I'm not a zombie.
[22:30:33] Aperture Sciencetist: /me nods.
[22:30:34] Cave Johnson: Alright, who wants to explore the campus?
[22:30:43] Aperture Sciencetist to admins: Morgan time?

[22:32:03] Cave Johnson to admins: He's not crazy yet
[22:32:07] Daryl Drayton: Perhaps unfortunate for who find themselves waking up in there.
[22:32:10] Cave Johnson to admins: he's young, but he's not insane yet. i mean, he is, but, he's medicated
[22:32:21] Michael J. Samson: // look at the door to the vutton room

[22:49:44] Cave Johnson: /event Now, Mister Johnson, do you have an issue with this new leadership?
[22:49:50] Thomas Farrer: This is how we fuckin' die! To some stupid ass robot!

[22:51:07] Cave Johnson: /y We need to use the time machine, we're not supposed to be here!
[22:51:21] Michael J. Samson: // HOW, ITS IN 2006!
[22:51:26] Cave Johnson: //no it's not
[22:51:30] Cave Johnson: //may 8, 2003
[22:51:32] Morgan Beck: /me stares, trying to keep his calm.
[22:51:34] Cave Johnson: //combine hasn't come yet
[22:51:56] Michael J. Samson: how are we meant to get to the time machine?! It hasn't even been made yet!
[22:52:00] Thomas Farrer: /w Aye yo, why can't we just shut this bitch off?
[22:52:08] Morgan Beck: /me uses his loyalist armband to cover his mouth, in hopes of surviving longer just incase.
[22:52:10] Cave Johnson: The time machine was made in the nineteen eighties, Michael.
[22:52:35] Daryl Drayton: Where is it?! We gotta go before we choke, Cave.
[22:52:37] Cave Johnson: /y Something took over the Earth, a dictatorship, we had to stop them from messing up time, we're all stuck here now, it's really long and convoluted.
[22:52:39] Morgan Beck: Does anyone else have anything to cover their mouths with?
[22:52:44] Morgan Beck: If not, here.
[22:52:44] Cave Johnson: /y Please, just let us get to the time machine.
[22:53:05] Cave Johnson: /event I'm afraid I can't do that, Mister Johnson!
[22:53:10] Morgan Beck: T-That's all I can provide.
[22:53:11] Michael J. Samson: /me uses the shirt to cover up his mouth
[22:53:13] Cave Johnson: /event We've got *lots* of science to do.
[22:53:23] Cave Johnson: /y Science? TO HELL WITH THE SCIENCE, CAROLINE!
[22:53:24] Thomas Farrer: Uh- I've got a rag.
[22:53:28] Cave Johnson: /Y LOOK AT WHERE IT'S GOTTEN US!
[22:53:43] Cave Johnson: /Y WE'VE GOT A FASCIST REGIME CONTROLLING THE WORLD, YOU'RE TURNING THE WHOLE FACILITY INTO A GAS CHAMBER!
[22:53:46] Cave Johnson: /Y TO HELL WITH SCIENCE!
[22:53:50] Thomas Farrer: /me takes the old rag from his backpack. He wraps it around his mouth, using it almost as a bandana.
[22:53:53] Cave Johnson: /event Oh, I see what's going on.
[22:54:05] Cave Johnson: /event You're not Mister Johnson, is that right?
[22:54:09] Thomas Farrer: /w Isn't there a way to turn this bitch off?

[22:54:40] Morgan Beck: They're all going to fucking die.
[22:55:32] Cave Johnson: /event I'm sorry, Mister ""Johnson"". Due to Aperture Science emergency procedure Multiverse-7, you are likely to be a doppelganger or other form of evil clone.
[22:55:39] Michael J. Samson: // as an FYI, im currently trying to shut glados off in character, and failing miserably
[22:55:40] Morgan Beck: Multiverse...?
[22:55:43] Cave Johnson: //yes
[22:55:48] Michael J. Samson: /y FUCK!
[22:56:06] Cave Johnson: We had a lot of procedures, including multiverse caves coming in and trying to take over the facility.
[22:56:19] Michael J. Samson: /w didn't work
[22:56:20] Morgan Beck: Is... please tell me that's just a incase situation and not because there is a multiverse.
[22:56:22] Cave Johnson: This is supposed to prevent it.
[22:56:33] Cave Johnson: Oh, of course there's a multiverse.

[22:58:12] Morgan Beck: /me goes to slowly pull out his cigs.
[22:58:16] Cave Johnson: /event The rest of the facility, they're gone.

[22:58:44] Morgan Beck: In a fucking street.
[22:58:55] Cave Johnson: Light a cigarette and I will spend the last 2 minutes we have to live beating the hell out of you.
[22:59:12] Cave Johnson: /event That's the best I can do, Mister Johnson.

[23:01:37] Morgan Beck to admins: using a computer I found to type onto, see if there's a way to shut it down

[23:04:02] (tsay from Cave Johnson) What do you guys want to do? I really don't want this going past 2 events.

[23:45:46] Aperture Guard: /y You can step forward!
[23:45:49] Michael J. Samson: /me would lean against the bedframe and use his ridiculous tie to wrap around his knee
[23:45:49] Aperture Guard: Who?
[23:45:52] Aperture Guard: /me would take out his combat knife and cut the individual's ties.
[23:45:53] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: Some politician
[23:45:54] Aperture Guard: .//void
[23:46:14] Michael J. Samson: // q sucks with binds part 2, electric boogaloo
[23:46:21] Aperture Guard: Alright, uh.
[23:46:26] Aperture Guard: I don't like this situation any more than you do.
[23:46:32] Aperture Guard: Still, she's got eyes everywhere.
[23:46:37] Aperture Guard: So I've gotta do what she says.
[23:46:38] Morgan Beck: G-Great
[23:46:42] Morgan Beck: Is... Cave... okay?
[23:46:52] Aperture Guard: Cave... Johnson?
[23:46:54] Morgan Beck: Yes.
[23:46:57] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: yeah
[23:46:57] Morgan Beck: He was with us.
[23:46:59] Aperture Guard: No, he died.
[23:47:05] Morgan Beck: When?
[23:47:14] Aperture Guard: Ninety-eight.
[23:47:14] Morgan Beck: *When...?*
[23:47:18] Morgan Beck: /me sighs with relief
[23:47:20] Morgan Beck: Thank fuck.
[23:47:26] Aperture Guard: Excuse me?
[23:47:27] Michael J. Samson: /me would still be tying the tie around his knee, trying to stop any bleeding coming from any wound in his knee
[23:47:33] Morgan Beck: It's... complicated
[23:47:40] Morgan Beck: But you were lied to about his death
[23:47:46] Morgan Beck: I... can't bother to explain it right now.
[23:47:50] Morgan Beck: Head hurts too much as is.
[23:47:52] Aperture Guard: Well, in that case, I don't know.
[23:47:53] Michael J. Samson: o-ow...
[23:47:59] Aperture Guard: As far as I knew, he's long dead.
[23:48:05] Aperture Guard: You need medical attention, there?
[23:48:09] Michael J. Samson: i'm good
[23:48:19] Michael J. Samson: i've had worse believe it or not
[23:48:20] Morgan Beck: We all kinda do. We've been... fighting for a while.

[23:49:13] Morgan Beck: Look, it's fine.
[23:49:17] Joseph Bindle: They make me carry this, and I have it for my own safety.
[23:49:19] Michael J. Samson: maybe some painkillers
[23:49:29] Joseph Bindle: In case they do.. fight back.
[23:49:34] Joseph Bindle: What comes next isn't my fault.
[23:49:45] Michael J. Samson: fuck
[23:49:46] Morgan Beck: // rocks fall on us and we all die the end
[23:49:48] Michael J. Samson: were fucked
[23:49:57] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: why didn't we take his gun?
[23:50:03] Michael J. Samson: we are fucked 10 ways from fucking Saturday
[23:50:06] Morgan Beck: Look, he's just a guy.
[23:50:20] Morgan Beck: We already fucked with time enough as is
[23:50:26] Morgan Beck: Don't need to get another guy killed too early
[23:50:27] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307 to admins: what if i /kickdoor :flushed:

[23:50:40] Morgan Beck to admins: :(
[23:50:49] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307 to admins: but seriously
[23:51:00] Joseph Bindle to admins: you can try, but you fail
[23:51:06] Joseph Bindle: /y Me again.
[23:51:19] Joseph Bindle: /adminspawnmenu
[23:51:32] Joseph Bindle: Got you some of these.
[23:51:35] Joseph Bindle: Hope this'll do.
[23:51:40] Joseph Bindle: Not much for all of you.
[23:51:48] Joseph Bindle: //wait, who left
[23:51:52] Michael J. Samson: thanks, i'll spare em and use em wisely
[23:51:53] Morgan Beck: // Thomas

[23:51:57] Joseph Bindle: //oh
[23:52:14] Michael J. Samson: y'all need one?
[23:52:20] Morgan Beck: If it's a bandage, no.
[23:52:25] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: /w Next time he comes in, let's rush him. We don't have to kill him.
[23:52:32] Michael J. Samson: i've got 3 bandages
[23:52:36] Morgan Beck: I'm... I dunno.
[23:52:44] Morgan Beck: That might not be a good idea
[23:52:51] Morgan Beck: *She* has eyes everywhere
[23:52:55] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: There's no cameras in here
[23:52:57] Morgan Beck: Do we need to be neurotoxed?
[23:53:04] Morgan Beck: Are we *sure* of that though?
[23:53:07] Michael J. Samson: well, i'm glad they didn't take the copy of "The Black Cat" you gave me
[23:53:10] Joseph Bindle: Bad news.
[23:53:19] Joseph Bindle: One of you needs to go up as a test subject.
[23:53:23] Michael J. Samson: oh shit, how can it get any worse...
[23:53:27] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: test... subject?
[23:53:33] Morgan Beck: Anyone wanna go?
[23:53:33] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: test subject for what?
[23:53:39] Joseph Bindle: Take a guess
[23:53:43] Morgan Beck: Flip a coin?
[23:53:46] Morgan Beck: Volunteer?
[23:53:52] Joseph Bindle: Anyone volunteer?
[23:53:53] Joseph Bindle: Going once.
[23:53:54] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: fuck it, I'll go.
[23:53:56] Joseph Bindle: Going-
[23:53:57] Joseph Bindle: Alright.
[23:54:00] Joseph Bindle: Come with me.
[23:54:00] Michael J. Samson: rock paper scisso-
[23:54:02] Morgan Beck: God speed GRID.
[23:54:06] Morgan Beck: /y God speed!
[23:54:17] Joseph Bindle: Come with me, please.
[23:54:19] Michael J. Samson: so uh... whos going next?
[23:54:21] Morgan Beck: And then there were two.
[23:54:27] Morgan Beck: I... can go. 
[23:54:37] Joseph Bindle to admins: hmm
[23:54:38] Morgan Beck: You know more than me, so you're probably more important.
[23:54:38] Joseph Bindle to admins: fun idea
[23:54:42] Michael J. Samson: we're both pretty much equally injured
[23:54:45] Morgan Beck to admins: oh no
[23:54:51] Morgan Beck to admins: the twist is that we are the actual test subjects
[23:54:52] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307 to admins: oh no
[23:54:58] Morgan Beck: Yeah.
[23:55:00] Joseph Bindle to admins: holy shit that's genius
[23:55:02] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: what is that?
[23:55:03] Morgan Beck: But you know a shitton more than me.
[23:55:11] Joseph Bindle: /me doesn't respond. His eyes look pained.
[23:55:16] Michael J. Samson: true
[23:55:18] Morgan Beck to admins: uh oh.
[23:55:20] Joseph Bindle: Go ahead.
[23:55:29] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: not without you telling me what it is
[23:55:31] Michael J. Samson: i wonder what she did with Cave
[23:55:35] Morgan Beck: I'll tell you a secret of mine, since I'll probably die here.
[23:55:36] Joseph Bindle: /me 's eyes tear up.
[23:55:41] Joseph Bindle: //thanks dick
[23:55:48] Morgan Beck: I never cared for the Combine. CWU was a farce in terms of shit.
[23:55:51] Joseph Bindle: That's where you go.
[23:55:55] Morgan Beck: I just wanted to make money. Always my passion.
[23:56:05] Michael J. Samson: I fucking hate the Combine
[23:56:06] Morgan Beck: I wanted to get in contacts with rebels. That's a helluva jackpot.
[23:56:14] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: /me experiences flashbacks to the fucking cave johnson experiments
[23:56:17] Michael J. Samson: then you met me
[23:56:23] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: uh... 
[23:56:31] Morgan Beck: My dream was to either blackmarket goods, or let people stash their shit in my place, and a all lot more
[23:56:31] Joseph Bindle: I don't like it either, please.
[23:56:40] Morgan Beck: Hell, I would be willing to direct people on how to get out of the City.
[23:56:41] Joseph Bindle: I'm sorry.
[23:56:45] Morgan Beck: All for a price, of course.
[23:57:00] Morgan Beck: I'm a buisness man, first and foremost. And the Combine aren't profitable in the long run/
[23:57:07] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: /actsit
[23:57:13] Joseph Bindle<STEAM_0:1:53097688> changed their name to Adrienne Evans

[23:58:12] Michael J. Samson: City 24 is actually somewhat nice
[23:58:17] Morgan Beck: That's new.
[23:58:25] Aperture Scienceman: Hey.
[23:58:26] Michael J. Samson: it's in Hawaii, believe it or not
[23:58:30] Morgan Beck: Huh.
[23:58:32] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: .// is this anmation broke for you

[23:58:43] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: H-Hi
[23:58:45] Michael J. Samson: the one part of North America that didn't get shafted
[23:58:47] Aperture Scienceman: I'll need you to uh...
[23:58:57] Morgan Beck: Well, to be fair, Hawaii is a strange state.
[23:58:59] Aperture Scienceman: Face the wall.
[23:59:01] Morgan Beck: Well, "state"
[23:59:05] Morgan Beck: Practically its own place.
[23:59:07] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: which one?
[23:59:14] Aperture Scienceman: opposite the door.
[23:59:19] Michael J. Samson: yeah, basically
[23:59:37] Aperture Scienceman: Roll up your sleeve.
[23:59:42] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: what?
[23:59:45] Morgan Beck: You know, there was  numerous times I could've done the shady buisness I've always wanted to get myself into
[23:59:49] Aperture Scienceman: Your sleeve.
[23:59:54] Morgan Beck: But the smallest of things always got in my way.
[23:59:57] Michael J. Samson: like when you first met me?
