[18:05:13] Andrew Philip: I've managed to kill a few zombine too but I've only used their stuff to get my LP up
[18:05:32] Vincint Abernathy: well the less the better, at least in this case.
[18:05:42] Andrew Philip: one minute!

[18:06:05] Andrew Philip: /looc fencE*
[18:06:12] Vincint Abernathy: whats up?
[18:06:58] Andrew Philip: Stuff been rough lately, I haven't seen marcus or carson, and I am worried to invite people here from the surface
[18:07:27] Andrew Philip: I know 3 more people, 2 males named Todd and other one named Calvin and a Female named Sophie
[18:07:35] Andrew Philip: but they all answered to me as a possible loyalist.
[18:07:53] Vincint Abernathy: how long has it been since you've seen Marcus?
[18:11:25] Andrew Philip: 3 or 4 days almost
[18:11:37] Vincint Abernathy: thats not too bad.
[18:11:50] Andrew Philip: I lost count...
[18:11:53] Andrew Philip: maybe week or weeks...
[18:12:06] Vincint Abernathy: I haven't even been gone for weeks.
[18:12:15] Vincint Abernathy: I think your overreacting.
[18:12:38] Andrew Philip: I don't know man, get me a calnder then I'll be fine

[18:13:38] Vincint Abernathy: worst comes to worst we can just make tally marks on the wall
[18:14:58] Andrew Philip: I wish stuff were more simple now and days, but its been rough being alone down here.. you don't know how happy I am seeing you
[18:16:13] Vincint Abernathy: Likewise, what I think we should focus on moving forward is our next objective, i'm sure Marcus is fine.
[18:16:33] Andrew Philip: I've started working on the tunnel
[18:16:45] Andrew Philip: it may take some time until its finished
[18:16:48] Vincint Abernathy: hows progress looking?
[18:17:04] Andrew Philip: 5%.
[18:17:24] Vincint Abernathy: ok... not bad for a couple of days solo in all honestly

[18:20:49] Andrew Philip: so
[18:20:50] Andrew Philip: who
[18:20:56] Andrew Philip: do you think we should try to invite first
[18:21:36] Vincint Abernathy: No idea, if you said they might be potential loyalist it's probably best we leave them be until we know for sure.
[18:22:27] Andrew Philip: Todd is certain, Calvin dosen't know what CWU even is, as for Sophia she saw me in the 404 zone... but I don't think any of them would like this either so your right, its better to keep a distance for now
[18:23:32] Andrew Philip: I got bleach, don't drink it
[18:23:52] Andrew Philip: you wanna have a look at your cat statue god
[18:24:05] Vincint Abernathy: /looc sorry back

[18:45:50] Andrew Philip: The dark side of The force is a pathway to many abilites, some consider to be unnatural
[18:45:52] Vincint Abernathy: ...

[18:46:36] Andrew Philip: Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew. Then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.
