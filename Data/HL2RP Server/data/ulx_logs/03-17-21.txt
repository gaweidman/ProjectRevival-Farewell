[21:02:17] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.36012: The bureaucracy is slow, however. The plan instead is to fight further progression by staging a raid on their current building.
[21:02:20] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.36012: Make them lose some records.
[21:02:57] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.36012: At night, when they're closed, we're going to send in some conscripts nonchalantly.
[21:03:33] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.36012: We burn the records, knock over some chairs, rip apart some books, make it look like a madman did it.
