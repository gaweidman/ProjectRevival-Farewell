[00:28:01] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm ashton Alright, well, we're a multi-server network. As a whole, we're over a year old, but our HL2RP server isn't a year old yet. The 4th of april will be our anniversary.
[00:28:12] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: come here often?

[00:28:45] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: // good god
[00:28:49] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: // it's 2:30 AM
[00:29:06] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm ashton Our biggest attractions are our large-scale events and the custom content I program. This server is my passion, and I love doing work for it.
[00:29:14] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm ashton We do large D&D style campaigns
[00:29:19] Elias Bartholomew: // im actually retarded
[00:29:25] Elias Bartholomew: // how tf did i forget how i got out
[00:29:25] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm ashton So, large overarching stories that take place over several events
[00:29:44] Elias Bartholomew: // i literally just did it
[00:29:50] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm ashton They tend to involve large universal concepts, we take a lot of pride in those.
[00:30:11] Elias Bartholomew: // mega brain
[00:30:14] Ashton Graves: /pm I3 Very nice! Can I know a bit about the custom content if that'd be alright?
[00:30:57] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm ashton Yep, no problem. So far, I've written a system for blood donation, a system for apartment tenants, written some factions that handle strange classes automatically
[00:31:11] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm ashton Things like xenian chars, synth chars, cremators, all them
[00:31:19] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm ashton Let's see, what else
[00:31:47] Client "dystress" connected.
[00:31:55] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm ashton Oh right, not sure how I forgot. I wrote an entire custom viewdata script...
[00:32:15] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm ashton Right now, I'm working on a system to automatically handle promotions, as well as a system for antlion grub collecting and refilling health dispensers.

[00:40:25] Ashton Graves: /pm i3 I think I was actually a CP here
[00:40:56] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm ashton Let me check the database from before
[00:40:56] Ashton Graves: /pm i3 Unsure if this'll be a good thing or a bad thing to bring up but do you remember 'William Caldwell'?

[00:41:14] Ashton Graves: /pm i3 Ahh..all good
[00:41:25] dystress<STEAM_0:0:178506700> changed their name to Leon Wakefield
[00:41:33] Leon Wakefield: // absolutely nothing changed

[00:41:43] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: //are you having one of those weird dwonload blockages
[00:41:48] Leon Wakefield: // idk
[00:41:49] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: //if you look in the console does it just repeat 0% downloaded
[00:41:56] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm ashton According to the database, you haven't been on the HL2RP. Maybe the SWRP?
[00:42:00] Leon Wakefield: // doesnt seem so
[00:42:15] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: //maybe unsubscribe and resubscribe?
[00:42:26] Ashton Graves: /pm i3 Odd..feels like I have, I remember faintly the blood drawing system and the grub harvesting system being worked on
[00:42:33] Ashton Graves: /pm i3 Oh well!
[00:42:58] Elias Bartholomew: // is there anything down here besides zombies and loot
[00:43:06] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: //acid
[00:43:09] Elias Bartholomew: // perhaps a *secret* area
[00:43:14] Elias Bartholomew: // nice
[00:43:29] Ashton Graves: /pm i3 So is there any other neat stuff you can tell me about the server?
[00:43:31] Elias Bartholomew was killed by trigger_hurt
[00:43:36] Elias Bartholomew: // fuck goddamn it
[00:43:37] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm ashton Either way, it's great to have you. We're also working on expandng our crafting system. It's there, but expanding it so it's worth something is planned
[00:43:39] Leon Wakefield: What the hell..
[00:43:40] Elias Bartholomew: // i got folded
[00:44:05] Elias Bartholomew: // hazmat cp units when
[00:44:05] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm ashton Well, as you probably saw in the server name, we're using 100% Beta Lore, with a bit of HL:Alyx lore mixed in.
[00:44:11] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: //when uhhhhh
[00:44:17] Ashton Graves: /pm i3 Ty for having me! I was curious if you needed some Civil Protection, or what donation stuff you have availible
[00:44:23] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: //when grunts become useless
[00:44:57] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm ashton At the moment, we've got HL2RP perks for stuff up to $15. I'd love to have it up to the max tier of $25, but it's difficult thinking of Non-Combine perks. They're listed on our website, projectrevival.xyz/donate
[00:45:01] Leon Wakefield: // i walked into a room full of errors and they sounded like houndeyes
[00:45:04] Leon Wakefield: // that was the hardest nope of my life

[00:45:15] Elias Bartholomew: // yes they were
[00:45:19] Elias Bartholomew: // tons of mf monsters
[00:45:27] Elias Bartholomew: // feel like im playing a dungeon crawler
[00:45:32] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm ashton More CCA wouldn't hurt, we do IC apps and OOC apps
[00:45:55] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm ashton We're currently in the process of redoing our OOC app format because I had to write a new CCA guide, so now we've got that out. 53 pages
[00:45:57] Ashton Graves: /pm I3 I'm much better with IC apps sadly, I don't do well with nobody to RP with and just writing a bajillion page essay
[00:46:04] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm ashton I feel that
[00:47:01] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm ashton We also have conscripts, a guide for that is in the works
[00:47:07] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm ashton I've got like, 5 different guides to write so
[00:47:10] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm ashton all fun
[00:47:12] Ashton Graves: /pm i3 Neat! Conscripts are always cool to play
[00:47:32] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm ashton Yeah. I'm not the biggest fan of conscripts, but players like them, and they're beta, so I figured we would include them
[00:47:37] Ashton Graves: /pm i3 I prefer CCA though because I get the beaty stick
[00:47:57] Elias Bartholomew: // ayo matt
[00:48:12] Elias Bartholomew: // got a present for you in the hospital check in area
[00:48:15] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm ashton There's a lot of different beta combine units, I'd love to be able to have players using all of them, things like the elite synths, the super soldiers, alien assassins, all that fun stuff. That's in the future though
[00:48:22] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: //Metagame? :DDDD

[00:49:19] Ashton Graves: /pm i3 Is there any neat stuff for the alien faction to DO? Other then just..provide antags for the players?
[00:49:43] Elias Bartholomew: // the combine hate dababy
[00:49:46] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm ashton At the moment it's mostly just antags for the players. Chumtoads are popular to play as just because they're goofy, but they have no real use outside of that.
[00:50:10] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm ashton maybe passiveRP, come to think of it
[00:50:10] Ashton Graves: /pm i3 Gotcha, well...do you have plans to continue this server regardless? I'd be willing to donate if so!
[00:50:29] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm ashton I do, I don't plan on calling Project Revival quits until I am literally homeless
