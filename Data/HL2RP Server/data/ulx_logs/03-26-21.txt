[20:43:19] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: Unless it is, I wouldn't know.
[20:43:20] Leon Wakefield: I got one, I just... didn't read it, I guess.
[20:43:24] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: it's not
[20:43:30] Leon Wakefield: /me gently takes it and reads carefully.
[20:43:35] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: There you have it. So what's next then?
[20:43:41] Leon Wakefield: Outpost X-Ray?
[20:43:50] Jacob Lawson: Yeah. Want the short story or the long story?
[20:43:53] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: hm
[20:43:59] Jacob Lawson: /me takes the notepad and throws it over the other edge.
[20:44:04] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: Join the PT,
[20:44:06] Leon Wakefield: You got somewhere in-between?
[20:44:10] Jacob Lawson: I can try.
[20:44:22] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /looc i dont see it
[20:44:25] Jacob Lawson: So the Combine does a lot off of radio.
[20:44:36] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /looc nvm
[20:44:38] Jacob Lawson: Including basically all of its important communications, both between precincts and within them.
[20:44:39] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: Right.
[20:44:48] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: right
[20:44:57] Jacob Lawson: They had a network of small radio arrays that patched together all the precincts, right?
[20:45:15] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: Citizen, I suggest going to your apartment.
[20:45:22] Jacob Lawson: So you had this, basically web of radio arrrays. You could use it to talk to any precinct, any time.
[20:45:45] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: // there's thunder and lightning so i might have to leave abruptly
[20:45:45] Jacob Lawson: You say something into the radio, it's picked up by the nearest array. Where's it going? Not here? Alright, pass it on.
[20:45:49] Jacob Lawson: It just keeps doing that.
[20:45:54] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /ooc peculiar 
[20:45:56] Jacob Lawson: So eventually it gets there.
[20:46:23] Jacob Lawson: A communication web sounds good, but it's not the *most* efficeint.
[20:46:25] Jacob Lawson: .//efficient
[20:46:33] Jacob Lawson: Especially when you're doing what those units are doing.
[20:46:54] Jacob Lawson to admins: if you have to ask comamnd or high command anything, make sure you please esnd the radio message in here so i can respond IC
[20:47:06] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212 to admins: got it
[20:47:13] Jacob Lawson: So to fix it, they built this *massive*, I mean huge radio array down on the beach.
[20:47:22] Client "靓仔" connected.
[20:47:36] Jacob Lawson: It's powerful enough to cover the entire city and into the outside areas.
[20:47:40] Jacob Lawson: I'm talking into the outlands
[20:47:45] Jacob Lawson: This thing is strong.
[20:48:03] Jacob Lawson: They put it at this base called outpost XRAY.
[20:48:19] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: why can't *one* day be normal?
[20:48:27] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: Good question.
[20:48:41] Client "靓仔" connected.
[20:48:43] Jacob Lawson: That doesn't really matter, though.
[20:49:04] Jacob Lawson: Until you realize that there's only one big tower separating this city from the rest of itself and the rest of the world.
[20:49:33] Jacob Lawson: So it's a giant weak spot for the Combine.
[20:49:34] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: /r We found a notepad,
[20:49:43] Jacob Lawson: If that thing goes down, the city could easily go to shit. At least in their eyes.
[20:49:49] Jacob Lawson: For us, it would rocket right up to heaven.
[20:49:57] Leon Wakefield: Oh...
[20:50:01] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: I found a similar one when you take a right at that T-section.
[20:50:02] Jacob Lawson: Not like we're dying.
[20:50:08] Leon Wakefield: Well, I guess I can tell you why I'm up here...
[20:50:08] Jacob Lawson: Like they'd be fucked is the... analogy.
[20:50:13] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: /r It reads: "Outpost XRAY is open, City 17 is vulnerable. Spread the word."
[20:50:15] Jacob Lawson: Yeah, go ahead.
[20:50:23] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212 to admins: reported the notepad
[20:50:36] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: /toggleraise
[20:50:37] Leon Wakefield: Someone knocked on my apartment door. Presumably... you? Or a cohort of yours? They left that note, I believe.
[20:50:44] Leon Wakefield: I didn't read it. I just placed it on the kitchen counter.
[20:50:57] Leon Wakefield: Woah...
[20:50:57] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: /me picks the notepad up, shoving it in somewhere
[20:51:00] Jacob Lawson to admins: copy that, see if you can find a source while we try to get the power worked out.
[20:51:00] Leon Wakefield: Just got so foggy all the sudden.
[20:51:02] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: .// pretend i pick it up

[20:51:10] Leon Wakefield: Anyway, a few minutes later the cops bust down my door.
[20:51:13] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: Alright
[20:51:14] Jacob Lawson to admins: the entire radio array web is down because they were expecting the tower to work, so we're isolated from all the other precincts.
[20:51:20] Leon Wakefield: One decides to assault me and pressure me about why the hell I kept that note.
[20:51:24] Leon Wakefield: I didn't know what he was talking about.
[20:51:32] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: How could... hmmm.
[20:51:36] Jacob Lawson to admins: These hybrid radios are working locally, not off of a repeater that increases the range one-thousandfold.
[20:51:36] Leon Wakefield: I eventually.. Instinctively pushed him off of me and ran off.
[20:51:41] Leon Wakefield: I don't know where the hell--
[20:51:41] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /me would be thinking about the context of the message.
[20:51:48] Leon Wakefield: What was that noise?
[20:51:51] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: /r We're going to sweep UHB Manufacturing.
[20:51:58] Leon Wakefield: Sounded like a picture being taken.
[20:51:59] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212 to admins: just said we're sweeping manufacturing

[20:52:39] Jacob Lawson: Damn. Something's got them riled up.
[20:52:44] Jacob Lawson: Wonder if it's these.
[20:52:54] Jacob Lawson: /me takes out a notepad, looks at it for a second, and then throws it right back out.
[20:53:17] Leon Wakefield: So you want some sort of... rebellion force to take down their communications or something?
[20:53:18] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: on the wall
