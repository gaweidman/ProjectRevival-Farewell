[12:44:25] Ken Fai: Hello there sir.
[12:44:33] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: Relocation coupon.
[12:44:46] Ken Fai: /me Puts his relocation coupon threw the slot.
[12:45:05] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /me takes the relocation coupon and examines it for a moment, front and back.
[12:45:22] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /me would then turn around and inspect it in the light. He seems to be making sure it's not counterfeit.
[12:45:50] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /me would then, satisfied, move over to the CID printer and insert the coupon.
[12:46:34] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /me takes the ID off of the table and steps back up to the counter.
[12:46:36] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /me takes out their datapad and types a couple things in.
[12:46:50] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: I need your name, sex, and any physical or mental illnesses you may have.
[12:47:10] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /viewdata  ken
[12:47:46] Ken Fai: My name is Ken Fai. I am male. I have hyper-flexible joints if that counts as a physical illness.
[12:48:12] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: Yeah, that counts. Not as an illness, though. Double jointed, you mean?
[12:48:16] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /viewdata  ken
[12:48:42] Ken Fai: I'm not sure. I've always been told it was hyper-flexible, and that's all.
[12:48:49] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: Hm. Alright.
[12:48:53] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: And your date of birth?

[12:50:29] Ken Fai: 1982 is my date of birth sir.
[12:50:48] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: What's the day and month?
[12:51:08] Ken Fai: The 11th of April.
[12:51:48] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: Alright, and what's your blood type?
[12:51:52] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: If you don't know, that's fine.
[12:52:04] Ken Fai: I don't know sir.
[12:52:23] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: Alright.
[12:52:27] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /viewdata  ken
[12:54:07] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: There's a store in the plaza that sells filters, and there are air vents around the city, you'll recognize them by how they look. You can also donate blood in the blood donation stations scattered around the city.
[12:55:03] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: We're in the middle of a resin buyback, so if you find any small pucks of metal, you can turn them into the Resin Terminal in district two.
[12:55:13] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: Do you have any questions for me?
[12:55:40] Ken Fai: Uh, I think my only question is where I can retrieve my rations in the city.
[12:56:34] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: We do regular ration distribution at the big building near Warehouse 3.
[12:56:59] Ken Fai: Ok, thank you good sir.

[12:57:50] Ken Fai: /me He would grab the ID calmly.
[12:58:08] Ken Fai: I will stay out of trouble good sir.
[12:58:11] Ken Fai: Thank you.
[12:58:20] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: Yep.

[13:02:27] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: //brb
[13:08:39] Ken Fai: /me Picks up the notepad, slowly looking around while doing it.
[13:09:17] Ken Fai: /me Throws the notepad under the generator.
[13:15:02] Ken Fai: /me Reaches under to grab the notepad back.
[13:15:37] Ken Fai: /me Tosses the notepad over.
[13:17:24] Ken Fai: /me Pickups the notepad and slowly reads it.
[13:18:03] Ken Fai: /me Hides the notepad under the generator.
[13:19:45] Ken Fai: /me Examines the vent curiously.
[13:20:03] Ken Fai: /me Drops down into the vent after a careful consideration.
[13:22:11] Ken Fai: /me Looks out of the window carefully, then hops out the window.
[13:22:27] Ken Fai: /me Picks the resin up.

[14:04:27] Leon Wakefield: Err...
[14:04:27] Ken Fai: Uh, hello there.
[14:04:39] Leon Wakefield: Got any business in the sewers?
[14:05:03] Ken Fai: Uhm, I'm just looking for resin, filters, and other goodies down.
[14:05:10] Leon Wakefield: Oh.. thats fair.
[14:05:16] Leon Wakefield: You seem rather torn up though.
[14:05:23] Ken Fai: I can say the same to you.
[14:05:32] Leon Wakefield: Yeah.. this place is pseudo-hell.
[14:05:37] Leon Wakefield: I don't have any other place at this point, though.
[14:05:43] Leon Wakefield: Except that construction site.
[14:05:51] Ken Fai: I've been running into zombies, bullsquids, houndeyes.
[14:06:02] Leon Wakefield: I can't even name half the creatures down here.
[14:06:12] Ken Fai: I've managed to kill a Combine zombie with one of those tentacle things.
[14:06:22] Leon Wakefield: Tentacle things?
[14:06:37] Ken Fai: They have those little rope looking tonques.
[14:06:45] Leon Wakefield: Ohh... Barnacles.
[14:06:58] Leon Wakefield: I only know they're named that off some other guy.
[14:07:13] Ken Fai: Ah, interesting.
[14:07:30] Leon Wakefield: Well, I set up a bit of a safe room in here. Its just down that way. Theres two empty rooms beside 'em.
[14:07:46] Leon Wakefield: Theres also that path down there with an empty room, but its got some zombie corpses.
[14:07:53] Ken Fai: Dead or alive?
[14:07:58] Leon Wakefield: Dead. I think.
[14:08:07] Leon Wakefield: They always seem to come back...
[14:08:24] Ken Fai: I think you gotta kill those things on their head.
[14:08:42] Leon Wakefield: Well, yeah. I've just been bashing those head things in with this frying pan.
[14:08:45] Leon Wakefield: Seems rather efficient, actually.
[14:09:04] Ken Fai: Hmm, where did you acquire this pan? I might like getting one myself actually.
[14:09:14] Leon Wakefield: Sold in the general store.
[14:09:29] Ken Fai: Ah, I'll be sure to try and get one later.
[14:10:03] Leon Wakefield: Well, I guess you can keep doing your thing I guess. I'm trying to look for some sort of medical supplies, but really, no luck.
[14:10:17] Ken Fai: Hah, same thing. I'm mostly looking for meds.
[14:10:31] Ken Fai: Well, have a good one. I hope you don't die out there. 
[14:10:31] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: //i did it

[14:10:37] Leon Wakefield: // win
[14:12:00] Leon Wakefield: Down theres the room I was talking about.
[14:12:20] Leon Wakefield: This places got no zombies.
[14:12:47] Leon Wakefield: I don't know who previously owned it.
[14:12:50] Leon Wakefield: Theyre most likely dead...
[14:12:57] Leon Wakefield: But its like a junk haven.
[14:13:18] Ken Fai: Hmm, odd I found two notepads talking about various things.
[14:13:31] Ken Fai: One was talking about this base called XRAY.
[14:13:47] Ken Fai: The other was talking about various items needed for a home or something.
[14:14:00] Leon Wakefield: The X-RAY note is uh, why I'm down here.e
[14:14:22] Leon Wakefield: Some cop barged down my door in my apartment because there was a note I found on the ground that I took inside.
[14:14:32] Leon Wakefield: Instinctively I pushed the cop off of me and ran away.
[14:14:41] Leon Wakefield: So I'm probably gonna be dead when I see another one of them.
[14:14:49] Ken Fai: Well dang.
[14:15:00] Leon Wakefield: Check this room out.
[14:15:10] Ken Fai: Huh, locked.
[14:15:13] Leon Wakefield: Yeah...
[14:15:17] Leon Wakefield: I don't know whats in it.
[14:15:25] Ken Fai: Wow.
[14:15:30] Leon Wakefield: Theres loads of random stuff in here.
[14:15:52] Leon Wakefield: Maybe you can take the wrench, if you want.
[14:15:58] Leon Wakefield: For bashing heads in.
[14:16:07] Ken Fai: I'll see if it's worthy enough.
[14:16:21] Ken Fai: /me Picks up the wrench examining it for battle potential.
[14:16:42] Ken Fai: Seems good enough.
[14:16:54] Leon Wakefield: [[ its an error in my screen and i dont know what addon uses the model so thats why i didnt really take it for myself

[14:18:00] Ken Fai: Woah.
[14:18:04] Leon Wakefield: I didnt go down it yet.
[14:18:07] Leon Wakefield: I fear its a one-way.
[14:18:16] Ken Fai: /looc Oh shoot.
[14:18:29] Ken Fai: /looc Just drank bleach by accident.

[14:21:33] Leon Wakefield: I mean, sure, I suppose.
[14:21:38] Ken Fai: // Well when you're trying to drop items on large scales.
[14:21:47] Leon Wakefield: If it IS a one-way, I can just open it up for you.

[14:24:17] Ken Fai: So, I think there may be a place with guns.
[14:24:31] Ken Fai: I was exploring around the construction zone when I came across a pit filled with zombies.
[14:24:40] Leon Wakefield: Oh?
[14:24:58] Ken Fai: In the pit there was a dead Combine grunt.
[14:25:16] Leon Wakefield: Hmm..
[14:25:34] Leon Wakefield: You think we could handle a pit of zombies while we're basically hanging on by a thread?
[14:25:55] Ken Fai: The bad part is the pit is infested with fast headcrabs and other monsters like the big zombies that shoot acid at you.
[14:26:32] Ken Fai: There is a door on the other side, but I wouldn't exactly trust it with my life.
[14:26:55] Leon Wakefield: Think I'd want something better than a frying pan before heading down there...
[14:27:08] Leon Wakefield: Wouldn't know where to start looking.
[14:27:14] Ken Fai: I'll agree with that. Do you have any ideas where to get meds?
[14:27:42] Leon Wakefield: If youre not in trouble with the cops yet, unlike me, you could probably go to the CMU.
[14:27:56] Leon Wakefield: Explain you were, err, mugged, or something.
[14:28:07] Leon Wakefield: I dunno.
[14:28:20] Ken Fai: Hmm, alright.
[14:28:28] Leon Wakefield: I don't even know if theres any actual CMU guys yet, never seen someone behind that counter.
[14:28:42] Ken Fai: Me either.
[14:29:10] Leon Wakefield: Weird situation this city is in.
[14:29:15] Ken Fai: Yeah.
[14:30:18] Leon Wakefield: A part in the sewers I didnt really check out yet is the left path on this catwalk.
[14:30:18] Ken Fai: Fast headcrab.
[14:30:27] Leon Wakefield: Because, err, those skinny assholes...
[14:30:30] Leon Wakefield: Impossible to dodge.
[14:30:51] Ken Fai: You can head around them, but there is a room filled with dogs and the hallway has a bullsquid.
[14:31:08] Leon Wakefield: I don't know whats more deadly.
[14:31:20] Leon Wakefield: Probably the squid.
[14:31:23] Ken Fai: Yeah.
[14:31:47] Ken Fai: /y Wait
[14:31:50] Leon Wakefield: Hear that?
[14:32:03] Ken Fai: Around the corner there is a hallway to the right,
[14:32:09] Ken Fai: It has a fast zombie.
[14:33:06] Leon Wakefield: Oh.
[14:33:11] Ken Fai: That;s the squid.
[14:33:22] Leon Wakefield: This a way around?
