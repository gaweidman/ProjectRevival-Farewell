[15:18:30] Dakota Oswalt: This is the plaza. To the right of yous the err, CWU. But I have never seen anyone in there.
[15:18:37] Dakota Oswalt: Not behind the counter, not waiting, not anything.
[15:18:50] Dakota Oswalt: Here's just a regular apartment. The fanciest one, I believe.
[15:19:10] Dakota Oswalt: Thats the CMU right there--There's a little station where you can draw blood for creds.
[15:19:20] Dakota Oswalt: I assume that cop who processed you--He asked for your blood type?
[15:19:25] Caser Still: Yeah

[15:22:17] Dakota Oswalt: Down that creepy alleyway is some sort of bar that--again, I've never seen open.
[15:22:21] Dakota Oswalt: Seems business owners just kind of died out.

[15:23:27] Dakota Oswalt: Down theres another apartment block. That's... about it.
[15:23:40] Dakota Oswalt: Theres also a street down where you can deposit "resin," but its hard to come by. Gives you money, though.
[15:24:08] Dakota Oswalt: This section of the city is kind of small.. Maybe they'll open up more streets one day.
[15:24:15] Dakota Oswalt: But theres also a work cycle they announce every now and then.
[15:24:21] Dakota Oswalt: If you're productive you get loads of tokens.
[15:24:26] Dakota Oswalt: I don't know what to spend 'em on, though.
[15:24:42] Dakota Oswalt: Relatively quiet city.
[15:24:55] Caser Still: Seems about it.
[15:24:59] Dakota Oswalt: You can also ask a cop for an apartment.
[15:25:04] Caser Still: Not many people around, huh.
[15:25:08] Dakota Oswalt: Yeah...
[15:25:10] Dakota Oswalt: I always found that odd.

[16:27:13] Dakota Oswalt: Oh jeez..
[16:27:22] Caser Still: but that would mean pretty bad for us ever coming back.

[16:27:53] Caser Still: Get really good guns and armor.
[16:27:59] Caser Still: I think that's what the price goes about.
[16:28:01] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212 to admins: what's taking so long
[16:28:01] Dakota Oswalt: Four thousand?!
[16:28:07] Caser Still: Yeah.
[16:28:13] Caser Still: It's a lot.
[16:28:13] Dakota Oswalt: How..?
[16:28:23] Caser Still: That's why robbing a cop would be ten times easier.
[16:28:29] Caser Still: But risky.
[16:28:46] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: And do you know your blood type?
[16:28:48] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594 to admins: it's... not?
[16:28:48] Caser Still: But there are two of us.
[16:28:50] Dakota Oswalt: I mean, trying to beat up those plastic husks is...
[16:28:53] Caser Still: One of him.
[16:29:00] Dakota Oswalt: But two bullets is easily enough.
[16:29:03] Alexandra Wang: AB-
[16:29:05] Caser Still: Well, one of us grabs his arms and the other beats him over the head
[16:29:06] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212 to admins: you've been processing that guy for a while?

[16:29:22] Caser Still: We need a weapon tho.
[16:29:22] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: alright
[16:29:28] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: Coming at you with a lot of information.
[16:29:30] Caser Still: If we could find a knife.
[16:29:37] Caser Still: We can kill a cop...
[16:29:39] Marcus Weller: Excuse me. Can I have some work?
[16:29:39] Dakota Oswalt: We could literally just... buy a pan from the vendor.
[16:29:41] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: .// uwu

[16:29:53] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.59212: .// got it
[16:29:53] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: You can buy filters at a store in the plaza, you can donate blood for tokens at the blood donation stations around the city. We do ration cycles en masse regularly. If you need food or water between cycles, buy them from stores and vending machines.
[16:29:55] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: Sure. Come with me.
[16:29:58] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: /looc lmao
[16:29:59] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: We are in the middle of a resin buyback, so if you find any blueish pucks of metal, you can turn them in to a terminal in D2 in exchange for tokens.
[16:30:03] Caser Still: Their necks are not so protected tho.
[16:30:05] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: There are air vents that we install around the city, you can tell if they pump out fresh air by looking at them.
[16:30:18] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: Do you have any questions?
[16:30:24] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: Stand in front of that sign.
[16:30:24] Dakota Oswalt: I'd bet there's lots of steel to just snag from the sewers.
[16:30:27] Dakota Oswalt: Make a knife out of that...
[16:30:30] Dakota Oswalt: If we knew how to.
[16:30:31] Caser Still: Yeah.
[16:30:37] Caser Still: It can't be that hard.
[16:30:41] Alexandra Wang: No, I think I got it
[16:30:43] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.74645: You get two options, pick one: street sweeping or garbage collection.
[16:30:43] Caser Still: We just have to find something sharp.
[16:30:57] Caser Still: We could do it with a glass shard as well honestly
[16:31:03] Marcus Weller: Street sweeping.
[16:31:03] Dakota Oswalt: Holy--
[16:31:09] Caser Still: Who the fuck are you?
