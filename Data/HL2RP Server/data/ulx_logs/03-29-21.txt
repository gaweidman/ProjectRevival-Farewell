[21:54:18] Leon Wakefield: I didn't go really far out into there obviously, but I just glanced at it.
[21:54:22] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i2.69124 to admins: I said i would do it for you and you said thank you
[21:54:23] Ryan Maley: Yeah, apparently it's some big radio array.
[21:54:25] Leon Wakefield: Seems theres antlions out there too where it was.
[21:54:27] CCA.C17-UNION.OfC.56321<STEAM_0:1:17219621> changed their name to Owen 'Unknown' Clark
[21:54:30] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i2.69124 to admins: famthner am confused
[21:54:33] Ryan Maley to admins: i thought you were talking about doing the training for me
[21:54:40] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i2.69124 to admins: bruh
[21:54:43] CCA.C17-QrM.52934 to admins: should we uh
[21:54:46] CCA.C17-QrM.52934 to admins: undo his char
[21:54:48] Ryan Maley to admins: yes
[21:54:57] Ryan Maley to admins: i will apologize to him for the mistake
[21:55:06] Leon Wakefield: So, X-RAY is the big one and not the small connector, eh? Glad thats cleared out of the way.
[21:55:18] Ryan Maley: Yeah, it doesn't seem like it's a huge deal in the grand scheme of things.
[21:55:23] CCA.C17-QrM.52934 to admins: ugh
[21:55:24] Ryan Maley: I was expecting something top secret.
[21:55:26] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i2.69124: /charsetname RCT Marcus Weller
[21:55:26] CCA.C17-RCT.71085<STEAM_0:1:51616733> changed their name to Marcus Weller
[21:55:29] CCA.C17-QrM.52934 to admins: whats the hazmat suit model
[21:55:37] Leon Wakefield: Then I wonder what the entire city was so riled up about.
[21:55:38] Ryan Maley to admins: hazmat suit model?
[21:55:39] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: You fucking scared me
[21:55:47] Cooper 'Coop' Barns: I did what you asked
[21:55:49] CCA.C17-QrM.52934: /plytransfer marc citizen
[21:55:51] Ryan Maley to admins: I couldn't say, but I've got a good guess.
[21:55:51] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Good ot know
[21:55:51] Leon Wakefield: During the whole big event where all the notes were being passed around, all the lights just...
[21:55:53] Leon Wakefield: Switched off.
[21:55:54] Ryan Maley to admins: shit wrong chat
[21:55:55] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: .// to*
[21:55:59] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i2.69124: /charsetmodel marcus models/player/zelpa/male_07_extended.mdl
[21:56:00] CCA.C17-QrM.52934 to admins: i mean the citizen suit
[21:56:08] CCA.C17-QrM.52934 to admins: i mean
[21:56:10] Ryan Maley to admins: just give him a regular citizen suit model
[21:56:10] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: I'm glad, now return to the city and act as our smuggler.
[21:56:12] CCA.C17-QrM.52934 to admins: he does have his training done
[21:56:13] Leon Wakefield: And then some backup.. generator? Of sorts? Turned everything back on.
[21:56:15] CCA.C17-QrM.52934 to admins: so
[21:56:16] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: You will be the city general.
[21:56:23] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: And have all jurisdiction in that area.
[21:56:29] Cooper 'Coop' Barns: well
[21:56:29] CCA.C17-QrM.52934: /toggleraise
[21:56:29] Marcus Weller suicided!
[21:56:35] Cooper 'Coop' Barns: how do you want me to get them here
[21:56:41] Cooper 'Coop' Barns: how do I know they wont rat us out?
[21:57:06] Ryan Maley: Yeah, I managed to intercept a report on that. It didn't seem like anything too big of a deal. The most important thing about it is that it connects all of City 17's radio communications.
[21:57:10] Dropped "Marcus Weller" from server<STEAM_0:1:51616733>
[21:57:14] Ryan Maley: So if that thing goes down, City 17 is cut off from the rest of the world.
[21:57:17] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: That is up to you, you'll be self-governing within reason and set the people who will assist you in these endeavors.
[21:57:24] CCA.C17-QrM.52934: // he had to go to bed
[21:57:28] Leon Wakefield: So what did the notes mean by it being exposed?
[21:57:35] Cooper 'Coop' Barns: Alright
[21:57:36] Ryan Maley: /me would take out his combat knife and cut the individual's ties.
[21:57:38] Ryan Maley: .//void, fuck
[21:57:45] Ryan Maley: What did the notes say again? Refresh my memory.
[21:57:46] Leon Wakefield: [[ awesome bind
[21:57:47] Cooper 'Coop' Barns: Ill tell them to meet you at those smaller houses
[21:57:51] Cooper 'Coop' Barns: so be expecting
[21:57:51] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i2.69124<STEAM_0:1:127409364> changed their name to Preobrazhensky Bogolepov
[21:57:55] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Good to know
[21:57:56] Leon Wakefield: "X-RAY is exposed" or something like that, that's all.
[21:58:08] Leon Wakefield: Or maybe it said vulnerabl--Anyway, same thing.
[21:58:33] Cooper 'Coop' Barns: Yo
[21:58:39] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: /ru Hello?
[21:58:46] Cooper 'Coop' Barns: Niet
[21:58:48] Ryan Maley: I'm not sure. My guess is that it was some opportunistic person or group of people who knew what XRAY going down meant.
[21:58:50] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: /ru What?
[21:58:53] Cooper 'Coop' Barns: What?
[21:58:58] Cooper 'Coop' Barns: I speak english
[21:58:59] Ryan Maley: Y'know, the whole being cut off from communications thing.
[21:59:20] Leon Wakefield: Yeah, I agree.
[21:59:20] Ryan Maley: From the report that I got, it seems like the tower drew way more power than the Combine expected.
[21:59:34] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: /me turns on the radio
[21:59:35] Leon Wakefield: Oh...
[21:59:42] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Ah, are you one of my recruits?
[21:59:42] Leon Wakefield: So thats why all the lights knocked out.
[21:59:45] Ryan Maley: Yep.
[21:59:46] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: Yes
[21:59:57] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Good to know, this will be your home from now on.
[22:00:04] Ryan Maley: But when that went out, the whole system was, no pun intended here, shocked.
[22:00:09] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: Better than the city
[22:00:10] Ryan Maley: So it all came down with it.
[22:00:29] Leon Wakefield: So it technically WAS vulnerable..?
[22:00:31] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Welcome to Shell Beach United.
[22:00:37] Ryan Maley: It was more than vulnerable.
[22:00:44] Ryan Maley: The tower was entirely down.
[22:00:48] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: /ru oh you again
[22:00:54] Leon Wakefield: Physically or..
[22:00:55] Cooper 'Coop' Barns: You know the russian?
[22:01:02] Ryan Maley: not physically. electricitywise.
[22:01:04] Ryan Maley: It wasn't running.
[22:01:04] Leon Wakefield: Yeah.
[22:01:11] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Why are you here? I put you in the city if i'm correct.
[22:01:19] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Was there an issue?
[22:01:22] Cooper 'Coop' Barns: I need my crowbar
[22:01:23] Ryan Maley: I'm not sure if you're misremembering, because the tower being vulnerable doesn't seem to make sense to point out.
[22:01:24] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Ah
[22:01:34] Ryan Maley: Maybe I'm just crazy, or the guy who wrote the note is.
[22:01:36] Leon Wakefield: No, no, thats definitely what the note said.
[22:01:40] Ryan Maley: hm
[22:01:40] Cooper 'Coop' Barns: Ill check in with ya in a week
[22:01:41] Ryan Maley: weird
[22:01:43] Cooper 'Coop' Barns: see ya
[22:01:44] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Alrighty
[22:01:45] Ryan Maley: I'm not seeing anything about a backup generator, but I see something about a known pre-war generator.
[22:01:52] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: That is one of our older members.
[22:02:04] Leon Wakefield: Know where it is?
[22:02:04] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: Mhmmm
[22:02:07] Ryan Maley: They had to turn it back on so they could kick start other power facilities back on.
[22:02:13] CCA.C17-QrM.52934 to admins: so uh
[22:02:15] Ryan Maley: Yes, I do, but not from their documentation.
[22:02:15] CCA.C17-QrM.52934 to admins: q
[22:02:17] Ryan Maley to admins: yeah
[22:02:20] CCA.C17-QrM.52934 to admins: uh
[22:02:21] Leon Wakefield: What from, then?
[22:02:30] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Now as you are one of us you'll be placing any rebels you see into our group, forcefully or peacefully.
[22:02:31] CCA.C17-QrM.52934 to admins: chickens like right in front of the conscript base lmao
[22:02:35] Ryan Maley: .//hold on
[22:02:37] Ryan Maley teleported to CCA.C17-QrM.52934
[22:02:56] Ryan Maley to admins: if he walks in front of it again hit the alarm and send out light as a conscript and yourself as a coastal OTA
[22:02:56] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: We are here to take over and rule this outlands as one.
[22:03:00] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Not in packs spread out.
[22:03:05] CCA.C17-QrM.52934 to admins: sure
[22:03:10] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Do you understand?
[22:03:11] Ryan Maley to admins: but he has to walk in front of the window within very clear sight
[22:03:15] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: Yup
[22:03:19] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Oh and here.
[22:03:20] Ryan Maley returned Themself to their original position
[22:03:24] Ryan Maley: .//sorry, admin shit
[22:03:26] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: /me Holds out a CCA issue Combat knife.
[22:03:28] Leon Wakefield: [[ no worries
[22:03:30] CCA.C17-QrM.52934 to admins: yeah
[22:03:32] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: Ooh
[22:03:32] Ryan Maley: I've got some schematics from what the generator was from before.
[22:03:38] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Better than no weapon right?
[22:03:39] CCA.C17-QrM.52934 to admins: im not gonna noclip in weird corners to get a glimpse
[22:03:46] Ryan Maley to admins: yeah
[22:03:51] Ryan Maley: It's part of what used to be a large underground power facility.
[22:03:52] CCA.C17-QrM.52934 to admins: i dislike him but he still deserves somewhat fair stuff
[22:03:55] Ryan Maley to admins: agree
[22:03:59] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: /toggleraise
[22:04:02] Leon Wakefield: Underground, eh?
[22:04:03] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: /toggleraise
[22:04:04] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: /toggleraise
[22:04:07] CCA.C17-QrM.52934 to admins: everyone deserves equal rights, except you
[22:04:11] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Alrighty, i'll leave you be for now.
[22:04:11] Leon Wakefield: What are the odds they're here in the sewers?
[22:04:12] CCA.C17-QrM.52934 to admins: <3
[22:04:12] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov to admins: woah there
[22:04:14] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Actually one more thing.
[22:04:14] Ryan Maley to admins: yeah, the generator is underground.
[22:04:19] Ryan Maley to admins: fuck, wrong chat
[22:04:24] Ryan Maley: yeah, the generator is underground. 
[22:04:32] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: I am Owen Clark but officially speaking I am referred to as "unknown" for privacy.
[22:04:37] Ryan Maley: One hundred perecent, that's exactly where it is.
[22:04:40] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: And you are?
[22:04:43] Ryan Maley: It's not a they, it's just one generator.
[22:04:52] Leon Wakefield: One?
[22:04:52] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: Just call me Pre, it's easier
[22:04:53] Ryan Maley: But from what it seems to say, the generator isn't being used anymore.
[22:04:57] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Good to know
[22:04:59] Ryan Maley: Yeah, but it's a really big one.
[22:05:01] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: /toggleraise
[22:05:29] Leon Wakefield: I did on a journey find some sort of massive blue.. machine, right next to a bunch of soda machines and a horde of zombies, but thats probably not it.
[22:05:36] Leon Wakefield: It was underground here, in the sewers.
[22:05:41] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov brought Owen 'Unknown' Clark
[22:05:41] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: !bring owen
[22:05:51] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Oh and let me show you one other thing
[22:05:55] Ryan Maley: Yeah, that's it.
[22:06:02] Ryan Maley: I don't remember it being blue, I thought it was green.
[22:06:11] Leon Wakefield: Maybe green, maybe blue.
[22:06:15] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: This will be your storage area.
[22:06:16] Ryan Maley: But yeah, that's the one.
[22:06:22] Leon Wakefield: I could literally run over there and check right now, it's not even far from me.
[22:06:31] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Keep anything you find within reason.
[22:06:38] Leon Wakefield: It's not really beefed up by any Combine machinery.
[22:06:41] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Large amounts of ammo and guns is always nice to know about.
[22:06:47] Leon Wakefield: Really odd..
[22:06:47] Ryan Maley: Yeah, I imagined. Are you in the same precinct as the Consul?
[22:06:54] Leon Wakefield: I think?
[22:07:03] Leon Wakefield: Oh, yeah, definitely.
[22:07:11] Ryan Maley: Yeah, I know where you are.
[22:07:13] Ryan Maley: Generally speaking.
[22:07:15] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: I'll be going for now
[22:07:33] Ryan Maley: But, yeah, the generator isn't a huge Combine asset. From what it's saying here, they just turned it on once to kick start their way more powerful systems.
[22:07:48] Leon Wakefield: I guess its a start on unravelling this whole thing.
[22:07:55] CCA.C17-QrM.52934<STEAM_0:0:193599766> spawned ragdoll models/hlvr/characters/hazmat_worker/hazmat_worker_ragdoll.mdl
[22:07:58] Ryan Maley: What is there to unravel?

[22:08:27] Leon Wakefield: Understanding this whole power shebang.
[22:08:34] Leon Wakefield: But... it's probably all already understood.
[22:09:07] Leon Wakefield: I swear I thought there'd be something bigger into this. The cop who tried to beat me to shit over the note seemed real distressed.
[22:09:18] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: /toggleraise
[22:09:22] CCA.C17-QrM.52934: // im going to summon laoghaire
[22:09:51] Ryan Maley: They like to get the cops riled up. I'm surprised you're not brutalized regularly like that.
[22:10:19] Ryan Maley: City 17 raids are rough.
[22:10:22] CCA.C17-QrM.52934<STEAM_0:0:193599766> changed their name to Laoghaire Fraser

[22:11:16] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: // Fuck
[22:11:26] Leon Wakefield: Yeah, I shouldn't be so surprised. I just dont quite know anymore. Felt like I was driven on this fetch-quest for a purpose.
[22:11:28] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: // Actually I might as well
[22:11:30] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: // Big tired
[22:11:34] Dropped "Cooper 'Coop' Barns" from server<STEAM_0:0:143523274>
[22:11:36] Leon Wakefield: That Jacob guy who "knew some things" definitely was the driver.
[22:11:54] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: // Tired from placing propoganda around and recruiting people into my dictatership.
[22:11:56] Dropped "Owen 'Unknown' Clark" from server<STEAM_0:1:17219621>
[22:12:12] Ryan Maley: I mean, you haven't done nothing.
[22:12:21] Ryan Maley: And hey, you met me.
[22:12:39] Leon Wakefield: How'd he know the radio station? The "frequency" paper? And then told me "You'll figure it out" soon as I fetch those two things? And you're some super top-secret guy on one of the most "important pieces of science" or something...
[22:13:02] Ryan Maley: Well, there we go. There's more to unravel.
[22:13:12] Leon Wakefield: I need to find the Jacob dude.
[22:13:20] Ryan Maley: How he knew about me is.. a mystery.
[22:13:37] Leon Wakefield: My best bet is he was in contact with your "Jessica."
[22:13:42] Ryan Maley: Yeah.
[22:13:47] Ryan Maley: I would only imagine.
[22:14:01] Ryan Maley: Jessica isn't dumb. There's a reason I gave her what I did.
[22:14:21] Leon Wakefield: And Jessica is definitely, probably, most likely dead. Or just really concerned over why her radio station isnt in that rooftop anymore.
[22:14:52] Ryan Maley: That's just the thing.
[22:15:01] Ryan Maley: I know exactly where this was before, and it's not the rooftop.
[22:15:08] Ryan Maley: .//she me-- er, something else
[22:15:18] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: /toggleraise
[22:15:22] Ryan Maley: But it was somebody she trusted enough to give the inforamtion
[22:15:25] Ryan Maley: .//information*
[22:15:49] Ryan Maley: It seems like the next thing to look into is how Jacob knew about this.
[22:15:58] Ryan Maley: Seems like he's who you need to find.
[22:16:03] Ryan Maley: Where'd you see him last?
[22:16:05] Leon Wakefield: I have no idea where to even start on him.
[22:16:15] Leon Wakefield: A rooftop, not the rooftop where the radio was, but it was overlooking it.
[22:16:17] Leon Wakefield: Way higher.
[22:16:48] Ryan Maley: Did you see any weapons on him?
[22:16:50] Leon Wakefield: I was up there to try and escape from the cops after running away from the raid, and he just decided to pop up and be cryptic and junk.
[22:16:51] Leon Wakefield: No.
[22:17:00] Ryan Maley: So he could be blending into the citizen populus.
[22:17:06] Leon Wakefield: Yeah, with the suit and all...
[22:17:14] Leon Wakefield: I'd have to deliberately go around and ask everyone if they're Jacob.
[22:17:22] Leon Wakefield: And even then, I probably won't be able to go in the city.
[22:17:33] Ryan Maley: Wait, why can't you go in the-
[22:17:33] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: /toggleraise
[22:17:35] Ryan Maley: Oh, right.
[22:18:24] Leon Wakefield: Maybe he's a sewer dweller aswell, who knows.
[22:19:23] Ryan Maley: Did you see where he went after he left?
[22:19:43] Leon Wakefield: He just kind of jumped on a big pipe to go down.
[22:19:55] Leon Wakefield: Was in clear sight of the street below, too.
[22:20:03] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: /toggleraise
[22:20:07] Leon Wakefield: From then onward, I have no idea.
[22:20:19] Ryan Maley: 17's got a lot of catwalks.
[22:20:24] Leon Wakefield: Yeah.
[22:20:28] Ryan Maley: A lot of catwalks and roof dwellings.
[22:20:32] Ryan Maley: He could be living up there.
[22:20:37] Leon Wakefield: Roof dwellings...
[22:20:45] Leon Wakefield: Maybe.
[22:20:58] Leon Wakefield: I'd have to risk my way over there and go on a rooftop adventure.
[22:21:05] Leon Wakefield: I guess thats the next logical step h ere.
[22:22:00] Ryan Maley: Well, logical is a strong word.
[22:22:14] Ryan Maley: I'm as invested in this as you are, trust me. I didn't expect the secret to get out like this.
[22:22:17] Ryan Maley: Granted, you seem capable.
[22:22:21] Ryan Maley: But still, it's not exepcted.
[22:22:23] Ryan Maley: .//expected.*
[22:22:48] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: /toggleraise
[22:22:56] Leon Wakefield: Well, there isn't much else to do from my viewpoint.
[22:23:33] Ryan Maley: So, we know you saw him in the roofs.
[22:23:34] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: /toggleraise
[22:23:36] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: /toggleraise
[22:23:37] Ryan Maley: He knew something in the sewers.
[22:23:38] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: /toggleraise
[22:23:53] Ryan Maley: He knew about the frequency.
[22:23:58] Ryan Maley: He knew about the setup.
[22:24:05] Ryan Maley: Hold on..
[22:24:08] Ryan Maley: I'm getting an idea.
[22:24:34] Ryan Maley: I uh, I have an idea.
[22:24:36] Ryan Maley: But it may sound weird.
[22:25:03] Leon Wakefield: Well I'm open to hear literally anything.
[22:25:26] Ryan Maley: Do you have any paper?
[22:25:38] Leon Wakefield: Uh.
[22:26:07] Leon Wakefield: /me grabs a bundle of scrap cloth from under the table.
[22:26:17] Leon Wakefield: I mean, it's cloth, but yeah.
[22:26:26] Ryan Maley: You're gonna need something you can right a note on.
[22:26:32] Leon Wakefield: I mean, theres toilet paper...
[22:26:34] Ryan Maley: One that won't make you look batshit insane.
[22:27:07] Leon Wakefield: It's semi-insane now.
[22:27:25] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov to admins: q sniff feet
[22:27:44] Ryan Maley: Get some paper. You have to write a letter to him.
[22:27:52] Leon Wakefield: To Jacob?
[22:28:00] Ryan Maley: Yeah.

[22:38:20] Ryan Maley: Or something you know each other by
[22:38:22] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Wonderful, because soon you'll have to move anyways.

[22:38:36] Leon Wakefield: Yeah, he knows my name.
[22:38:56] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Wonderful
[22:39:09] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: You've done well, i'll take my portion and you can keep the rest.
[22:39:20] Ryan Maley: great
[22:39:28] Ryan Maley: Maybe say you have some questions. It's up to you.
[22:39:42] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Alrighty, and all the food and a few tools you can keep.
[22:39:50] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: Alright
[22:40:23] Leon Wakefield: Okay... its written. Now do I just.. put it in the place we met? That rooftop overlook?
[22:40:24] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Now you'll be moving to a seperate location due to this being very obviously in front of the Combine.
[22:40:39] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: I have a recommendation of course.
[22:40:51] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Take everything of value with you and lets go.
[22:41:25] Ryan Maley: No. You're going to put it in the generator room. It's a common place for rebels to go.
[22:41:43] Ryan Maley: If he's not there, I would be shocked.

[22:41:54] Leon Wakefield: Oh, the generator room..?
[22:41:56] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Also take that padlock.
[22:41:57] Leon Wakefield: Well, alright then.
[22:42:09] Leon Wakefield: Anything else you wanna say before I go off there?
[22:42:54] Ryan Maley: Uhh, I will say this.
[22:42:58] Ryan Maley: You seem really capable.
[22:43:22] Ryan Maley: I was worried this frequency and setup would fall into the hands of the Combine or someone who doesn't care enough to keep it safe.
[22:43:26] Ryan Maley: I'm not worried about that.
[22:43:40] Ryan Maley: I trust you with this secret, and I trust you to figure this out.
[22:43:54] Leon Wakefield: Well, thats nice to know.
[22:44:00] Ryan Maley: There's a lot that we don't know from the Combine's standpoint. If you can get this figured out, there's a lot more to figure out.
[22:44:13] Ryan Maley: I'm not joking when I say that Outpost XRAY is the tip of the iceberg.
[22:44:22] Ryan Maley: There's a lot that they keep as a secret.
[22:44:42] Leon Wakefield: Guess they suck at keeping their secrets if you guys know a good bit, eh?
[22:45:14] Leon Wakefield: [[ i am going to single handedly destroy this city and turn it into an outlands server
[22:45:18] Ryan Maley: We don't know enough.
[22:45:25] Ryan Maley: You may be just what we need to figure it out, though.
[22:45:28] Leon Wakefield: Oh.
[22:45:30] Leon Wakefield: Someones coming.
[22:45:32] Ryan Maley: So keep that in mind when you're doing all this.
[22:45:34] Leon Wakefield: I'll check by you later.
[22:45:39] Leon Wakefield: /me turns the frequency to something else.

[22:46:30] Leon Wakefield: You're the.. leader... or something, I presume?
[22:46:34] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: You see i'm the leader of a certain group know as "Shellbeach United" and this base is going to be owned by that group.

[22:47:22] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Are you the current owner of this base?
[22:47:32] Leon Wakefield: No. Theres like 4 other guys, I think.
[22:47:39] Leon Wakefield: I just came here in refuge and somewhere to place this radio.
[22:47:41] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Good to know.
[22:47:53] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: We are NOT taking this by force unless the owners of this group force us to.
[22:48:16] Leon Wakefield: Well, keep me out of that issue. I just want a safe place.
[22:48:30] Leon Wakefield: If you guys are in a conflict, well, I'm on neither side, really.
[22:49:03] Leon Wakefield: /me notices how much static the radio is producing. He toggles off the microphone and the radio, and presses the crude button on the generator.
[22:49:07] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Noted, please explain to the owners that we will be taking this by force at a random time unless they themselves submit to the Shellbeach United group.
[22:49:21] Leon Wakefield: To be honest with ya, I havent even seen the owner.
[22:49:23] Leon Wakefield: Just one of his guys.

[22:55:11] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: We stand for killing the Combine but within reason, not crucifying CP's like certain rebel groups have done before us.
[22:55:28] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: We don't want to look like anarchist now do we?
[22:55:51] Leon Wakefield: Ah, well, we wont have a problem.
[22:56:20] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Good to hear, but be aware that any who want to stop us will be taken down by force.
[22:56:34] Leon Wakefield: Mhm.
[22:56:35] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: We are a large scale group that can't have mercy for every rebel or CP.
[22:56:57] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Pre please lay off of the items until the owners have come to an agreement with us.
[22:57:10] Leon Wakefield: Say, Shellbeach... you guys have a "main base" or something at the err, beach..?
[22:57:20] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Technically yes.
[22:57:30] Leon Wakefield: I've only taken a single step in that area, and I didn't want to continue since I felt like Combine and Antlions would be crawling over the place.
[22:57:30] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: But I wouldn't say it's exactly in the Shellbeach area.
[22:57:46] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: It's mostly quiet except for a few antlions.
[22:57:52] Leon Wakefield: Oh.
[22:57:56] Leon Wakefield: That's good to hear, honestly.
[22:58:11] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: mhm, we are always looking for new members if you wish to join us.

[22:58:34] Leon Wakefield: I only got a rusty shank, too.
[22:58:35] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: That is fine
[22:58:52] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Even those who can't fight can be used for other things.
[22:59:02] Leon Wakefield: I'll consider it, I suppose.
[22:59:08] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Good to know
[22:59:10] Leon Wakefield: I just have some matters I have to go through right now.

[22:59:58] Leon Wakefield: Oh my.
[23:00:02] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Mhm
[23:00:09] Leon Wakefield: That big tank radio over there could be used for listening.
[23:00:27] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Then I hope us and the owners of this base can come to an agreement.
[23:00:41] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: I would rather not have to stomp over any groups.
[23:01:04] Leon Wakefield: Actually, it's sort of.. well... my radio, in a... sense. But you guys can use it, just please don't break it or take it. It's very, very important to me.
[23:01:12] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: We won't.
[23:01:19] Leon Wakefield: I've taken it here in this refuge so its in a safer place.
[23:01:26] Leon Wakefield: It was in an exposed location prior.
[23:01:30] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Got it
[23:01:54] Owen 'Unknown' Clark: Come with me Pre, we will be gaining semi-control over this base until the owners have come to an agreement with us.
