[00:41:20] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm milton you mean the warehouse?

[00:41:34] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm milton I can't say for IC secrecy reasons, but there is a reason

[00:42:25] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm milton OTA don't sleep.
[00:42:44] Milton Dogela: /pm i3 but thats a conscript base
[00:42:53] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm leon I'm not mad, I'm just asking, where'd you get the combat kinfe?
[00:42:58] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm milton joint ota + conscript
[00:43:03] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm milton that's why there's pods
[00:43:11] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm milton and pulse ammo
[00:43:13] Leon Wakefield: /pm grid some guy stored it here and i ever so sneakily traded it for the shiv
[00:43:21] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm leon ah nice
[00:43:24] Leon Wakefield: /pm grid its still here
[00:43:33] Milton Dogela: /pm i3 ah, still. ICCLY ota would constantly patrol this area since there is a known rebel presence. and iccly there is rebels here since i see them fairly commonly
[00:43:48] Milton Dogela: /pm i3 yet i have seen no ota or conscript patrols
[00:43:54] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm milton Who says the rebel presence is known? IC the beach is big, I'm just trying to give a chance to the webuls
[00:43:56] Leon Wakefield: /pm grid btw do the sewing kits contain scissors?
[00:44:11] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm leon I'll say yes, but not like, shears
[00:44:13] Milton Dogela: /pm i3 beach is big, people are obvious though
[00:44:16] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm leon like the lil baby thread scissors
[00:44:30] Leon Wakefield: /pm grid ah ok
[00:44:43] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm milton part of it was i was trying to make searches more infrequent because it's more fair to the rebel aspect
[00:44:56] Milton Dogela: /pm i3 iccly the combine arent fair
[00:45:06] Milton Dogela: /pm i3 thats the whole reason why they exist
[00:45:07] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm milton realistically, in a big ass beach, there would be patrols, but there's only a chance that they would come across the rebel base
[00:45:36] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm milton yeah, i know, and we are tough on rebels, but my point is the beach is relatively small and there's been no reason as of yet to suspect anything
[00:45:36] Milton Dogela: /pm i3 this obvious massive wharehouse, that has direct acess to the outlands to the city
[00:45:41] Leon Wakefield: /me opens the box of sewing supplies and takes out the small thread scissors. He'd gather the scrap cloth on the table along with a shirt, beginning to fashion the cloth into bandages using said scissors.
[00:45:43] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594 cleared decals
[00:46:10] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /pm milton but in a full scale, in something that isn't limited by the number of brushes, there would be several of those types of buildings
[00:46:19] Milton Dogela was killed by npc_antlion
[00:46:38] Milton Dogela: /pm i3 but there is a lot of confusing shit that is ignored iccly, lpike the malnurtrion factor or the aspect that there is constant relocations or the fact that civilans are just beaten down and afraid

[23:37:55] Alexander Boris: Oh sorry, 6th of july.

[23:39:52] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: .//that would make you twenty now, making you seventeen at the time of the 7 hour war, so you'd be in a labor camp IC. Mind if I just bump that year down one?

[23:41:18] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /viewdata alexander
[23:41:44] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: Do you know your blood type?
[23:41:46] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: No is a valid answer.
[23:42:17] Alexander Boris: Uh, in all honesty I never needed to remember it, so no sadly.
[23:42:28] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: No problem.
[23:42:31] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /viewdata alexander
[23:42:44] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: Alright, I'm coming at you with a lot of information, you ready?
[23:43:02] Alexander Boris: .// dude i havent touched hl2rp in years, i forgot how horrifying it is to just be a citizen lmao

[23:43:09] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: .//lmao
[23:43:34] Alexander Boris: .// my interactions may be lacking, but ill try to better that with time hopefully
[23:43:52] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: Okay, so you will need filters to go about your daily life, you can buy them at a shop in the plaza. You can get the money to pay for it from work cycles, ration cycles, blood donation, and resin buybacks, among other things like CWU work or just informal
[23:43:59] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: or just informal work between fellow citizens.
[23:44:22] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: Work cycles are when we call citizens to a warehouse for mandatory labor, rewarded, of course with tokens.
[23:44:40] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: Blood donation is done in machines found across the city, namely in the CWU HQ and the CWU Hospital's lobby.
[23:44:57] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: You'll know them when you see them.
[23:45:52] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: There are pucks of blue metal used in Combine fabrication called resin scattered around the city.
[23:46:11] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: Take them to a Combine terminal in district 2, and you can get tokens for returning them.
[23:46:23] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: There's no penalty in not returning them, but we recommend it because it's a way to get income.
[23:46:31] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: Ration cycles are done en masse, that is, in large groups, regularly.
[23:46:42] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: You will hear an announcement, and you will file down to the Ration Distribution terminal.
[23:46:49] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: Rations include food, water, and tokens.
[23:47:24] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: Some places around the city have air vents installed by the Combine, you'll learn to recognize them eventually. Around them, you can breathe safely and your filter won't be degraded in their vicinity.
[23:47:31] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: /me takes a breath, having just talked a lot.
[23:47:36] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: Do you have any questions?
[23:49:03] Alexander Boris: Not really, you've stated everything clearly and it was good information to know. The only thing left on my mind currently is where I am permitted to move in.
[23:49:33] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: Like for your apartments, I can get you moved in as soon as right now if you like. Apartments are assigned by Civil Protection
[23:49:55] Alexander Boris: If it's not much to ask.
[23:50:00] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: Not at all, it's my job.
[23:50:03] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: Here's your ID.
[23:50:18] Alexander Boris: Thank you.
[23:50:22] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: Proceed to your left and I'll get you an apartment.
[23:50:32] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.26594: Alright, come with me.
