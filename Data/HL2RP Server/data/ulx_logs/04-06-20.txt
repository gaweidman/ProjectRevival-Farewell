[00:03:34] UU-SeC.17: Alright..
[00:03:38] OTA.C17-KING.i3.50919: out of this area
[00:03:39] UU-SeC.17: Overwatch is still a part ofthe combine.
[00:03:47] UU-SeC.17: What you call the Combine is actually the Combine Civil Authority.
[00:04:01] UU-SeC.17: Both overwatch and the metropolice form what is known as the combine.
[00:04:03] UU-SeC.17: For clarification.

[00:06:39] UU-SeC.17: A Judgment Waiver is a state of emergency in which all citizens must go to their place of living.
[00:06:48] UU-SeC.17: While the Combine secures the city.
[00:06:54] UU-SeC.17: Explain to me what Sociocide is.
[00:07:29] UU-SeC.17: You're right, but in the wrong way.
[00:07:48] UU-SeC.17: Sociocide is the intentional disruption of the Combine's peace.
[00:07:56] UU-SeC.17: Be it killing a metropolice unit.
[00:08:04] UU-SeC.17: Or committing arson.
[00:08:15] UU-SeC.17: What is a Sectorial?
[00:08:49] UU-SeC.17: No, it's the Head of the Combine in a certain city.
[00:08:56] UU-SeC.17: The Head of the Metropolice to be exact.
[00:09:01] UU-SeC.17: In a city.
[00:09:04] UU-SeC.17: I'm the 17th sectorial.

[00:09:46] UU-SeC.17: Close.
[00:09:47] UU-SeC.17: He's the leader of the Combine presence on Earth.

[00:23:42] Yuri Romanov: To watch over the Civil Protection and all its parts.
[00:23:55] UU-SeC.17: /pm zach oh yeah. We put combine locks on the inside because that's always in issue. We have non-hidden places  blocked off, but through other means that can easily be unlocked through roleplay
[00:24:07] UU-SeC.17: Not bad. Just basically the metropolice leader of a city.
[00:24:13] UU-SeC.17: Who is The Consul?
