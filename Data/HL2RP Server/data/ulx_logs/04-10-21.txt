[18:04:03] Jason Sheer: You will be god damn Simeon Yeterian
[18:04:25] Jason Sheer: So, you wanna buy?
[18:05:07] Dakota Oswalt: /me takes a moment to reply with anything. "That'd be great but I don't even have 50 credits..."
[18:05:32] Jason Sheer: Damn, really? I have a LOT. I'll barter for it to be 25 and you gotta transport some scrap to me.

[18:09:14] Jason Sheer: /me slides the ID card into my case
[18:10:02] Dakota Oswalt: /me nods, then pushes the door and walks out of the room silently.
[18:10:08] Jason Sheer: Oh and-
[18:10:23] Jason Sheer: To keep you silent- and also because I  have been pushing you wayyy too much.
[18:10:30] Jason Sheer: /me hands him a fake ID card
