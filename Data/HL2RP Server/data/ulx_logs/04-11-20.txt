[23:39:21] Headcrab: /actlean
[23:39:24] Oleg Rust: Whats that?
[23:39:38] Casey Vulchevski: It was a set of arcade games developed by the combine.
[23:39:51] Casey Vulchevski: Their focus was on playing as a manhack
[23:40:08] Casey Vulchevski: You would kill rebels.
[23:40:11] Casey Vulchevski: Sounds kinda fun.
[23:40:15] Casey Vulchevski: Except it turns out.
[23:40:15] Headcrab: /me Hops over to the Terminal.
[23:40:18] Oleg Rust: What is so dangerous?
[23:40:19] Casey Vulchevski: You were controlling manhacks.
[23:40:23] Oleg Rust: Oh
[23:40:23] Casey Vulchevski: Real manhacks.
[23:40:28] Headcrab: /me Tries to consume some of the Metallic Pieces
[23:40:39] Casey Vulchevski: Citizens would be killing other citizens and have no idea.
[23:40:52] Casey Vulchevski: They did a testing run here.
[23:40:52] Headcrab: /looc OOPS
[23:40:58] Headcrab: /looc just d r o p p il l 
[23:40:59] Casey Vulchevski: That's why it's down here and not up there.

[23:41:25] Headcrab: /me Continues his Plans of Trying to consume the metal
[23:41:47] Casey Vulchevski: Nobody knows why.
[23:41:51] Casey Vulchevski: Kind of a mystery.
[23:41:57] Casey Vulchevski: But this place.
[23:42:01] Casey Vulchevski: It haunts me.
[23:42:09] Casey Vulchevski: The level of fucked up it is.
[23:42:19] Casey Vulchevski: It feels different from them killing the children and the disabled.
[23:42:21] Casey Vulchevski: That was outright.
[23:42:29] Casey Vulchevski: But this is.. different.
[23:42:36] Casey Vulchevski: They were coaxing us to attack ourselves.
[23:42:51] Casey Vulchevski: Somehow that felt more twisted.
[23:42:58] Casey Vulchevski: But down here was a testing run.
[23:43:19] Casey Vulchevski: They brought down citizens occasionally and told them to play.
[23:43:22] Casey Vulchevski: They would.
[23:43:26] Casey Vulchevski: Curious, but not caring too much.
[23:43:34] Casey Vulchevski: Then one day it just...
[23:43:35] Casey Vulchevski: Closed.
[23:43:50] Casey Vulchevski: I've tried playing. Maybe I could manage to kill a couple combines.
[23:43:53] Casey Vulchevski: But nope.
[23:43:59] Casey Vulchevski: No signal.
[23:44:13] Casey Vulchevski: All the servers for the games are down.
[23:44:22] Casey Vulchevski: The systems that do work by some miracle just keep trying to connect.
[23:44:37] Oleg Rust: The sound they make is annoying
[23:44:41] Casey Vulchevski: Fucking.
