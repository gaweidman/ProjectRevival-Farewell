[16:19:18] Jay Garret: All owned by you and the CWU?
[16:19:25] Joseph Kimsler: Well, the CWU. I just manage it.
[16:19:44] Joseph Kimsler: I'd don't like to think of myself as an actual powerful individiual. Power is for the strong, like the Combine.
[16:19:45] Jay Garret: Ah, i see.
[16:19:56] Joseph Kimsler: We've got here.
[16:20:03] Joseph Kimsler: Not a bad place.
[16:20:06] Joseph Kimsler: Except for uh.
[16:20:09] Jay Garret: Oh yeah this wouldbe good
[16:20:12] Joseph Kimsler: That's a little... unreliable.
[16:20:15] Joseph Kimsler: Nice overlook.
[16:20:16] Joseph Kimsler: Great place.

[16:22:17] Joseph Kimsler: Is an apartment building.
[16:22:20] Joseph Kimsler: Not great for a server.
[16:22:25] Joseph Kimsler: But.. it's an option I supose.
[16:22:27] Joseph Kimsler: .//suppose*
[16:22:59] Joseph Kimsler: Next up is these apartments.
[16:23:02] Joseph Kimsler: .//which shouldn't locked 
[16:23:19] Joseph Kimsler: It's an apartment.
[16:23:29] Joseph Kimsler: Not the best again, but good to explore our options.
[16:23:33] Joseph Kimsler: We could call that a break room for workers.
[16:23:39] Jay Garret: Yeah
[16:23:45] Joseph Kimsler: .//wtf
[16:23:59] Joseph Kimsler: We've got back here. This area could do. It's a bit out of the way.
[16:24:04] Joseph Kimsler: But it's got an aspect I appreciate.
[16:24:14] Jay Garret: Yeah
[16:24:24] Jay Garret: Its kinda of small too.
[16:24:36] Joseph Kimsler: That too. The server farm is going to be.. sizable as well.
[16:25:35] Joseph Kimsler: This is just an overlook I like.

[16:26:43] Joseph Kimsler: This is mainly used as factory space.
[16:26:47] Joseph Kimsler: My biggest concern is temperature.
[16:26:50] Joseph Kimsler: Server rooms get very warm.
[16:26:59] Joseph Kimsler: The heat from here wouldn't help.
[16:26:59] Jay Garret: True
[16:27:04] Jay Garret: No it wouldnt
[16:27:13] Joseph Kimsler: This isn't much of an option.
[16:27:17] Joseph Kimsler: It's more of a garbage room.
[16:27:21] Joseph Kimsler: /toggleraise
[16:27:23] Joseph Kimsler: Cool room though.
[16:27:24] Joseph Kimsler: /toggleraise

[16:27:49] Joseph Kimsler: /pm judge you'erd being promoted in a few
[16:27:49] Jay Garret: Yeah, Haha.
[16:28:08] Joseph Kimsler: Next up is this.
[16:28:14] Joseph Kimsler: My issue is that it's combine controlled.
[16:28:19] Joseph Kimsler: So only the Combine can get in.
[16:28:25] Joseph Kimsler: But I've seen the inside for some development work.
[16:28:26] Joseph Kimsler: Not awful.
[16:28:46] Joseph Kimsler: .//horrid, do you need any help, bud?
[16:29:45] Jay Garret: This is nice
[16:29:57] Joseph Kimsler: This, again, is an apartment.
[16:30:00] Joseph Kimsler: But we could repurpose it.
[16:30:37] Joseph Kimsler: This is very small.
[16:30:38] Joseph Kimsler: Not ideal.
[16:30:43] Joseph Kimsler: At all.

[16:31:49] Jay Garret: This is nice
[16:31:53] Jay Garret: I like it!
[16:31:53] Joseph Kimsler: Yeah, I'd pick it.
[16:32:37] Jay Garret: /looc This is a pretty lit server
[16:32:43] Joseph Kimsler: .//Thank you! I take pride in it.

[16:33:17] Joseph Kimsler: .//hopefully i will
[16:33:27] Joseph Kimsler: This is a shop space, but once again, repurposing is a possibility.
[16:33:29] Joseph Kimsler: It's unused.
[16:33:34] Joseph Kimsler: The back room is the attraction.
[16:33:40] Jay Garret: Yeah its nice
[16:33:41] Joseph Kimsler: Agh.
[16:33:43] Joseph Kimsler: This cart.
[16:34:08] Joseph Kimsler: This is the laundromat.
[16:34:16] Joseph Kimsler: It wouldn't make the most sense.
[16:34:25] Jay Garret: Yeah, haha.
[16:34:32] Jay Garret: But it smells decent
[16:34:35] Joseph Kimsler: But it's no ta bad space either way.
[16:34:36] Joseph Kimsler: This is true.
[16:34:38] Franz Ferdinand: /actlean
[16:34:45] Joseph Kimsler: Smells like clean linens.
[16:35:56] Joseph Kimsler: Once again here.
[16:36:06] Joseph Kimsler: The B and C apartments would work.
[16:36:13] Joseph Kimsler: Once again, it wouldn't make too much sense.
[16:36:18] Joseph Kimsler: But we could get rid of the living furniture.
[16:36:27] Jay Garret: Oh yeah this could work
[16:36:30] Joseph Kimsler: Yeah, totally.
[16:36:32] Jay Garret: just a little hard work
[16:36:40] Joseph Kimsler: Novv.
[16:36:43] Joseph Kimsler: This is nothing.
[16:36:49] Joseph Kimsler: But I really wish there was a room here.

[22:20:43] Junior Wayne: We are both on the Combine watchlist
[22:20:44] Gabe Hill: Damn, you're right.
[22:20:54] Gabe Hill: Then joining CWU would be your best bet.
[22:21:21] Gabe Hill: You can't mug a CWU for their ID because then they'll talk.
[22:21:21] Junior Wayne: You said that Fransisco guy isn't fan of the combine right
[22:21:56] Junior Wayne: Look man you couldn't trust me but now you do
[22:21:58] Gabe Hill: You know I hear about undercover cops?

[22:22:49] Junior Wayne: Gabe how's life underground?
[22:22:49] Gabe Hill: .//yeah
[22:22:58] Gabe Hill: It's got its ups and downs.
[22:23:13] Gabe Hill: No, I don't mean rogue cops.
[22:23:16] Junior Wayne: You seem to be around a lot.
[22:23:19] Gabe Hill: I mean, like, undercover cops.
[22:23:25] Gabe Hill: The kind that pretend to be civvies.
[22:23:30] Gabe Hill: Then try to join any form of rebellion.
[22:23:32] Gabe Hill: Then bust them.
[22:23:38] Gabe Hill: Damn right you don't. That's the whole point.
[22:23:45] Gabe Hill: You better not.
[22:24:01] Gabe Hill: But, yeah, I'm around a lot.
[22:24:04] Gabe Hill: I watch over a bit.
[22:24:07] Junior Wayne: That guy does not have the undercover cop vibe.
[22:24:31] Gabe Hill: Yeah, that's really sus.
[22:24:33] Gabe Hill: Watch out with him.
[22:24:52] Junior Wayne: Gabe you do know how to get our stuff from that cache spot to a new one thats more secure
[22:24:53] Gabe Hill: But if your cache is down there, you better find a fix soon.
[22:25:07] Gabe Hill: I can get down there myself, but if there's any workers there, it's fucked.
[22:25:21] Junior Wayne: It looked like they were setting up servers
[22:25:31] Gabe Hill: You weren't even there you dumb shit.
[22:25:43] Gabe Hill: It's some CWU thing, but yeah.
[22:26:03] Gabe Hill: I'd give you my ID, but I'm not sure if it'd work. Or if it'd be smart.
[22:26:06] Junior Wayne: Ok look Fransisco has not left the back of the Grotto in hours
[22:26:21] Junior Wayne: I'll be right back
[22:26:36] Gabe Hill: You know I've never seen Francisco or Junior in the same room together?
[22:26:38] Junior Wayne<STEAM_0:0:78553135> changed their name to Francisco Fernández
[22:26:40] Gabe Hill: Weird.
[22:26:56] Gabe Hill: Hold up, Francisco is the dude that owns this place, right?
[22:26:57] Francisco Fernández<STEAM_0:0:78553135> changed their name to Junior Wayne
[22:27:05] Gabe Hill: /w See if you can trust him.
[22:27:14] Gabe Hill: /w If you can, he's important, but make sure he doesn't fuck you.
[22:27:15] Junior Wayne: /actsit

[22:27:23] Junior Wayne: Did he finally come out of that backroom?
[22:27:35] Junior Wayne: So whats the plan now
[22:27:58] Junior Wayne: CWU is to risky for us both
[22:28:27] Junior Wayne: Your the boss
