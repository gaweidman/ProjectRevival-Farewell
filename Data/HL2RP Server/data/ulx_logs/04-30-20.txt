[02:19:00] Ollie Garner: He eventually gave them back... after some threats of reporting him to you. Then Mason comes in, I give him the book to read, and the rest happened.
[02:19:21] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: So Chick didn't grab the papers, have a little chuckle, then give them back, as a joke would normally go.
[02:19:28] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: Would you consider it theft or some sort of malicious act?
[02:19:33] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: Or some joke he took too far?
[02:20:06] Ollie Garner: No. I don't hold a grudge against him for it. May of thought it was funny, but he eventually relented and gave the notepads back.
[02:20:18] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: So it was just a joke taken too far, then.
[02:20:22] Ollie Garner: Yeah.
[02:20:24] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: Alright.
[02:20:49] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: So after the paper incident, he leaves? Then he comes back in, you pick the book back up, and a fight breaks out?
[02:20:56] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: Do I have that righT?
[02:21:14] Ollie Garner: Yes. He most likely came in because of the fact Mason went into my apartment. Mason had consent of course.
[02:21:18] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: Ah.
[02:21:19] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: Alright.
[02:21:49] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: So you have nothing to testify about Chick or Peterson? Positive or negative?
[02:21:55] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: Nothing you can testify for this sentencing?
[02:22:08] Ollie Garner: I do not have anything to testify.
[02:22:12] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: Alright.
[02:22:18] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: Peterson, who started the fight?
[02:22:20] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: Both of you at once?
[02:22:22] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: You?

[02:23:18] Ollie Garner: Oh shit, I think I realize what was happening. Mason might've thought that the CWU took my book.
[02:23:28] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: Mason, did you think that?
[02:23:34] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: Alright.
[02:23:38] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: So that's why you became aggressive.
[02:23:59] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: So is it fair to say you started the book?

[03:34:21] UU-SeC.08: Inference, whatever you want to call it.
[03:34:23] UU-SeC.08: Judgment waiver.
[03:35:01] Mason 'MP5' Peterson: An order where you have to stay inside your house because of anti-citizen activity
[03:35:18] UU-SeC.08: Good. When does one happen normally?
[03:35:25] UU-SeC.08: I guess you sort of said.
[03:35:40] UU-SeC.08: But what is an example of something that would cause a Judgment waiver to be enacted.
[03:36:10] Mason 'MP5' Peterson: A terrorist act by a citizen? Like- A citizen puts bombs on people and hides them around the city?
[03:36:26] UU-SeC.08: That's oddly specific. You planning something you want to tell me about?
[03:36:42] Mason 'MP5' Peterson: What? No- That was just an example, sorry. That does sound weird
[03:36:45] UU-SeC.08: haha
[03:36:48] UU-SeC.08: I'm messing with you.
[03:36:49] UU-SeC.08: But good.
[03:37:00] UU-SeC.08: They go out for large events, not just a singular policide.
[03:37:06] UU-SeC.08: Now if it's multiple policide, that's different.
[03:37:10] UU-SeC.08: Alright.
[03:37:18] UU-SeC.08: sociocide
[03:37:50] Mason 'MP5' Peterson: Uhh- When someone is trying to destroy something? I haven't really heard that term used around here lately
[03:38:38] Mason 'MP5' Peterson: Sorry- that was stupid, I meant- Someone threatening someone elses life- I'm quite nervous
[03:38:51] UU-SeC.08: Understandable.
[03:38:57] UU-SeC.08: The nervousness.
[03:39:16] UU-SeC.08: I'm not going to sugarcoat it. Part of being in the CCA is accepting the fact that things are scary.
[03:39:28] UU-SeC.08: But a member of the CCA would say "Fuck it, I'm going to take it cavalier."
[03:39:46] UU-SeC.08: Got it?
[03:39:53] Mason 'MP5' Peterson: Yeah, got it.

[03:45:20] UU-SeC.08: The City Commander and the Sectorial handle the more military aspects.
[03:45:31] Mason 'MP5' Peterson: Ah, I see. How does the ranking system go?
[03:45:33] UU-SeC.08: Overwatch, CCA, what have you.
[03:45:43] UU-SeC.08: The ranking system as a whole for CCA goes...
[03:45:49] UU-SeC.08: Going from lowest to higherst.
[03:46:00] UU-SeC.08: i5, i4, i3, i2, i1, EpU, OfC, SqL, DvL.
[03:46:13] UU-SeC.08: Elite protection unit, field officer, squad leader, division leader.
[03:46:37] UU-SeC.08: Once you pass DvL, though, you don't belong to a specialty.
[03:46:49] UU-SeC.08: Like GRID, UNION, HELIX, those specialties?
[03:46:55] UU-SeC.08: Those disappear once you get past DvL.
[03:47:03] Mason 'MP5' Peterson: Then- What do you become?
[03:47:03] UU-SeC.08: After that comes CmD and Sectorial.

[03:53:29] Ollie Garner: For me, it has brought some good things. I always have a CP that I can depend on if something happens. I never had too much negatives about the Combine.
[03:53:41] UU-SeC.08: Alright.

[03:54:19] Mason 'MP5' Peterson: /actstand 2
[03:54:42] Ollie Garner: I wish to join the CCA so I can be that CP that I mentioned to someone else. I want to help those in need, and to keep things from ruining what could be a normal life, away from danger.
[03:54:58] UU-SeC.08: Great.
[03:55:15] UU-SeC.08: Now I'm going to say a term.
[03:55:23] UU-SeC.08: You define it to the best of your ability.
[03:55:24] Ollie Garner: /looc Also, sorry if some shit doesn't make sense. A bit tired. Just tell me if it doesn't make sense n shit

[03:57:35] UU-SeC.08: .//shit
[03:57:45] UU-SeC.08: It's any act that does harm to the Combine's society.
[03:57:55] UU-SeC.08: That is, their peace, tranquility, and strength.
[03:58:05] UU-SeC.08: Policide, arson, public disruption.
[03:58:08] UU-SeC.08: All sociocide.
[03:58:17] UU-SeC.08: The first two more than the last, obviously.
[03:58:20] UU-SeC.08: Alright.
[03:58:24] UU-SeC.08: And what is a Sectorial?
[03:58:59] Ollie Garner: I'm guessing it involves sectors? Someone who inspects sectors?
[03:59:12] UU-SeC.08: The highest rank in the CCA. They control a sector.
[03:59:17] UU-SeC.08: Good guess.
[03:59:43] UU-SeC.08: They're one of the highest ranks on Earth, reporting only to the Earth Administrator.
[03:59:52] UU-SeC.08: And who is the Consul?
[03:59:54] UU-SeC.08: Not his name.
[04:00:01] UU-SeC.08: But his title, and what  he does.
[04:00:37] Ollie Garner: The Consul governs this city. He makes sure everything is in order and is going as planned. I think.
[04:00:55] UU-SeC.08: No, that would be the City Administrator.
[04:00:58] Ollie Garner: /looc fuck bumped into my mouse
[04:01:01] UU-SeC.08: The Consul is Earth Administrator.
[04:01:11] UU-SeC.08: He's the head of the Combine's presence on Earth.
