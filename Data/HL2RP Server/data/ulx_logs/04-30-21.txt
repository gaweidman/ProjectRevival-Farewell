[21:18:20] Geophrey T. Guard the Guard to admins: we're going to the cum zone
[21:18:21] Cave Johnson: We came here to find the old Aperture time machine.
[21:18:36] Cave Johnson: The reason the Combine had the time machine is because I told them that Aperture made one, all the way back in the sixties.
[21:18:47] Michael J. Samson: well, do you know where were going?
[21:19:08] Cave Johnson: /me takes a sharp, annoyed inhale.
[21:19:11] Cave Johnson: Yes, Michael.
[21:19:14] Cave Johnson: We are going to the time machine.
[21:19:16] Cave Johnson: The aperture time machine.
[21:19:19] Cave Johnson: That is why we came here.
[21:19:24] Cave Johnson: It is in the lower levels of the facility.

[21:19:48] Michael J. Samson: // also i effectivly asked "where are we going"
[21:20:09] Cave Johnson: So we're going to the lower levels of the facility. From here, there should be an indirect way to get down, if not a direct way.
[21:20:09] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: So, you sayin' we should take the time machine?
[21:20:10] Michael J. Samson: // anyways back to rp
[21:20:19] Cave Johnson: ...YEs.
[21:20:24] Cave Johnson: ..We should take the time machine.
[21:20:35] Michael J. Samson: alright guys, shut up, let the man talk
[21:20:37] Cave Johnson: That way we can get out of here, and back to our time.
[21:20:49] Cave Johnson: Have I made enough sense, or do I need to get out the picture books?
[21:20:55] Dustin Rory: .// YES
[21:20:56] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: And if we get ripped to shreds in the process from space ripping apart?

[21:21:27] Cave Johnson: Alright, covert.
[21:21:43] Cave Johnson: We don't want to be spotted. We need to find some kind of staff supply closet or storage, where we can get lab coats.
[21:21:49] Cave Johnson: Or, anything else to make us not look so out of place.
[21:21:53] Cave Johnson: Guard uniforms, anything
[21:21:54] Cave Johnson: Okay?

[21:50:03] Dr. Miranda Bhatti: and yes, I am a doctor
[21:50:10] Michael J. Samson: bitch don't fucking get me started
[21:50:15] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: Doesn't make sense.

[22:32:08] Cave Johnson: I would imagine before the water got in.
[22:32:19] Cave Johnson: //Hey, welcome! You came in at a really weird time because of the event!
[22:32:27] Frank C.: hi
[22:32:32] Cave Johnson: We've got...
[22:32:33] Cave Johnson: hm
[22:32:35] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: i'll get them
[22:32:44] Dustin Rory: .// cragle
[22:32:51] Cave Johnson: .//bad time for new player
[22:32:54] Frank C.: So what do it do?
[22:32:55] Cave Johnson: I wonder if the one below was flooded.
[22:32:55] Dustin Rory: .// true
[22:33:07] Cave Johnson: If this is where I think it is, there's a slight chance of...
[22:33:09] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: /y Hey!
[22:33:09] Cave Johnson: No, no way.
[22:33:14] Dustin Rory: Whats up?
[22:33:24] Cave Johnson: Well, we used to have this device.
[22:33:49] Cave Johnson: We used it a lot in testing. Especially in the areas near the time machine.
[22:34:04] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: he found his own way here
[22:34:20] Cave Johnson: If this is where I think it is, we *may* be near an older-style Aperture Science Handheld Quantum Tunneling Device.
[22:34:23] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: what are you doing?
[22:34:27] Michael J. Samson: // hes fucking clueless as to whats happening
[22:34:40] Frank C.: Hell yeah i am clueless
[22:34:41] Cave Johnson: //i don't even know hwo to get a new player up to speed here
[22:34:43] Cave Johnson: //like
[22:34:49] Dustin Rory: Then lets get to it.
[22:34:51] Cave Johnson: //holy shit everything about this is insane without experiencing it
[22:34:54] Cave Johnson: It's a maybe.
[22:35:09] Cave Johnson: But if there's an enrichment sphere down here, there may be an, uh...
[22:35:11] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: // basically, time travel

[22:36:02] Cave Johnson: Yeah, the ASHQTD
[22:36:09] Cave Johnson: No, I'm figuring out the acronym.
[22:36:15] Dustin Rory: Aperture isn't very good at making acronyms.
[22:36:20] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: i can see that
[22:36:25] Cave Johnson: I think we had a better name for it but I can't think of it.

[22:40:39] Frank C.: //Everybody is invisable
[22:40:46] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: The most notable thing I can remember is falling off the roof by NOMAD
