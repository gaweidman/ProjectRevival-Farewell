[02:58:04] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Yes.
[02:58:10] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Alright.

[02:58:39] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Alright.
[02:59:11] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: So our ranking system is pretty standard to what you'd see in any other city. We've got i5, i4, i3, i2, i1, EpU, OfC, SqL, and DvL.
[02:59:18] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: After that comes CmD and SeC.
[02:59:26] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: .//i forgot how to train people am i retarded
[02:59:33] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: We've got the standard four divisions.
[02:59:34] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Tis good. 
[02:59:39] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: GRID, HELIX, UNION, and JUDGE.
[02:59:48] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: I know some cities name it JURY, but here we call it JUDGE.
[03:00:06] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: When you first get in you'll start out as a UNION i5.
[03:00:38] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: In order to get into GRID or HELIX, you'll have to earn a certification based off of your engineering or medical skill respectively.
[03:01:40] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: We provide materials to learn with. Most of them are pre-war textbooks that you're free to use as long as we get them back.
[03:02:56] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: And when you're 10-7 you're free to shadow a 10-8 GRID or HELIX unit with their permission to learn.
[03:03:04] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: In fact we highly recommend that.
[03:03:13] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Alright.
[03:03:35] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: In order to get into JUDGE, you have to be specially selected.
[03:04:58] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: In order to be selected, you have to show extraordinary questioning and sentencing talent.
[03:05:10] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Just general duties a JUDGE unit would be good at.
[03:05:16] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: That sort of thing.
[03:05:20] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: I see.
[03:05:37] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Our loadout rules are strict, but they're well-defined.
[03:05:42] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: i5 and i4 you get your USP Match.
[03:05:58] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: i3 and i2 you get your MP7.
[03:06:34] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: i1 you get the MP7 grenade and the shotgun. You can use either the MP7 or Shotgun, your choice.
[03:06:44] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: The SPAS-12, to be specific, not the SG1.
[03:06:53] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Alright.
[03:07:08] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: EpU and above gets the .357 Magnum.
[03:08:17] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Then once you get to OfC and you're at SqL you get the Objective Individual Combat Weapon.
[03:08:44] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: That sounds terrifying.
[03:08:46] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Division leaders of course get the AR2 pulse rifle.
[03:08:52] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: It's actually not too fearsome.
[03:09:05] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: I've been trying to push for a change to swap the SPAS-12 and the OICW.
[03:09:23] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Not sure if any of my higher ups will care enough to change it.
[03:09:27] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: The OICW isn't too fearsome.
[03:09:34] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: But it is still... we'll say experimental.
[03:09:40] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Huh...
[03:10:20] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: It's just a glorified SMG that fires fletchettes.
[03:10:26] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: You ever seen a fletchette?
[03:10:38] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: No. Never even heard of them.

[03:10:55] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Is good.

[03:12:50] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Oh... that's... pretty damn weird looking.
[03:13:03] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Yeah, but once you see them in action you get why the look like that real quickly.
[03:13:17] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Normally we have our synths use them, but someone had the idea of putting them on the OICW, so here we are.
[03:13:23] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Oh god. I can already imagine how bad this stuff would hurt.
[03:13:37] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: You're still missing the fun part. You see that blue LED on top?
[03:13:42] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Yeah.

[03:15:06] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: The primary fire is just SMG fire.

[03:17:02] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Yeah, it's all good.
[03:17:15] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: So it fires with an accuracy between an MP7 and an AR2.
[03:17:22] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Pretty standard, but shoots AR2 type rounds.

[03:18:15] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: They're powerful buggers.
[03:18:33] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Yeah... god I hoped I don't get shot by accident with one of those. I like my flesh where it is.
[03:18:43] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Yeah, they're something.,
[03:18:45] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc *hope
[03:18:53] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Central science does some good work.
[03:19:03] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Yeah, goddamn. 
[03:19:10] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: The issue with it now is that you can shoot.. relatively unlimited flechettes.
[03:19:24] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Are you familiar with how hunter-chopper explosives work?
[03:19:37] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: I think so? No, probably not.
[03:19:51] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Well ,they're these big balls. Probably about the diameter of this OICW.
[03:19:53] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: /toggleraise
[03:19:58] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: /toggleraise
[03:20:01] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Yikes.
[03:20:19] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: But they fit into Hunter-Choppers really easily, despite being wider than the helicopter itself.
[03:20:31] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: They do it by making them collapsible.

[03:21:11] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Really? I see. Wait, collaspible? Wouldn't that cause a... chemical reaction? Y'know what, I'm gonna stop quesitoning UU tech.
[03:21:33] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: No, not in the explosives. They're actually mostly empty space.
[03:21:39] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: The only reason they collapse is because they're contact mines.
[03:21:45] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Or expand, rather.
[03:21:50] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: So they go off if you touch them.
[03:22:01] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Oh, damn.
[03:22:04] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: So obviously if they were small, they would be less effective.
[03:22:12] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: The hunter-chopper explosives are mostly empty space.
[03:22:19] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Alright.
[03:22:25] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: I'm going off on a tangent.
[03:22:50] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: But basically, the flechettes are stored similarly. They're actually little flat disks that pop out and are charged in the barrel.
[03:23:06] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Huh, neat.
[03:23:26] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: The issue is there's no regulation in the current model on how fast the flechettes are charged or fired.
[03:23:40] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: So the gun will go into overdrive trying to charge all of them so quickly.
[03:23:53] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: It causes overheating, followed by just general damage you don't want in a firearm of all things.
[03:24:05] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: So it's not exactly widely liked by the union.
[03:24:20] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Oh god. I wouldn't be surprised if those things... explode with all those things in them.
[03:24:32] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Yeah. Thankfully they don't because they're uncharged until right before firing.
[03:24:48] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: But still, it's a damage of property, which is a loss, meaning we lose resources to go to other more important things.
[03:24:51] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Unnecessary loss.
[03:24:55] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Okay, where the hell were we?
[03:25:06] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Right. You get your AR2 at DvL.
[03:25:08] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Uh, last thing I remember was loadout shit
[03:25:17] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Right, right right.
[03:25:50] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: That's really it. Overwatch soldiers get more esoteric weapons.
[03:25:55] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Maybe esoteric isn't the right word, but.
[03:25:59] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: It's some weird stuff.
[03:26:07] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: The SG1, the HMG1.
[03:26:10] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: All that good stuff.
[03:26:22] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Yeah. I saw one of those white armored guys with some fuckin... electrical rifle thingy.
[03:26:42] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Oh, right, I forgot you don't know about Combine tech.
[03:26:53] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: So the Union has developed some weapons of its own.
[03:26:56] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Firearms, that is. Obviously.
[03:27:23] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Our creations include the SG1, Overwatch Pulse Scattergun I believe is the name they gave it.
[03:27:46] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: There's the suppression issue rifle which is basically an LMG in the body of another rifle we produce.
[03:27:55] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: It's our staple, I've mentioned it before, the AR2.
[03:28:20] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Ah. Must be what I see those soldiers use often. At least that's what I saw back in C17.
[03:28:34] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Yeah. That and the MP7, you'll see transhuman arm using those a lot.
[03:28:57] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: The AR2, to the layman, is basically a cooler-looking assault rifle.
[03:29:03] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Transhuman? That's a first time I heard that term.
[03:29:13] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Oh, yes, the transhuman arm.
[03:29:27] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: So the soldiers we have for more advanced situations.
[03:29:43] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: They have the helmets different as ours. Glowing eyes always, normally wider helmets.
[03:29:48] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Sometimes they're cyclops helmets.
[03:29:51] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: You know the ones.
[03:30:05] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Yeah. White armored guys. How the hell do they see through those?
[03:30:14] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Actually, really well
[03:30:43] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: The cyclops visor is capable of visualizing things the human eye can't see.
[03:30:50] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Huh...
[03:30:50] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Those soldiers undergo so much physical augmentation they're considered Transhuman by the union.
[03:30:56] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Personally, they're just as human as anyone else.
[03:31:01] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: But with a bit of robot parts.
[03:31:05] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Goddamn.
[03:31:16] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: You can still have a conversation with one, they're alright.
[03:31:22] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Sounds... painful.
[03:31:24] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: The higher ranking ones and the more elite ones probably won't.
[03:31:32] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: No, no, it's fine. They're unconscious the entire time.
[03:31:45] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Plus they're on a hell of a lot of morphine and painkillers when they get out of it.
[03:31:48] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: .//haha lying is fun
[03:32:06] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: God, I hope so. 
[03:32:12] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: .//painkillers are for the weak
[03:32:17] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: .// - wallace breen
[03:32:43] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: But, yeah. Those guys are a whole other force, the Overwatch.
[03:33:36] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: That includes our synths, that's the nonhuman things we have in our forces. Striders, gunships, dropships, cremators, all them.
[03:34:05] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: It also includes the transhuman arm. They're who fight actual battles and such.
[03:34:07] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Shit. Explains the fuckin... just breathing the Cremators have. I opened a door to one of them once. Never again...
[03:34:49] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Yeah, they're something else.
[03:34:55] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Personally I think they're a damn miracle.
[03:35:09] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: But I can see why they'd be offputting to a new non-citizen.
[03:35:29] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Yeah... they'll probably take some getting used too for me.
[03:35:37] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Yeah, I don't blame you.
[03:35:45] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Shit, right. Divisions.
[03:35:59] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: GRID units get to pilot scanners manually.
[03:36:11] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Not to say that all scanners are piloted by metropolice. Most of them aren't.
[03:36:25] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: But if need be, they're free to pilot them at any time given they're not patrolling or doing anything else.
[03:36:47] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: They do anything from engineering, to R&D, to repair.
[03:37:15] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: This city must be built on GRIDs then. So much fuckin electronics in just one area...
[03:37:16] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: When you're in the lower ranks you'll mostly do shit like fixing cameras, buffing out the APCs, all that.
[03:37:22] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Yeah, it's pretty nice.
[03:37:24] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: .//SHIT I'M STILL C17

[03:38:12] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Funny you should say that. Most cities have that same level of involvement, just usually in places you wouldn't think.
[03:38:31] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Any time a fence is cut, a GRID unit is the one to patch it up.
[03:38:47] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Or a Civil Worker.
[03:38:49] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Huh. Maybe I just never saw it. I lived in the industral area of C17. So I was usually just in my apartment.
[03:39:12] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Yeah, that's where I was transferred in from. Fuckin' loved that place.
[03:39:43] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: But, yeah. Once you get to the higher ranks, probably i1, EpU, and OfC, you get involved with Central Science.
[03:39:48] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: That's the nickname I've given them
[03:39:55] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: They're the union's R&D department.
[03:40:03] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Except it's ALL research.
[03:40:06] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: All the cutting edge stuff.
[03:40:14] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: HELIX units are pretty standard at first.
[03:40:31] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Trip and fall, put a little band-aid on it, get a kiss on the wound, back on patrol.
[03:40:46] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: There's actually quite a deficit of HELIX units.
[03:40:59] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Not enough people with medical backgrounds join the CCA.
[03:41:01] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Pretty sad, honestly.
[03:41:19] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Huh. I might check some books out at some point then. See if I got what it takes.
[03:41:20] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: So due to that, responsibilities as an i5, even, are pretty ramped up.
[03:41:33] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Good idea. We could always use another HELIX.
[03:41:48] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: I'd ask if you mind the sight of blood, but knowing the force you joined, I'm sure I have the answer.
[03:41:49] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: haha
[03:42:09] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: By i4, you'll probably be doing body part transplants.
[03:42:23] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Yeah. I mean, when I was a civi, I was kinda pissed that a fight broke out in my apartment and there was blood on the wall.
[03:42:43] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Damn, must have been a bad fight.
[03:42:47] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Takes a lot of force to get it on the wall.
[03:42:53] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Just a fuckin fist fight.
[03:42:57] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Damn.
[03:43:14] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: I'd try to get the bastard who fought into the force, that's some good strength.
[03:43:31] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: At least there was one of those uh, GRID units nearby at the time. Actually, he joined up with me. Went by the name of Mason.
[03:43:41] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Oh really? Good to know.
[03:43:45] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: He'd make a good JUDGE, I'll bet.
[03:43:52] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Our numbers ended up being similar in two places. Was pretty fuckin weird.
[03:43:57] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Hell, maybe he'll get transferred to overwatch.
[03:43:59] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Oh, wow.
[03:44:03] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//damn right babey
[03:44:11] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: What a coincidence.
[03:44:20] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: If I believed in fate, I'd say you two were destined to join together.
[03:44:23] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: But fate's a crock.
[03:44:54] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Yeah. Maybe. I hate the idea of being destined to fail. Paving a path yourself was the sort of inspiration I like to use.
[03:45:20] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Eh, doesn't matter. I'm just here to fix the world, not worry about smoke and mirrors in the sky.
[03:45:23] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Anyways, like in GRID, you get into way different stuff around i1, EpU, and OfC in HELIX.
[03:45:36] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Around those ranks you very well could be working with synths.
[03:45:52] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: As well as other biological research.
[03:46:12] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: You can also be transferred into Central Science from HELIX, but for different fields of study obviously.
[03:46:21] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Ooh. Sounds fun.
[03:46:44] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Now I am very tempted to have this character, at later parts, end up in a similar state to the TF2 Medic holy fuck
[03:46:50] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Yeah. I'd love to mix the two together. High GRID and high HELIX.

[03:50:24] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//and i fucking love cremators
[03:50:45] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Indeed. I kinda love the idea they might be "outdated" in a way. Fuckin scary to think what could be a new cremator
[03:51:19] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//holy shit what if they changed the beta concept to spray out, instead of a corrosive beam or whatever the shit
[03:51:26] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//it's like the microHID from secret lab
[03:51:29] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//but with combine dark energy
[03:51:35] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Oh god. 
[03:51:44] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//like it sprays out Combine energy ball shit
[03:51:51] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//valve, make it, please.
[03:51:53] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc You can fuckin spray in this gamemode?
[03:52:00] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//unfortunately.
[03:52:00] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: /doorsethidden true
[03:52:04] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Legit caught me off fuckin guard holy shit
[03:52:08] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//i *THOUGHT* i fxied it
[03:52:12] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//but no i didn't
[03:52:18] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//i do it accidentally so much
[03:52:29] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//but i have sprays disabled for whatever reason so i have no clue where sprays are
[03:52:38] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//i could walk past goatse on a daily basis and have no clue
[03:52:56] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Oof. Maybe see if you can restrict it to civis in a way. So they can make rebel insignias or some shit
[03:53:01] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//yeah
[03:53:11] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: //i know in clockwork you could only use sprays if you had the spray can item
[03:53:17] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: //that or that was a plugin or something
[03:53:21] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//either way, cool idea
[03:53:21] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: // Huh.
[03:53:34] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//i've always wanted an item where you could custom write your own text wtih spray paint
[03:53:37] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//like on walls
[03:53:50] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//that gets saved past restarts
[03:53:55] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Yeah. I know there is a mod for a spraycan I see sometimes used on RP servers.
[03:53:59] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//i'm sure it's beyond possible but i'm not good enough at programming
[03:54:03] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Or well addon.
[03:54:10] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//OH YEAH there is a spray can addon isn't there
[03:54:46] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Yeah. hell, you can probably use WIRE mod for that shit. In Impulse, people made a Lambda Symbol using the sign shit
[03:55:01] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//i wish wiremod was able to be saved between restarts
[03:55:07] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//we could do such cool shit with it
[03:55:09] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Oof.
[03:55:16] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//maybe it is and i'm just fucking stupid
[03:55:21] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//there's a very good chance that's true
[03:55:28] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Adv Dupe 2 does exist for a reason tho!
[03:55:30] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//but genuinely we could do some really cool shit with it
[03:55:32] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//true, true
[03:55:56] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//anyways back to IC
[03:56:00] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Yee
[03:56:10] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Yeah.
[03:56:19] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: JUDGE has a lot of misconceptions.
[03:56:51] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: So some people think that since JUDGE focuses on sentencing and all that, that they are the only ones who can sentence, deliver verdicts, do interrogations, monitor detainments, et cetera.
[03:57:00] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: That is very much not the case.
[03:57:51] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: It's highly encouraged that JUDGE units are called in to do such things, but for small violations, it doesn't matter.
[03:58:26] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: // F
[03:58:36] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: If there are no JUDGE units 10-8 when something goes down, any division can do it.
[03:58:57] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: But it's highly preferred that JUDGE units do so. They're specially chosen and then trained, so they know what they're doing.
[03:59:17] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Alright.
[03:59:30] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Then UNION is UNION.
[03:59:33] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: The forgotten one.
[03:59:47] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: It's your standard patrol unit.
[04:00:08] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Quick sidenote, all divisions patrol, it's just that UNION doesn't have any specialty, so it's known as "the patrol unit."
[04:00:32] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Ah. I'm guessing that's where most of the new units are in. Including me.
[04:00:51] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Yes, that's where all of the new units go. Some choose to stay in UNION, some get chosen for JUDGE.
[04:00:55] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: All depends on what they want.
[04:01:10] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: You're going to spend a bit of time in UNION before you get into another division if you so choose.
[04:01:19] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Oh god. If a HELIX and a JUDGE got partnered together...
[04:01:25] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: I see.
[04:01:31] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//they could some fucked up shit
[04:01:49] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//torture them precisely for maximum pain and ensure they torture them within a hair of their life.
[04:02:00] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Some cities do elite divisions for their CCA.
[04:02:02] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: We don't.
[04:02:11] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: That could change, but at the moment, that's not a thing we do here.
[04:02:17] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Alright.
[04:02:27] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//out of character, we would do that but our playerbase is way too fucking small
[04:02:34] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Yeah.
[04:02:39] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//we hardly have high ranking metropolice
[04:02:42] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//if we grow to like
[04:02:43] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//way bigger
[04:02:47] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//we'd totally include it
[04:02:56] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Oof. Quesition, how many HELIXs are there? Active ones, I mean.
[04:03:00] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//Uh.
[04:03:04] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//One.
[04:03:09] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//And that's semi-active.
[04:03:11] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc I don't think I EVER seen a HELIX on here.
[04:03:21] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc oof.
[04:03:25] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//the player who uses it is active, but he hasn't gotten on his HELIX in a while
[04:03:32] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//before the map change he used it a lot
[04:03:39] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//then the whole rebellion thing happened
[04:03:44] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//and we're still working on encouraging cityRP
[04:03:44] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: /doorsethidden true
[04:03:50] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//that reminds me, i owe his HELIX a promotion to i4
[04:04:02] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Ah. I see. Personally, I'm going to try my best on halfing my time as a Rebel and halfing my time as a CP
[04:04:08] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//that's good
[04:04:16] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//that's what we want from our rebels
[04:04:24] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//understanding of the need for BALANCE
[04:04:33] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Like, if there's only one or two rebels on, I'm goin CP for sure
[04:04:41] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//yeah, totally
[04:05:05] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//shit i had something kind of important
[04:05:11] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Oh, yikes.
[04:05:21] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//eh whatever. if it's important it'll come back to me
[04:05:27] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Aight
[04:05:42] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//I REMEMBER
[04:05:47] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: So, let's talk memory replacement.
[04:05:55] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Did the commander already talk to you about it.
[04:05:58] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//it?*
[04:06:32] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Alright. No, not at all. Honestly, I wasn't told much by him. I think I blacked out for a bit then sorta woke up when you came along.
[04:06:41] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Alright.
[04:06:41] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: So.
[04:06:57] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Memory replacement, have you heard anything about it?
[04:07:19] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: No. Except in the top left of my left eye. I noticed some weird text occasionally refrence it.
[04:07:48] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: So, it's sometimes a bit of a weird topic to talk about.
[04:07:52] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Kinda scares the recruits.
[04:07:57] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: But essentially, here's how it works.
[04:08:01] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: It's a medical procedure.
[04:08:08] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//damn daniel already starting off with those lies
[04:08:20] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Alright.
[04:09:04] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: We remove various connections in your memory centers, all psychologically, not surgically, to anything that's linked to fear, pain, suffering, all that.
[04:09:20] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /me would nod a bit, listening.
[04:09:23] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: As well as things like pre-war attachment and a bit of that instinct The Consul talks about.
[04:09:41] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: It enhances field performance, we've done studies, it's very effective.
[04:09:59] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//literally one word in that entire explanation was true
[04:10:03] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//maybe two
[04:10:25] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Huh. Honestly, I never considered myself to of lived quite the fullest life I would like to remember.
[04:10:47] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: I mean, fuckin main reason I joined up in the first place. I actually get to well, live and do shit. 
[04:10:57] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Maybe not, but according to Central Science, the brain can harbor some stuff behind the curtain you don't know affects you.
[04:11:15] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: So when you're in here, that doesn't get in the way.
[04:11:22] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Alright.
[04:11:23] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: It has advantages other than that.
[04:11:30] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: We require it upon promotion to i2.
[04:12:12] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: But you can also receive it directly after training and receive faster promotions than a fresh i5 who didn't receive memory replacement.
[04:12:18] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//so basically it's a tradeoff
[04:12:27] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//either you have the option to go rogue but you get promoted slower
[04:12:36] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//or you can't go rogue but you get promotions faster
[04:13:06] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: I see. Hey uh, question before we contiune. Been sort of in the edge of my mind. What happened during the surgery I got or whatever? I think it was one of the reasons I blacked out during training.
[04:13:37] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Some GRID I think was surprised that I was awake when I got out of surgery.
[04:13:57] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Surgery? Which- Oh, you mean the biosignal implant, don't you?
[04:14:08] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Where you wake up and you can open combine doors and locks and all that?
[04:14:44] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Which...? I'm not even going to ask, but yeah. It might've been that. I dunno. I was told it went very... messy.
[04:15:32] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: I wouldn't know. I don't ever get involved in medical stuff unless it's a broken machine. It must not have been anything too bad if there hasn't been talk about it.
[04:15:41] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Yeah, I guess.
[04:15:52] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Anyways, sorry for putting us off track.
[04:16:32] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: From what I understand the operation isn't invasive or dangerous. It's just a little chip in  your back like a dog pre-war that can transfer information with your suit.
[04:16:42] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: It's alright, I understand your concern.
[04:16:55] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Yeah. Good to know.
[04:17:41] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Alright, is there anything you have to ask me at the moment?>
[04:17:48] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: No, not really.
[04:18:36] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Great. The last thing is the more boring part.
[04:18:43] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: It's just our list of offenses.
[04:18:54] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: Fun.
[04:18:57] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: I can give it transmitted to your suit if it's not already there.
[04:19:09] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: I'd rather put my head in a woodchipper than read all of it off to you.
[04:19:16] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: So this makes it a lot better for both of us.
[04:19:24] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: I think the guy who was training me previously already did that. 
[04:19:32] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Ah, great.
[04:19:34] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc I am assuming you talkin bout the doc
[04:19:41] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//yeah, the guide
[04:19:45] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Yee
[04:19:49] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//yeah
[04:20:14] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//obviously that's not our bible because we let citizens swear and apply to the CWU and get into the CCA sans loyalist points, all that stuff
[04:20:24] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//but we go off of the offense and punishment list
[04:20:26] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//and the radio codes
[04:20:33] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//that's really all you need to know there
[04:20:39] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Yeah. I kinda thought it would be shitty-ish to not let em curse.
[04:20:47] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: watch your mouth
[04:20:55] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: watch your mouth
[04:21:10] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Towards a officer is the only time I would probably enforce it. At least if used aggresively
[04:21:27] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//yeah, but at that point you could consider it harassment of an officer anyways
[04:21:49] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Yeah
[04:22:14] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//uh one more thing
[04:22:26] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//you're with it so i shouldn't need to mention this
[04:22:28] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//but just in case i do
[04:22:34] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//autonomous judgment here
[04:22:37] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//does not mean deploying OTA
[04:22:44] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//it means killing all the citizens
[04:22:50] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Alright
[04:22:56] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//i know some servers have done that
[04:23:03] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//where it means deploying OTA
[04:23:05] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//but not here
[04:23:22] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Yeah. Tbf, this is the first serious HL2RP I actually got into
[04:23:32] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc So I don't have much to go off of
[04:23:36] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//ah, alright
[04:23:43] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//well another disclaimer then
[04:23:53] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//some servers will call JW every time a unit dies
[04:23:57] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//but that's not what we do
[04:24:04] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Ah. Do you do reasons?
[04:24:12] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//reasons?
[04:24:16] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc I know Impulse does it with reasons. Need three reasons
[04:24:21] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//oh that's fair
[04:24:23] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//three reasons
[04:24:28] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Four dead CPs count as a reason, a dead OTA is a reason, etc etc
[04:24:47] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//it's really just kinda handled by how HC feels about it. If there are a lot of CPs dying, or like, two OfCs are assassinated
[04:24:49] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//that sort of tihng
[04:24:50] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Basically signs of a possible uprising.
[04:24:53] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//yeah
[04:25:06] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//we don't call JW every time a unit is killed, unless it's like, either multiple policide or like a pretty high ranking unit dying
[04:25:13] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//normally it's just unrest procedure
[04:25:28] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc I'm guessing it is called in if a big ass rebel base is found? Since that's what it seemed like during my first JW in the server
[04:25:59] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//i wouldn't consider that a reason to call one as long as the situation is under control
[04:26:07] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Ah.
[04:26:16] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//but if the base evacuates and the combine finds out they evacuated, or they lose control of the situation somehow
[04:26:26] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//then it'd be JW or unrest
[04:26:29] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//andif they fight back
[04:26:31] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Ah, aight.

[04:30:02] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc What will qualify as a PK? 
[04:30:19] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//to be honest, it's a pretty blurred line. it's declared by staff on a case by case basis
[04:30:30] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//NPC-based deaths are almost never PK
[04:30:49] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Okay. So, let's say I get killed by a rebel player during a JW or something, will that count as a PK?
[04:31:00] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//no
[04:31:12] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//until you get to a significant rank

[04:31:19] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Okay. 
[04:31:28] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//like if the DvL dies, it's a PK
[04:31:45] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc If you get PKed, will you have to go through in char apps again?
[04:31:47] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//but if an i5-i1 gets killed, it's fine because they're disposable and shouldn't really fear for their life

[04:32:10] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//the only way you have to go through apps again is by getting dewhitelisted entirely
[04:32:13] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Nice. I'm guessing you'll be back at i5 or some shit
[04:32:16] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//yep
[04:32:20] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Oof.
[04:32:34] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//if we're real assholes we'd make them attend training again
[04:32:52] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//as unfair as it is to rebels, we have this sort of combine death dominance policy
[04:33:03] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//where metropolice are trained to believe and know they're disposable
[04:33:10] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//so they go into combat fearless
[04:33:33] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//thus when they die, it's not surprising. But if every death for combine is a PK, they won't be fearless or act like they know they're disposable
[04:33:42] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Alright. Are OTAs similar? Just asking incase if this character ever becomes a OTA.
[04:34:19] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//OTAs are similar. I cannot think of an instance where an OTA would be PKed.
[04:34:32] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//but keep in mind there can always be exceptions that come up
[04:34:43] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//there could be some circumstance where an i4 gets PKed or an OTA does
[04:34:44] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: /doorsethidden true
[04:34:46] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//just depends
[04:34:52] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//but 99% of the time that's how it'll go
[04:34:54] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Okay. I always kinda hoped that. Since OTAs are supposed to essentially be the "same" character every time.
[04:34:59] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//yeah
[04:35:06] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//we do OTA a bit differently than most servers

[04:35:25] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Yeah.
[04:35:33] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//because some of the voicelines in alyx and the fact that they yell "Shit!" when you throw a grenade into a sniper den
[04:35:53] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//not that we allow them to be buddy buddy, but they can have at least a bit of a personality.
[04:36:03] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc I won't ever play them like fuckin... humans. They'll maybe show a tiny bit of emotion during a small panic or just fuckin around with a CP, but that's about it.
[04:36:36] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: Yeah. If I imagine an OTA showing emotion, it's a stereotypical fuckin vietnam soldier
[04:36:41] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//shit, LOOC that
[04:36:51] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//where it's like "ah shit, there's a gun to my head"

[04:37:03] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//that kind of thing
[04:37:31] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Oof. Also, ngl, I think it's kinda dumb when people say that the soldiers are saying Sorry to Alyx. I always imagined it was them saying Sorry to Overwatch or some shit. Showing how brainwashed they are.
[04:37:50] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.04182: .//saying sorry to alyx? i assume that's some HL:Alyx shit i don't know about

[04:38:27] CCA.C08-RCT.33698: /looc Same.

[19:41:21] Mitchell Lazarus: // Or let a Combine Soldier punch you into the ground.
[19:41:30] UU-CmD.08: advanced firing line is a line of crouching units in front, and standing in the back, all weapons drawn.
[19:41:41] CCA.C08-RCT.19691: That's what I was thinking of
[19:42:00] UU-CmD.08: prisoner diamond is 4 units on either direction on a prisoner, facing inwards with weapons drawn.

[19:42:59] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.29409: True.
[19:43:03] CCA.C08-RCT.19691: Just like an arrow sign, kind of.
[19:43:17] UU-CmD.08: i suppose, yeah
[19:43:18] CCA.C08.UNION-i5.33698: Well, I guess let's go and report the new arrivals to the CMD.
