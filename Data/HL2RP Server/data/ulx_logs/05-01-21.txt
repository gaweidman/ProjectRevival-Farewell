[02:40:43] Cave Johnson: To this new mixed up universe.
[02:40:48] Price Broadbent: Why?
[02:40:54] Cave Johnson: Ten years in here, you learn a lot.
[02:41:07] Cave Johnson: You learn to do a lot, and you learn a lot about the world and yourself.
[02:41:14] Cave Johnson: Seeing some key moments throughout history teaches you.
[02:41:39] Cave Johnson: I've learned a lot about... my science.
[02:41:47] Cave Johnson: You remember what I said to her? Back in the chamber?
[02:41:50] Cave Johnson: Before we got knocked out.
[02:42:00] Price Broadbent: What was it?
[02:42:01] Cave Johnson: No? Nobody?
[02:42:06] Cave Johnson: I said, To hell with science.
[02:42:12] Cave Johnson: Me.
[02:42:20] Cave Johnson: Cave Johnson, CEO of Aperture Science.
[02:42:29] Cave Johnson: To hell with science.
[02:42:31] Cave Johnson: That's what I said.
[02:42:40] Cave Johnson: And I meant it.
[02:42:44] Cave Johnson: I've hurt a lot of people.
[02:42:49] Cave Johnson: I've done a lot of bad things.
[02:43:05] Cave Johnson: Indirectly, but that doesn't make it better.
[02:43:19] Cave Johnson: And I got a mirror held up to me.
[02:43:31] Cave Johnson: I can't keep.. doing this.
[02:43:43] Cave Johnson: So I practiced working with.. whatever this void is.
[02:44:02] Cave Johnson: Like I said, I don't have magical powers.
[02:44:14] Cave Johnson: It's something any of us can do with practice.
[02:44:24] Cave Johnson: But I can move only so little around.
[02:44:34] Cave Johnson: Just so tinily sway the universes to move in a certain way.
[02:44:52] Cave Johnson: And I'm going to use that power, finally, to bring myself somewhere else.
[02:45:02] Cave Johnson: There's a universe where I died.
[02:45:05] Cave Johnson: I really died.
[02:45:12] Cave Johnson: the GLaDOS system never took over aperture.
[02:45:42] Cave Johnson: And Carolyn is still there, at that desk.
[02:45:57] Cave Johnson: That's where I'm going to go.
[02:46:10] Cave Johnson: I'm going to be a better man.
[02:46:33] Dustin Rory: .// Well then
[02:46:43] Cave Johnson: You, handshake guy.
[02:46:44] Cave Johnson: Ethan.
[02:46:47] Dustin Rory: Yeah?
[02:46:48] Cave Johnson: Come here.
[02:46:54] Cave Johnson: /me wraps Ethan up in a hug
[02:46:56] Cave Johnson: /me wraps Ethan up in a hug.
[02:47:09] Dustin Rory: Uh....
[02:47:17] Cave Johnson: /me pats Ethan twice on the back, and lets go.
[02:47:17] Dustin Rory: /me Simply stands letting it happen kind of confused on what to do.
[02:47:28] Cave Johnson: Never shake my hand. I thought we were closer than that.
[02:47:35] Cave Johnson: GRID.
[02:47:43] Cave Johnson: /me wraps the Grid in a hug.
[02:47:57] Cave Johnson: Ah, shit, Manhack, sorry, didn't mean to bump it.
[02:48:14] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: where the *fuck* did I even get this manhack?
[02:48:21] Dustin Rory: .// Void magic
[02:48:28] Cave Johnson: There's not one thing in this world I hate more than the Combine.
[02:48:36] Cave Johnson: When you get back, think about it for me.
[02:48:38] Cave Johnson: You've gotten this far.
[02:48:45] Cave Johnson: .//THE HEAD SHAKE
[02:48:55] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: .// shh
[02:48:55] Cave Johnson: Maybe that unionwashing isn't as effective as they say.
[02:49:00] Cave Johnson: You've got a good heart in there.
[02:49:02] Cave Johnson: I swear you do.
[02:49:04] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: .// internal power struggle
[02:49:13] Cave Johnson: Come here.
[02:49:17] Cave Johnson: /me wraps price in a hug.
[02:49:17] Dustin Rory: GRID, once we're back I hope you choose the right side.
[02:49:31] Dustin Rory: I want to call you an ally.
[02:49:39] Dustin Rory: Not just a friend but also a comrade.
[02:49:56] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: This has been so much, I'm not even sure what I'm going to do.
[02:50:08] Price Broadbent: /me would stand for a moment, still confused on what to even think on anything. He'd hug Cave back.
[02:50:13] Dustin Rory: I don't either.
[02:50:21] Dustin Rory: But we can all figure it out together.
[02:50:24] Cave Johnson: /me pats the man on the back twice and lets go.
[02:50:26] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: either way, I'm not getting either of you killed
[02:50:32] Dustin Rory: Good to know
[02:50:35] Cave Johnson: You've got a lot ahead of you, kid.
[02:50:42] Cave Johnson: This whole thing, this was just the start.
[02:50:55] Cave Johnson: You're going to do so much better. I know it.
[02:51:17] Price Broadbent: /me would nod. "I... Thank you, Cave."
[02:51:21] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: // Life is fantastic, I'm eating plastic!
[02:51:29] Cave Johnson: And, Ethan.
[02:51:39] Cave Johnson: I know Gordon Freeman has the destiny or whatever it is to take down the Combine.
[02:51:44] Cave Johnson: But if he didn't, I'd think it was you.
[02:51:51] Cave Johnson: Maybe this next universe doesn't have one.
[02:51:57] Cave Johnson: Maybe that can be you.
[02:52:01] Dustin Rory: I'll try to live up to that expectation.
[02:52:11] Cave Johnson: Alright.
[02:52:14] Cave Johnson: It's time.
[02:52:21] Cave Johnson: It was... beyond a pleasure.
[02:52:26] Cave Johnson: Meeting all of you.
[02:52:35] Dustin Rory: Same here, I hope we can eventually see each other again.
[02:52:40] Cave Johnson: You all are amazing, and you have helped teach me so much.
[02:52:56] Cave Johnson: Maybe my Aperture will learn a thing or two about multiverse travel, eh?
[02:53:00] Cave Johnson: /me chuckles.
[02:53:16] Dustin Rory: Good luck on your end Cave.
[02:53:16] Cave Johnson: I'll make sure to stop by every now and then.
[02:53:22] Price Broadbent: I think the sheer amount of my questions is beyond the amount of universes there are
[02:53:26] Dustin Rory: We look forward to it.
[02:53:32] Cave Johnson: There's a lot more to learn.
[02:53:37] Cave Johnson: I'm not smart.
[02:53:44] Cave Johnson: That's just what I learned through experience.
[02:53:49] Cave Johnson: Seek out that knowledge, you can find it.
[02:54:01] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: hey, maybe you can become friends with that universe's version of us
[02:54:08] Dustin Rory: Who knows
[02:54:09] Cave Johnson: Heh. Here's hoping.
[02:54:15] Dustin Rory: Anything can happen
[02:54:16] Cave Johnson: Good thing there's no Combine in this universe.
[02:54:22] Cave Johnson: I've got all of your names.
[02:54:26] Cave Johnson: Pre-war info is...
[02:54:30] Cave Johnson: Pretty extensive.
[02:54:33] Cave Johnson: /me coughs.
[02:54:34] Cave Johnson: Alright.
[02:54:41] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: ...how extensive?
[02:54:42] Cave Johnson: I need to go, or I'll miss my chance.
[02:54:58] Dustin Rory: Alright, good luck on your future endeavors.
[02:55:00] Cave Johnson: I'm sorry you had to get your circumcision redone, GRID.
[02:55:04] Cave Johnson: That's how extensive.
[02:55:12] Cave Johnson: Goodbye, everyone.
