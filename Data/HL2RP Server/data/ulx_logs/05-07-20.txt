[22:31:43] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.19691: I should probably go grab him right now, I could bring him here.
[22:32:01] Joseph Kimsler: I can't decide someone's life, officer. That is for your wisdom, not mine.
[22:32:06] Joseph Kimsler: If he is mentally unfit, you know what to do.
[22:32:25] Joseph Kimsler: The reason I never enlisted is because of my weak stomach for those sorts of things.
[22:32:26] Fred Chick: // can i be let out its been 2 cycles
[22:33:34] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.19691: Hmph. Understandable. However, I will not tolerate his anti-citizen honkey donkey.
