[10:12:15] Zandrew Bennet: /me begins to tear up at the eyes, their eyesockets drooling and overflowing with tears like a witches cauldron.
[10:12:27] Zandrew Bennet: I can see something... 
[10:12:33] Candrew Bennett: A vision?
[10:12:38] Zandrew Bennet: /it Reality crumbles.
[10:12:43] Zandrew Bennet: /it You begin to visualise something.
[10:12:47] Mitchell Lazarus: .// This is fucking terrifying and I don't know why.
[10:13:28] Zandrew Bennet: /it The world around you is dark, and you see nothing. The path forwards is paved with good intentions, yet leads to evil.
[10:13:36] Zandrew Bennet: /it You see something horiffic. The cthulu of half life two rp.
[10:13:41] Zandrew Bennet: /it The burnt land.
[10:14:02] Mitchell Lazarus: .// Otherwise known as the Minging Rebel wannabe.
[10:14:44] Zandrew Bennet: /it You can see it clearly. Oh god. It's tells you the future:
[10:15:03] Zandrew Bennet: /it And in their conquest against the blackened souls of the roleplayers, their prowess was shown.
[10:15:15] Zandrew Bennet: /it In his crusade, the secretive admins bestowed upon him terrible power and speed, and with his might he crushed the obsidian pillars of the Nutscript Temples.
[10:15:32] Mitchell Lazarus: .// The Mingeslayer
[10:15:34] Zandrew Bennet: /it He set forth without pity upon the players of the countless gamemodes. Unbreakable, incorrutible, unyielding, the Rat sought to end the dominion of the Dark Realm.
[10:15:44] Zandrew Bennet: /it Tempered by the fires of roleplay, his iron will remained steadfast through the servers that prey upon the weak.
[10:15:56] Zandrew Bennet: /it  For he alone was the Mingelord, the Unchained Roleplayer, who sought retribution in all servers, toxic and quality, veterans and minges, in the beginning, and the end.
[10:16:06] Zandrew Bennet: /it And he hunted the slaves of Roleplay with barbarous cruelty; for he passed through the divide as none but ERPers had before.
[10:16:18] Zandrew Bennet: /it In the first age, in the first server, when the gamemodes first strengthened, one stood. Burned by the embers of the schema, his soul blistered by the fires of Erotic Roleplay and tainted beyond ascension, he chose the path of perpetual torment.
[10:16:25] Zandrew Bennet: /it And in his ravenous hatred, he found no peace; and with boiling blood he scoured the Clockwork plains seeking vengeance against the dark operators who had wronged him.
[10:16:42] Zandrew Bennet: /it He wore the crown of the Minges, and those that tasted the bite of his sword named him...the rat
[10:16:51] Zandrew Bennet: /it Could he be a minge, spawned from the loin of a grotesque gamemode? Yet, the seal of the ERPer binds him. His origin is as dark as his coming.
[10:17:01] Zandrew Bennet: /it The power held within the gamemode will punish toxic players and veterans alike. It will crush the divide. It will corrupt all servers. It will create the monster. He must never be found
[10:17:11] Zandrew Bennet: /it Yet even as the HL2RP Hitman levels in the spoils of his Half-Life Wars, another shall rise from the fires: a dark minge consumed by the gamemode. And even the HL2RP Hitman shall weep in his shadow.
[10:17:21] Zandrew Bennet: /it The roleplayer-turned-minge, the rat, birthed of the dawn of his ascension, by his hand we cross the divide. And for the rat's tribute, he shall be granted the form of the Script Master
[10:17:30] Zandrew Bennet: /it This is the prophecy, the creature tells you.
[10:17:56] Candrew Bennett: A future is laid before us- a *bright* future.
[10:18:35] Zandrew Bennet: /it You hear the hum of APCs in the background. Above you, the clouds part. You see something in the sky, a tainted string of words. It fills you with horror, yet the sun it brings shines down upon you.
[10:18:40] Mitchell Lazarus: .// Alright I'm gonna leave before I get bullied by two Clone's.

[17:46:04] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.29332: We seriously need a undercover unit
[17:46:16] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.29332: /me Takes off front Mask area
[17:46:22] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: Yeah. At least some informant. But informants are... tricky.
[17:46:23] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.29332: Like seriously
[17:46:31] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.29332: Just send in a unit
[17:47:00] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: I guess. I dunno. They probably thought of that. I... wouldn't be a good match for that either way.
[17:47:03] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.29332: By the way we can take off masks in nexus, citizens can't see in here
[17:47:17] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: Good point.
[17:47:42] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: /me grabs hold of the front part, and soon detatched it. There was a small psst of air.
[17:47:52] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.29332: /me When 29332 takes off his mask he is a white, blue eyed, black hair, male
[17:48:30] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: /me 33698 looked fairly average. Hair was brown, blue eyes, but apart from that, nothing unusual.
[17:48:33] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.29332: I going to talk to some one about that
[17:48:56] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: Yeah. Problem is that most of our units are memory replaced. Probably. Makes us a bit easier to spot.
[17:49:06] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.29332: Most
[17:49:16] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: But having people who are not memory replaced makes them much more likely to go rouge.
[17:49:37] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.29332: Do I look like I would go rogue?
[17:49:45] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: No. Not really.
[17:50:00] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.29332: I have brought down a rebel hideout and killed a Anti Citizen one
[17:50:06] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: But I mean, CCA is probably really careful about that crap. Damn.
[17:50:23] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.29332: If that doesn't make me a loyal person by design then I don't know what is
[17:50:56] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: Yeah. You seem pretty trustworthy to me. But CCA doesn't care most likely.
[17:51:05] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: They probably see you as a risk.
[17:51:21] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.29332: Lose canon probably
[17:51:50] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: Yeah. I dunno. I decided to just go with memory replacements right away when I joined. Figured it would save me a lot of trouble in the future.
[17:51:52] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.29332: Also here is your book back
[17:51:57] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: Oh, thank you.

[17:52:42] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.29332: I decided to keep it because humor is my best quality and some times loyalty can get in the way of humor
[17:53:13] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.29332: Well I think I good at humor
[17:53:24] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: I see. I just... I honestly was fine with loosing most of my memories. Not like I lived much as a civilian.

[17:56:30] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: They replaced my CID with the CP ID. Or whatever they're called.
[17:56:37] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.29332: Datapads?
[17:56:55] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.29332: Datapads are pretty much ID's
[17:57:15] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.29332: The Screen of nothing
[17:57:19] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: Yeah. Either way, I don't think they want me to remember my Civ days.
