[12:10:26] Justin Bail: // can do more shit
[12:10:34] Joseph Kimsler: //that's not the issue chicken
[12:10:38] Joseph Kimsler: //the issue isn't me needing a developer
[12:10:46] Joseph Kimsler: //the issue is that school comes first in my life
[12:10:55] Joseph Kimsler: //so when school is heavy, that means the server takes a hit
[12:10:55] Joseph Kimsler: /doorsethidden true
[12:11:03] Joseph Kimsler: //trsut me, i am NOT happy that the server is doing how it is
[12:11:07] Justin Bail: // it is you work 2 jobs you code and do school the least you can have is a extra hand to keep the server moving

[12:11:16] Joseph Kimsler: //i do
[12:11:18] Joseph Kimsler: //i have ollie

[12:11:47] Joseph Kimsler: //liek i said
[12:11:53] Joseph Kimsler: //the issue isn't that i need a programmer
[12:11:58] Justin Bail: // q
[12:11:59] Joseph Kimsler: //i can program, but i need other people to moderate when i can't
[12:12:12] Justin Bail: // you do you need extra hand to help when your busy
[12:12:17] Joseph Kimsler: //and i have that
[12:12:20] Joseph Kimsler: //i have two people who do that
[12:12:24] Joseph Kimsler: //except xyz hasn't been on
[12:12:24] Justin Bail: // no only for moderating

[12:30:49] Le'Kurl: // idk think so may need to reinstall
[12:30:57] Joseph Kimsler: //but yeah the whole idea behind that event was that eli was trying to do more experiments on the xen crystal
[12:31:03] Joseph Kimsler: //fucked it up again but to a lesser extent
[12:31:08] Joseph Kimsler: //and it caused a portal storm
[12:31:17] Le'Kurl: // bro eli is best charecter
[12:31:21] Le'Kurl: // fight me
[12:31:55] Ethan King: // Yee, I always thought the Idea of escaping a city and having to either find refuge in a different city or stay far away from city 8 to be cool.

[12:32:32] Le'Kurl: // yes rebels
[12:32:42] Joseph Kimsler: //our server is too small to have a map as big as i17
[12:32:42] Le'Kurl: // but civ and combine rp is fun as hell

[14:10:59] Joseph Kimsler: //just some little stuff until we can get the crafting update out
[14:11:06] Nick Dime: // Neat
[14:11:27] Nick Dime: // Perhaps this will bring some new pepes onto the server.
[14:11:37] Joseph Kimsler: //the crafting update? i'm hoping so
[14:11:47] Joseph Kimsler: //this is gonna be our version of a big minecraft update
[14:11:47] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: /pm Joseph You're character gonna get a ration? If not then I'ma close it down
[14:11:47] Joseph Kimsler: /doorsethidden true

[14:12:38] Joseph Kimsler: //correct
[14:12:44] Nick Dime: // God dammit, lmao
[14:12:45] Joseph Kimsler: //shit i need to program a fueledtool base
[14:12:53] Joseph Kimsler: //when you craft makeshift tools they'll vary in quality depending on random chance and your engineering shit
[14:13:08] Joseph Kimsler: //you may also get to craft pipe guns
[14:13:08] Joseph Kimsler: //may
[14:13:19] Joseph Kimsler: //problem with that is i need to do a whole other thing
[14:13:24] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: // bouta become fallout 4

[14:14:23] Joseph Kimsler: //wait
[14:14:24] Joseph Kimsler: /doorsethidden true
[14:14:25] Joseph Kimsler: //shit
[14:14:29] Joseph Kimsler: //have you played terraria
[14:14:33] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: // no
[14:14:34] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: // Yeah
[14:14:38] Nick Dime: // I fuckin love terraria.
[14:14:39] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: // I was joking with the no
[14:14:51] Joseph Kimsler: //MOAT.GG has weapons like that
[14:14:53] Joseph Kimsler: //where you can have like
[14:15:03] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: /pm Joseph A combine lock don't work
[14:15:06] Joseph Kimsler: //a "Pathetic Deagle"
[14:15:10] Nick Dime: Hmm, Wonder what happened.
[14:15:15] Joseph Kimsler: //or a "Powerful Sniper Rifle"
[14:15:17] Joseph Kimsler: //that sort of thing
[14:15:21] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: Yeah, that's what I planned to investigate.
[14:15:23] Joseph Kimsler: //with different modifiers for your accuracy and stuff
[14:15:31] Joseph Kimsler: .//oh yeah
[14:15:34] Joseph Kimsler: .//because there's a big hole in it
[14:15:36] Joseph Kimsler: .//so you can crawl through
[14:15:42] Joseph Kimsler: .//that's why
[14:15:49] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: /looc Oh. I was just gonna fuckin unlock it and enter normally.
[14:15:52] Joseph Kimsler: .//ah
[14:15:52] Joseph Kimsler: /doorsethidden true
[14:15:58] Joseph Kimsler: .//you gotta get someone to fuckin uh
[14:16:06] Joseph Kimsler: .//fix it\
[14:16:11] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: /looc Oof.
[14:16:13] Joseph Kimsler: //but anyways
[14:16:17] Joseph Kimsler: //i want to add that in for weapons
[14:16:20] Nick Dime: .// Sounds like a workshift to me.
[14:16:34] Joseph Kimsler: //so you can craft a pipe pistol with 0 engineering skill
[14:16:43] Nick Dime: Perhaps a workshift would be in order?
[14:16:46] Joseph Kimsler: //but chances are it'll suck ass and have a spread of 180 degrees
[14:16:46] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: Hm... 
[14:16:59] Nick Dime: // Noice
[14:17:07] Joseph Kimsler: //that's gonna be one of the more challengine things
[14:17:10] Joseph Kimsler: //challenging
[14:17:13] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: And uh, maybe. Haven't done a workshift yet though. So I may not be the most qualified.
[14:17:20] Nick Dime: I see
[14:17:36] Nick Dime: You think anymore of them are around?
[14:17:52] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: If the hole is messing with the lock, it most likely will be a job for the GRIDs. And I don't know.
[14:17:55] Joseph Kimsler: //also you'll be able to decompose items and craft just various random shit
[14:18:12] Joseph Kimsler: //so if you have scissors and a shirt you can get sewn cloth
[14:18:15] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: For now, I would just leave it alone. I'll alert someone about it.
[14:18:20] Nick Dime: // It will be interesting to see you do that Q.
[14:18:23] Nick Dime: Got it
[14:18:26] Joseph Kimsler: //i'm looking forward to it
[14:18:30] Joseph Kimsler: //but that's part of the reason i'm not on
[14:18:44] Joseph Kimsler: //is because i'm either working on the crafting update or working on school
[14:18:48] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: // Oof
[14:19:06] Joseph Kimsler: //also this crafting plugin we have is great. it adds crafting bench entities, so you could have like, working metal forgery
[14:19:08] Joseph Kimsler: //no staff required
[14:19:14] Nick Dime: // Neat.
[14:19:24] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: // Nice.
[14:19:27] Joseph Kimsler: //i could talk about it for hours
[14:19:32] Joseph Kimsler: //because i'm hyped for it
[14:19:41] Nick Dime: // If only I had one of those when I was making a Pickaxe.
[14:19:50] Joseph Kimsler: //even then you'd have to find somewhere to forge metal

[14:20:23] Joseph Kimsler: //becomes anakin skywalker
[14:20:33] Joseph Kimsler: //well i guess he was darth vader at my point but you get what i'm saying
[14:20:40] Ethan King: // You ever want to add in Headcrabs and shit into the Outlands?
[14:20:48] Joseph Kimsler: //i do
[14:20:52] Joseph Kimsler: //i have issues with that thugh
[14:20:53] Joseph Kimsler: //though
[14:20:58] Joseph Kimsler: //if i do
[14:21:05] Joseph Kimsler: //the best means we have of doing that is via permaprops
[14:21:11] Joseph Kimsler: //meaning they'll always spawn in the same place
[14:21:23] Ethan King: // Oof
[14:21:24] Joseph Kimsler: //kinda convenient for certain things
[14:21:28] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: // Tfw the Jedi counsel could've just told him the full truth about him not being a master yet which would've prevented the entire Darth Vader shit, but instead they did vague word shit
[14:21:30] Joseph Kimsler: //like barnacles, cameras, turrets, and antlion dens
[14:21:53] Joseph Kimsler: //but for shit like hunters, it takes the challenge out of it. then players will get "The meta" and know where to avoid
[14:22:14] Ethan King: // Perhaps every week or so Change it up?
[14:22:21] Joseph Kimsler: //that's a good idea
[14:22:23] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: // Oof. Ooh, that could work
[14:22:25] Joseph Kimsler: //my idea was something programtic 
[14:22:25] Joseph Kimsler: /doorsethidden true
[14:22:29] Joseph Kimsler: //where i program in NPC spawners
[14:22:37] Joseph Kimsler: //and have it spawn them at basically anywhere in the outlands
[14:22:40] Joseph Kimsler: //but that's a lot better
[14:22:51] Joseph Kimsler: //way less programming on my part
[14:23:07] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: // I was playing a Rebel Vs Combine RP server a while ago

[14:24:02] Joseph Kimsler: //integration*
