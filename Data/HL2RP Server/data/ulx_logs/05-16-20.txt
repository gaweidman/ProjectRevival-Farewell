[00:40:39] Aleksei Kirrlov: /looc how you do those 
[00:40:57] Niklas Neuhausen: /looc look help and voice i think Q made as the first server with citizen voiceline
[00:41:35] Niklas Neuhausen: /pm i3 But really dont walk around with a armed weapon make it Empty atleast

[00:41:50] Aleksei Kirrlov: Say too loud
[00:41:55] Aleksei Kirrlov: /looc huh
[00:41:56] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: /pm Niklas I mean, you can't make it empty, but whatever.
[00:42:02] Aleksei Kirrlov: // cool
[00:42:10] Niklas Neuhausen: /pm if someone robs you and you got it loaded And he wins the roll you´re doomed so far.
[00:42:19] Niklas Neuhausen: /pm i3 yeah you could just dont load the ammo
[00:42:43] Niklas Neuhausen: /pm i3 if you have it armed and someone wins the Roll he got a MP7 you a USP beside a stunstick
[00:42:55] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: /pm Niklas Not really. Ammo sticks with you, so I would have to empty it all the time. 
[00:43:10] Niklas Neuhausen: /pm i3 if has that way
[00:43:25] Niklas Neuhausen: So
[00:43:36] Niklas Neuhausen: Dream about chese
[00:43:42] Niklas Neuhausen: Dream about CHeese
[00:43:46] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: /pm Niklas Plus, the SMG has to be holstered somehow, so it doesn't make much of a diffrence.
[00:44:03] Aleksei Kirrlov: Dwell on it
[00:44:19] Niklas Neuhausen: /pm i3 its for the Citizen harder to rob you if´s holster he need to open it,take it out load it.
[00:44:31] Niklas Neuhausen: /pm i3 basically 3 steps to rob the holster
[00:44:51] Niklas Neuhausen: First time
[00:45:06] Niklas Neuhausen: /actstand
[00:45:07] Niklas Neuhausen: So
[00:45:15] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: /pm Niklas I mean, does it matter? If someone takes it, it makes for fun RP at least.
[00:45:16] Aleksei Kirrlov: So?
[00:45:28] Niklas Neuhausen: /pm i3 or minge :I
[00:45:32] Niklas Neuhausen: /looc void
[00:45:42] Aleksei Kirrlov: /loc ight
[00:45:46] Aleksei Kirrlov: /looc ight
[00:45:49] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: /pm Niklas Then they get treated like a minge. This server doesn't get minges often, so I ain't worried.
[00:46:42] Niklas Neuhausen: /Pm i3 so i could try rob ya but still the Rebel knowledge wouldn´t be smart after i compromised the rebels so im doomed if i rob you by combines and rebels
