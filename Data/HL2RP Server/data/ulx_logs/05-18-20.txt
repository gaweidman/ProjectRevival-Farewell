[20:44:22] Timmy Pretzel: .// I have no clue of what lore ur following xD
[20:44:59] Timmy Pretzel: // This server use a custom lore or? 50299 said that the server was set in 1994 and that the combine invaded in 1974 20 years earlier
[20:45:25] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: // I honestly don't think the server has a real confirmed date
[20:45:31] Client "『𝕂𝕦𝕫𝕪𝕒』" connected.
[20:45:40] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: // But we use a little bit of Beta lore and normal HL2 lore in the server.
[20:45:53] Timmy Pretzel: // I mean combine didnt invaded in 1974 its clear.
[20:46:05] Timmy Pretzel: //
[20:46:13] Timmy Pretzel: // In tab it says August 18 2001 btw
[20:46:28] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: // I gave a date based off of what Q has said to me.
[20:47:11] Timmy Pretzel: // Combine didnt invade in the 80s and the Black mesa incident didnt happen in the 1974 it is clear that computer in the 70s didnt look like the one in HL1
[20:47:21] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: // He has said before that the Seven Hour war was before the 1990s so thats what I'm going with.
[20:47:39] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: // Whether it is custom or not, I really don'
[20:47:44] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: // Don't care
[20:47:48] Timmy Pretzel: // Its really weird it must be a custom lore

[20:48:10] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: // Don't know
[20:48:15] Timmy Pretzel: // Maybe Q never played half life 1
[20:48:18] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: // Tbf, HL is not the best with confirmed dates.
[20:48:24] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: // True
[20:48:41] Timmy Pretzel: // You can see that Half life 1 is set in the late 90s though

[20:49:38] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: // This is straight from the wiki btw.
[20:50:39] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: // Seven Hour War has no confirmed date
[20:51:01] Timmy Pretzel: // Its impossible that the combine invaded in the 70's though because all the tech in Half life 1 is from the 90s 
[20:51:15] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: // HL1 takes place in 2000 to 2009
[20:51:24] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: // HL2 is set 20 years after HL1
[20:51:50] Timmy Pretzel: // Not quite if you look better you could see that the computers in HL1 are clearly not the one of the 2000s and you can see many things that dont belong in the 2000s
[20:52:09] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: // That's because of the time the game was developed in. 
[20:52:15] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: // Officially, it is 200X
[20:53:14] Timmy Pretzel: // Seven hour wars is set in 2000's
[20:53:44] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: // Most likely shortly after HL1, since personally I believe the Combine came a few days or weeks after the BMI
[20:54:22] Timmy Pretzel: // I had read somewhere that the army were barricading cities to protect them from Xenians and then in the early 2000s combine came but the lore is very unclear tbh 
[20:54:35] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: // In HL Raising the Bar, it is suggested that the BMI happened in 2003
[20:55:21] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: // If you want to take a look, here ya go
[20:55:23] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: // https://half-life.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Half-Life_universe
[20:55:40] Timmy Pretzel: // Yes it could have happened in 2003
[20:57:00] Timmy Pretzel: // But according to the HELIX the combine invaded in the 70s
[20:57:17] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: // Eh. I might talk to Q about fixing that.
[20:57:29] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: // But honestly, it doesn't matter. Not like it ruins anything
