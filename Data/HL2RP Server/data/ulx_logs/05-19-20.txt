[21:22:19] UU-SeC.08: /Y SPEAK UP!

[21:23:03] UU-SeC.08: //nah you're good
[21:23:04] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // i dont speak latin*
[21:23:08] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: /y He spoke to me for a few moments, and mentioned that he wasn't our friend or foe. And by a while ago, only yesterday, but everything else was going fucky.
[21:23:08] UU-SeC.08: //i got what you meant
[21:23:10] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // i said that
[21:23:16] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: \
[21:23:26] UU-SeC.08: /y And you didn't try to tell me yesterday?
[21:23:29] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // like mundo(world) is Mondo in latin i think
[21:23:45] UU-SeC.08: //i never got far in latin. it's so weird becuase of all the verb and noun endings
[21:23:50] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: /y I also encountered the same messages from the person, and I felt like sharing it now before it had become a major problem.
[21:23:59] UU-SeC.08: //it's so much general memorization as opposed to langauge understanding
[21:24:07] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // :/ i can't say anything because i didn't study it
[21:24:23] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // i tried to speak korean
[21:24:28] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // i can't
[21:24:28] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: /y Admittedly, yes, I didn't. But yesterday there was a bit going on. I'm not trying to excuse myself for my mistake. But the guy told me he knows about the whereabouts of the rebels are. And he is willing to exchange info for something in return.
[21:24:33] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // i know a word
[21:24:45] UU-SeC.08: /y You excusing yourself doesn't quite do it!
[21:24:53] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // podo(uva) i don't know how to write it in english
[21:24:54] UU-SeC.08: /y I'll yell at you later.
[21:25:04] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: /y Yes but it is a risk to have him on this radio channel, it could harm us greatly in the long run
[21:25:08] UU-SeC.08: /y What does he want in return?
[21:25:09] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // that is the pronunciation
[21:25:21] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // jaja Korea in english and Corea in spanish
[21:25:38] UU-SeC.08: //i'm not a big language person. i took spanish because i had to and fell in love with it
[21:25:39] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // i don't know why do we change countries names
[21:25:48] UU-SeC.08: //couldn't tell you
[21:26:02] UU-SeC.08: /y What does he want in return?
[21:26:04] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: Dunno. I told him I would alert the higher ups about it. Since you all know the better course of planning.
[21:26:15] UU-SeC.08: /y Fucking.
[21:26:21] UU-SeC.08: /y Do you know if he has any connection to anything else?
[21:26:26] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: /y OOC PLEASE YELL
[21:26:28] UU-SeC.08: /y Anything out of your clearance level?
[21:26:32] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // like Italy and Italia, France and Francia, Russia and Rusia(not so much difference in writing), Alemania and Germany or Deutchland  
[21:26:53] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // Spain and Espa√±a jajajajaj
[21:27:01] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: /y No. I believe he is located in the outlands though, as he mentioned getting his mind changed about the combine after getting manhacked.
[21:27:13] UU-SeC.08: //yeah, germany in german is a drastic change
[21:27:26] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // why Deutchland?
[21:27:30] Client "Zapper" connected.
[21:27:30] UU-SeC.08: //couldn't tell you
[21:27:33] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // i mean Germany it's ok
[21:27:35] UU-SeC.08: /y No shit! Anyone would question it!
[21:27:39] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // is*
[21:27:58] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: /looc Imma walk closer so I can hear pretend I'm at the podium
[21:28:04] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // Norwegia and Noruega
[21:28:04] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: /y He also has that Black Mesa scientist with him. Or near him at the very least. The one from... yesterdays events.
[21:28:10] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // i mean
[21:28:12] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // wtf
[21:28:23] UU-SeC.08: //it's weird man
[21:28:25] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // is like similar but different
[21:28:43] UU-SeC.08: /radio This is sectorial 08 to the anti-citizen. Explain yourself, and do it now.
[21:29:15] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: /y Sir if I may
[21:29:16] Ethan King: /radio Ahh your here, I would like to give rebel information in hopes of helping the combine.
[21:29:22] UU-SeC.08: /y You may.
[21:29:22] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // im thinking in another
[21:29:45] Ethan King: /radio I would like to give rebel information in hopes of assisting the combine.
[21:29:47] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // how do you call people of USA? i mean, please don't say American
[21:29:52] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: /y During the time he came in contact today while both of you were off duty, he asked for a CP with the digits 33.
[21:30:05] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // i mean, in spanish we say estados unidenses, but in English?
[21:30:13] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: /y I don't know who they are, but they must be linked
[21:30:15] UU-SeC.08: //United States of America
[21:30:25] UU-SeC.08: /radio You're joking.
[21:30:33] Client "Zapper" spawned in server <STEAM_0:1:88228734> (took 183 seconds).
[21:30:33] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // but i mean how do you call people of USA? American?
[21:30:35] UU-SeC.08: /radio Someone who fled to the outlands wants to help us out.
[21:30:40] UU-SeC.08: //yeah, american.
[21:30:53] UU-SeC.08: //we're pretty selfish considering there's a north and south america set of continents
[21:30:58] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: /y I believe we should find whoever is related to this in the Metropolice ranks.
[21:31:06] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // is there any other form to call you?
[21:31:14] UU-SeC.08: //not off the top of my head
[21:31:20] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // i mean, you see your country like a nation
[21:31:26] UU-SeC.08: /y So you think a unit is involved in this
[21:31:40] UU-SeC.08: /radio That's absurd. You have an ulterior motive.
[21:31:45] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: /y Yes sir from what he has said, asking for a unit with the numbers 33.
[21:31:45] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: /y Okay, that was me. My initial digits starts with 33. I told him this yesterday, as he wanted something to adress me by.
[21:31:53] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // and i know you say you Americans and you see America like South or North, but i think i can call me "American"
[21:31:56] Ethan King: /radio Although it will almost inevitably lead to my death I will, You possibly won't listen but the rebels are planning a assault on the outlands combine base.
[21:32:01] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // because America is the continent
[21:32:03] UU-SeC.08: //yeah
[21:32:13] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: /y And you didn't tell me that?
[21:32:27] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // but i am ok with saying you Americans 
[21:32:34] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // i mean i have no problem
[21:32:35] Ethan King: /radio They are hoping you'll be to busy with the "Alien" creatures that have been popping up lately.
[21:33:05] UU-SeC.08: /radio So are you a loyalist? Did you become an anti-citizen and change your mind?
[21:33:30] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: /me sorta rubs his mask in a small amount of worry. He knew he most likely would get demoted or worse for not bringing this info sooner. Fun times.
[21:33:44] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: /it He will
[21:33:49] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: /looc void lmao
[21:33:49] Ethan King: /radio I'm somewhere around neutral. I realised rebelling would be useless either way.
[21:33:55] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // in English you say, like, NorwegiaN, CanadiaN, MexicaN, but for USA people American? i mean is a little strange, no offense
[21:34:00] Zapper<STEAM_0:1:88228734> changed their name to James Jacob
[21:34:07] Ethan King: /radio I might as well try to help the winning side before I died.
[21:34:11] UU-SeC.08: //no, i agree. It's because we call our country america
[21:34:16] UU-SeC.08: //well, for the most part
[21:34:23] UU-SeC.08: /radio Good.
[21:34:29] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: /me stands akwardly, not wanting to get involved in the drama of the i3.
[21:34:35] UU-SeC.08: /radio Who do you think is going to kill you?
[21:34:35] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // yeah but i have no problem, i love my country but i like USA
[21:34:47] UU-SeC.08: /radio Us, or the rebels?
[21:35:03] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // and USA is not only laws for all the country, i mean, the states have different laws
[21:35:05] Ethan King: /radio Well the rebels don't know this is happening so probably you.
[21:35:15] UU-SeC.08: //yeah. our government is definitely pretty different
[21:35:18] UU-SeC.08: //as far as govenrment goes
[21:35:24] UU-SeC.08: /radio Fair.
[21:35:29] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: /w And there goes my chance at becoming a damn HELIX. Fuckin hell...
[21:35:36] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // yeah, but here in Argentina it is laws for all the country
[21:35:43] UU-SeC.08: /radio Tell us what you know about the events in the outlands.
[21:35:51] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: /y So uh, you think this guy should be the new Anti-Citizen one?
[21:35:53] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // i mean i love my country, but we have a shit goverment(in my opinion)
[21:35:57] UU-SeC.08: Hell no.
[21:35:57] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: /y Haha.
[21:36:00] UU-SeC.08: /y Hell no!
[21:36:09] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // because here we have bad economy but i still love my country
[21:36:22] UU-SeC.08: //i agree here. not because of our economy because of awful corruption
[21:36:29] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // im not in  a bad economy situation
[21:36:46] UU-SeC.08: /y The guy before him makes current Anti-Citizen one look like the devil himself!
[21:36:51] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: // Visit greece or hungary, those places really suffer
[21:37:00] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // i mean, i love my country but i like USA, you can have corrupt politicals but you have the best economy
[21:37:05] UU-SeC.08: //true
[21:37:05] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: /y Maybe, just a joke.
[21:37:06] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // yeah
[21:37:08] Ethan King: /radio At the moment I'll say that the rebels are dangerously low on ammo. Their hiding away in the Outlands sewer system scouting every now and then until you guys seem to busy to deal with them.
[21:37:14] UU-SeC.08: //that's because the politicians are corrupted by the big businesses
[21:37:16] UU-SeC.08: //money talks
[21:37:22] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // yeah
[21:37:39] UU-SeC.08: /radio Oh, really?
[21:37:45] UU-SeC.08: /radio This is quite a bit of information.
[21:37:56] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // i mean, we are too far but  in the same country, why do we have so many difference?
[21:38:00] Ethan King: /radio Then they'll probably either use a blowtorch to go through a hole leading to your base or through a tunnel in a secret hideout.
[21:38:03] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // same continent*
[21:38:08] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: /me would take a few breaths, collecting himself and standing as far upright as he could.
[21:38:15] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: // Corrupt politics can't always be there, since term limits exist.
[21:38:24] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // yes
[21:38:30] Ethan King: /radio Though the hideout is filled with manhacks so it's probably the first option.
[21:38:33] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // why do i say i mean all the times?
[21:38:39] UU-SeC.08: /radio Hm.
[21:38:42] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: // Idk
[21:38:54] UU-SeC.08: /radio This is absolutely some of the more helpful things we've gotten.
[21:39:05] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // but is strange see us very different 
[21:39:06] UU-SeC.08: /radio Tell us about the Black Mesa scientist.
[21:39:23] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // and we can talk in million of Kilometers in just a few of seconds
[21:39:28] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: /y You don't think we're gonna get killed for knowing this right?
[21:39:29] UU-SeC.08: //yeah
[21:39:36] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: // this is amazing jajaj
[21:39:48] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: /y Maybe if you don't have mem replacements.
[21:40:06] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: /y I don't require memory replacement, and I never will.
[21:40:07] UU-SeC.08: /y If this works, you're all promoted.
[21:40:33] Ethan King: /radio He seems way too freaked out to be of any use but. He's adjusting to the new "Earth" I think he could be a annoyance if he's given the right equipment.
[21:40:45] UU-SeC.08: /radio Annoyance to the Combine?
[21:40:48] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: /PM uu what do you think about the actual USA goverment? i can't give my opinion because im not from there, but what do you think
[21:40:49] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: /y You brag about it like its a trophy
[21:40:54] Ethan King: /radio Yeah
[21:41:08] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.33698: /me hearing that, felt a shit ton better, but he didn't exactly let down his guard. He knew he most likely would be in trouble either way.
[21:41:12] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: /pm UU and i didn't say this in the chat because maybe a fight may start
[21:41:19] UU-SeC.08: /pm eliza I'm a pretty cynical guy, so I'm probably not the best person to ask.
[21:41:29] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: /looc you take long to type my dude

[21:42:42] Elizabeth Sk√ºlberg: /pm UU it is just my opinion for ALL the goverments
[21:42:44] UU-SeC.08: /pm eliza yeah, corruption is inherent
[21:42:50] UU-SeC.08: /pm eliza you can't really fix it.

[21:43:09] UU-SeC.08: /pm eliza i'm considering not voting because it means nothing. like it's still a democracy, but there are so many legal loopholes and other shit that your vote doesn't erally do much
