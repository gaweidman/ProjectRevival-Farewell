[12:55:33] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.98240: No why
[12:55:40] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.19267: Oh.
[12:55:50] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.19267: I was thinking you would be talking about god right about now.
[12:56:00] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.98240: Why would I talk about god?
[12:56:06] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.19267: Whatever.
[12:56:09] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.98240: Haha
[12:56:10] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.19267: You know.
[12:56:23] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.19267: The only reason we have a Nexus here, is because they have a Rebel base in the Outlands
[12:56:35] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.19267: And the reason they have a Rebel base in the Outlands, is because we have a Nexus here.
[12:56:44] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.19267: It just makes no sense to me.
[12:56:49] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.98240: Yeah thats because we're fighting
[12:56:58] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.19267: Why?
[12:57:09] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.98240: Because they are rebels and we're Combine
[12:57:11] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.19267: You ever stop to think about your job 98?
[12:57:23] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.19267: We're Combine. Their Rebels. Their Rebels. We're Combine.
[12:57:26] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.19267: It's all it is.
[12:57:30] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.19267: For some reason.
[12:58:05] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.98240: Even if it makes no sense, I'll fight for the Combine.
[12:58:18] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.98240: Hopefully your on the same page
[12:58:24] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.19267: Sure, My loyalties stand, but I don't see the point in fighting.
[12:58:42] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.98240: The point of fighting is to protect the civilians who live here
[12:58:55] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.19267: Yet I've seen cops abuse them for nothing!
[12:59:04] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.19267: You think that's protection?
[12:59:04] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.98240: Those are the bad cops.
[12:59:15] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.98240: Stay on the good side and you'll fight for the good side
[12:59:25] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.98240: Simple as that
[12:59:48] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.19267: Yeah. Most of the cops are like that. Don't you think that the Combine would be a little concerned about most of their workforce abusing their job?
[13:00:09] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.98240: The Combine have bigger issue's to deal with.
[13:00:16] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.19267: I can see why people are rebelling. There are too many people abu-
[13:00:22] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.19267: Even the smallest issues.
[13:00:27] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.19267: Can become the biggest ones.
