[02:10:26] Unknown: Everything around you is a resource.

[02:12:18] Justin Bail: we could
[02:12:23] Unknown: Let it soak in deep enough, surely it'll be the same color.

[02:59:32] Justin Bail: what
[02:59:40] Unknown: Do you know what they do to them?
[02:59:46] Justin Bail: yes
[02:59:52] Unknown: It's terrible.
[02:59:52] Justin Bail: they -
[03:00:03] Justin Bail: are you sure you wanna know what happens to combine
[03:00:08] Justin Bail: when they join up
[03:00:23] Unknown: I figure I'll find out anyways. I imagine it's as bad as, if not worse than this.
[03:00:40] Unknown: I noticed in the back there's some type of plug.
[03:00:40] Justin Bail: look if you cant take off helmet i will i seen bad thingsd
[03:00:45] Justin Bail: plug?
[03:00:51] Morgan Beck: Alrighty. I can work with this. Just gotta get some supplies and I am golden.
[03:00:52] Justin Bail: like a charging port
[03:00:52] Unknown: Yeah. Nothing hug,e just like a little thing.
[03:01:04] Justin Bail: for like computors
[03:01:05] Unknown: I checked the back, and sure enough, there's a plug for it.
[03:01:08] Unknown: Not for computers.
[03:01:10] Unknown: Not like that.
[03:01:16] Justin Bail: what kind plug is it
[03:01:18] Unknown: Way smaller. And this is a human being, not a computer.
[03:01:33] Justin Bail: well they do get brainwash
[03:01:39] Unknown: I'm not sure. But I looked through as close as I could, and it seems like the wires from there go all around the armor. Mainly the helmet.
[03:01:39] Justin Bail: and heavily tortured
[03:01:48] Justin Bail: hm
[03:01:51] Justin Bail: maybe
[03:01:54] Justin Bail: its radio
[03:02:06] Justin Bail: like his comms
[03:02:10] Unknown: Could be.
[03:02:12] Justin Bail: or tracking device
[03:02:19] Justin Bail: maybe
[03:02:21] Unknown: Well, it's not live anymore, I can tell you that.
[03:02:28] Justin Bail: yea
[03:02:42] Unknown: I didn't see anything that *looked* like anything for power, so some of it may have come from the heart.
[03:02:50] Justin Bail: the heart
[03:02:53] Unknown: .//sorry void
[03:02:54] Justin Bail: thats
[03:02:57] Justin Bail: // okay
[03:02:58] Unknown: I didn't see anything that *looked* like anything for power, so some of it may have come from the body.
[03:03:06] Morgan Beck: // Hm?
[03:03:11] Justin Bail: like asorbing blood for power
[03:03:14] Justin Bail: or something
[03:03:21] Unknown: No, like how when you eat food, it gives you energy?
[03:03:25] Justin Bail: yes
[03:03:27] Unknown: I imagine they take some of that energy and use it for whatever this is.
[03:03:36] Justin Bail: you know bone marrow
[03:03:43] Justin Bail: where they expierement
[03:03:49] Justin Bail: with it to make life forms
[03:03:52] Justin Bail: i heard that
[03:03:54] Justin Bail: but
[03:03:58] Justin Bail: never thought
[03:04:01] Morgan Beck: // oh my fucking god this has stereotypical japanese music?
[03:04:03] Justin Bail: it happened
[03:04:05] Unknown: //LMAO
[03:04:13] Unknown: //one version of the map has fly me to the moon on it
[03:04:16] Unknown: //IN OTHER WORDS
[03:04:19] Unknown: //PLEEEASSSEEE BE TRUEEE
[03:04:30] Justin Bail: // fly me to moon and let play among the stars
[03:04:44] Unknown: //YOU ARE ALL I LONG FOR ALL I WORSHIP
[03:04:46] Unknown: //AND ADOOOORE
[03:04:48] Morgan Beck: // This shit ain't bad tbh

[03:06:01] Justin Bail: // or
[03:06:03] Unknown: //oh right sorry
[03:06:16] Unknown: I don't know. It could be that. Maybe it's some advanced science I don't know about.
[03:06:19] Morgan Beck: // This place has a lot of music. Goddamn
[03:06:27] Unknown: But I imagine some power is coming from the body.
[03:06:30] Justin Bail: well combine have some advance tech
[03:06:30] Morgan Beck: // I was worried I was gonna be stuck with two songs
[03:06:32] Unknown: That or it's some sort of neural uplink.
[03:06:33] Justin Bail: but
[03:06:36] Justin Bail: its crackable
[03:07:01] Unknown: So like, connecting it to the brain to control other things, or feel stimulus other than what the human body knows by default.
[03:07:10] Unknown: I'm not sure. Cyberntics. Are interesting.
[03:07:18] Justin Bail: yes they are
[03:07:19] Justin Bail: well
[03:07:21] Justin Bail: hm
[03:07:24] Justin Bail: wait

[03:07:44] Justin Bail: i swear they do
[03:07:50] Unknown: I'm not sure. I looked in the helmet. I saw some kind of microphone and some other apparatus.
[03:07:56] Justin Bail: that
[03:08:00] Justin Bail: sound like comms
[03:08:04] Justin Bail: if its mic
[03:08:04] Unknown: It could be.
[03:08:08] Justin Bail: well
[03:08:13] Justin Bail: should look intoi t
[03:08:14] Unknown: I noticed there are speakers on the other end of the mask too.
[03:08:15] Morgan Beck: // So I got four songs. Nice
[03:08:19] Justin Bail: speakers?
[03:08:20] Unknown: As if they digitized the voice or scrambled it somehow.
[03:08:21] Unknown: Yeah.
[03:08:25] Unknown: Not huge ones like a subwoofer.
[03:08:27] Justin Bail: okay
[03:08:29] Unknown: But they do make noise
[03:08:32] Justin Bail: that just sonds like coms
[03:08:37] Justin Bail: now
[03:08:41] Unknown: Yeah, but the speakers are on the outside.
[03:08:42] Unknown: Not the inside.
[03:08:46] Justin Bail: outside
[03:08:48] Justin Bail: hm
[03:08:57] Justin Bail: that is strange
[03:09:06] Unknown: Could have been some type of voice scrambler?
[03:09:10] Justin Bail: yes
[03:09:11] Unknown: Do they have strange voices?
[03:09:14] Justin Bail: voice scrambler
[03:09:16] Justin Bail: okay
[03:09:21] Justin Bail: combine have those
[03:09:30] Justin Bail: just remember
[03:09:41] Unknown: Oh.
[03:09:44] Unknown: Then that'd be it.
[03:09:51] Unknown: Or it could be a translator.
[03:09:56] Justin Bail: yes
[03:10:00] Justin Bail: wanna test it
[03:10:11] Unknown: I can't, the suit isn't powered
[03:10:15] Justin Bail: hm
[03:10:23] Justin Bail: can i see what port on his head looks like
[03:10:30] Unknown: The port isn't on the head.
[03:10:31] Unknown: It's on the back.
[03:10:36] Justin Bail: okay
[03:10:42] Unknown: Do you know where your kidneys are?
[03:10:43] Morgan Beck: Ample room. Probably
[03:10:46] Justin Bail: yes

[03:11:12] Justin Bail: /me looks at side what kind port or plug ing dose look like
[03:11:38] Unknown: /it It doesn't look familiar. it's really small, not like a giant honking thing. It has combine technology written all over it though. Metaphorically, of course.
[03:11:49] Justin Bail: well
[03:11:54] Justin Bail: never anything i seen
[03:11:57] Justin Bail: before combine
[03:12:01] Justin Bail: or combine now
[03:12:03] Justin Bail: strange
[03:12:04] Unknown: It's probably their own technology.
[03:12:07] Unknown: No doubt.
[03:12:07] Justin Bail: yes
[03:12:13] Justin Bail: well good to learn
[03:12:16] Justin Bail: how it works
[03:12:18] Unknown: I'm not too worried about the type of port it is.
[03:12:21] Justin Bail: yes
[03:12:27] Justin Bail: well what else you find

[03:13:12] Justin Bail: they implant
[03:13:14] Unknown: A lot of scar tissue. Very pale body, no eyes.
[03:13:15] Justin Bail: things
[03:13:19] Justin Bail: yea
[03:13:33] Unknown: I saw there was a connection to what I can only imagine is the brain. I'm not sure how far the digitizing goes.
[03:13:40] Justin Bail: yea
[03:14:01] Justin Bail: this is just
[03:14:04] Justin Bail: so strange
[03:14:07] Justin Bail: combine are
[03:14:07] Unknown: I doubt they would digitize the brain, considering how incomprehensibly complex it is.
[03:14:14] Justin Bail: yea
[03:14:19] Unknown: I'm interested in what they do, no doubt.
[03:14:23] Unknown: Is there anything in specific you wanted to know?
[03:14:39] Justin Bail: arms
[03:14:44] Justin Bail: got anything on there
[03:15:03] Unknown: The arms are pretty standard. Pale and covered in scars. I noticed the scares line down the muscle.
[03:15:09] Justin Bail: yea
[03:15:11] Unknown: Especially at the bicep and tricep.
[03:15:14] Unknown: I'm not too sure why.

[03:16:09] Justin Bail: just
[03:16:14] Justin Bail: the fresh one
[03:16:19] Justin Bail: might have power
[03:16:24] Justin Bail: and more stuff on them
[03:16:30] Unknown: Possibly. Like I said, I don't see anything that i would imagine is a power resrve.
