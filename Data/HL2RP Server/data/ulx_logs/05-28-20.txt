[19:53:35] CCA.C08-HELIX.i5.50299: I researched in the database that a fluid mainly containing Antlion milk was able to kill Xenian life.
[19:53:42] CCA.C08-HELIX.i2.58841: // The LP is you reward for being real cool about this.
[19:53:48] Alfonso Lewis: // i took the first one and turned it in as contraband

[19:54:20] Alfonso Lewis: // i remember some random dude ran through and grabbed a pistol
[19:54:25] CCA.C08-HELIX.i5.50299: When I tried using the blood of the creature as a substitute combined with bleach, it was able to create the liquid.

[19:55:03] Alfonso Lewis: // we have like 6-7 radios
[19:55:16] CCA.C08-HELIX.i5.50299: I believe this formula may be able to eradicate the Xenian life inside the CWU building.
[19:55:26] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.98240: // How about instead of trying to find a specific Radio, One of you just give one up?
[19:55:39] CCA.C08-HELIX.i2.58841: Yeah, alright. I might see about taking it to the higher ups. Maybe get a work shift focused on making this stuff.
