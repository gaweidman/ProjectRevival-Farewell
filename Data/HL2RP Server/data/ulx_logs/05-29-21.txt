[16:20:54] Thornderrek Berry: I have an idea
[16:20:55] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.36012: //you could do it in either order as long as you have them both

[16:21:23] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.36012: /pm grid yes it does
[16:21:27] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.36307: yes
[16:21:28] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.36012: //over a year old, i just suck at running it

[16:21:49] Ron Boonini: /ooc oh its your server? very nice :D
[16:21:56] Ron Boonini: /ooc you get a lot of people in here or no?
[16:22:00] Thornderrek Berry: It'd probably need a jumpstart or something

[16:22:13] Thornderrek Berry: OOH
[16:22:17] Thornderrek Berry: I HAVE EVEN BETTER IDEA

[16:22:20] Thornderrek Berry: Car battery?
[16:22:28] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.36012: //HL2 isn't a need, but EP2 and EP1 are both recommended
[16:22:31] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.36012: //and CSS as always

[20:25:42] UU-CmD.17: City 17 was a substantial loss for both the citizen populus, overwatch, and the CCA.
[20:26:01] Thornderrek Berry: It blew up?
[20:26:09] Ethan King: You would be correct Thorn.
[20:26:11] Ethan King: It blew up
[20:26:12] UU-CmD.17: Affirmative.
[20:26:12] Thornderrek Berry: oh
[20:26:19] Thornderrek Berry: my poor pet birds
[20:26:22] UU-CmD.17: Due to unknown Xenobic threats, currently being investigated.
[20:26:35] UU-CmD.17: For the time being, you all will be placed in City 2.
[20:27:18] UU-CmD.17: It is located in pre-war Naples, Italy.
[20:27:20] Thornderrek Berry: // I'm gonna bonk someone with my frying pan before map change
[20:27:29] UU-CmD.17: The Consul is fine, as well as the CCA's high command.
[20:27:34] UU-CmD.17: do you have any questions?
[20:27:40] Thornderrek Berry: /me raises hand
[20:27:46] UU-CmD.17: Yes?
[20:27:53] Thornderrek Berry: can I have some water?
[20:28:04] UU-CmD.17: You will get water and filters.
[20:28:22] UU-CmD.17: City 2 is a long-abandoned city, so we have overwatch clearing the situation.
[20:28:29] UU-CmD.17: You two, citizens, will be made temporary-
[20:28:36] UU-CmD.17: Is this discussion boring you?
[20:28:42] Thornderrek Berry: no... not at all
[20:28:52] Thornderrek Berry: just wondering about those news articles
[20:29:39] UU-CmD.17: You all will be made temporary conscripts to serve alongside these metropolice and the overwatch forces. Consider this you earning your pardon.
[20:30:22] UU-CmD.17: You will be outfitted with the equipment shortly. Do any of you have any questions?
[20:30:27] Thornderrek Berry: does that mean I get a gun?
[20:30:43] Ethan King: Hm....will that mean its possible to become permanent Conscripts?
[20:30:44] UU-CmD.17: Sadly.
[20:30:49] Thornderrek Berry: Woo hoo!
[20:30:55] UU-CmD.17: Possibly. That has yet to be decided.
[20:31:05] UU-CmD.17: Consider this the end of the meeting, if that are all the questions.
[20:31:10] UU-CmD.17: Come with me, please.
[20:31:31] UU-CmD.17: CPs at this window.
[20:31:37] UU-CmD.17: Citizens at the other down the hall.

[20:31:53] Thornderrek Berry: oh boy
[20:31:57] Thornderrek Berry: we are gonna get guns
[20:32:04] Ethan King: Use them wisely.
[20:32:05] Thornderrek Berry: I've never shot a gun before
[20:32:08] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i2.69124: // i thought we would man the windows :(
[20:32:10] UU-CmD.17: A quartermaster will be with you shortly
[20:32:10] Ethan King: Guns are not toys and will never be.
[20:32:16] UU-CmD.17: A quartermaster will be with you shortly
[20:32:26] Ethan King: // Thorn with a gun is scary/

[22:56:59] CPT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: // Our improv events are always better.
[22:57:00] UU-CmD.17: //but yeah i love the implication, and by implication i mean fact
[22:57:03] 1LT Samuel Brody: // what about the rewards for attendance, or was getting promoted the rewards?
[22:57:03] CPT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: // That is the rule of PR.
[22:57:16] UU-CmD.17: //that in the old campaign, gman was responsible for the idea of host transfers and them being more accessible
[22:57:16] CPT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: // Yeah they were
[22:57:23] UU-CmD.17: //because of marliff
[22:57:25] UU-CmD.17: //i loved that campaign
[22:57:31] UU-CmD.17: //that was such a long-planned arc
[22:57:38] UU-CmD.17: //genuinely from the nihilanth campaign that was planned
[22:58:04] UU-CmD.17: //i am sad we'll have to leave that lore behind, but hey, we're in a new world
[22:58:06] 1LT Samuel Brody: // and because G-Man is an interdimensional beaurocrat, he's still alive, and still watching over us right now
[22:58:07] UU-CmD.17: //let's do something better
[22:58:15] UU-CmD.17: //yes, i haven't talked about gman's status
[22:58:23] UU-CmD.17: //i literally had to make a model for how the multiverse works
[22:58:34] UU-CmD.17: //i call it the cell model
[22:58:36] 1LT Samuel Brody: // was that a pain in the ass to do?
[22:58:41] UU-CmD.17: //not really
[22:58:43] CCA.C02-JUDGE.DvL.69124: // beans
[22:58:45] UU-CmD.17: //the biggest problem was, well i can't really say
[22:58:52] UU-CmD.17: //nah ican say
[22:58:55] UU-CmD.17: //without giving away the model
[22:59:08] UU-CmD.17: //there's already a multiverse inside of HL2's multiverse
[22:59:14] UU-CmD.17: //because xen exists
[22:59:19] UU-CmD.17: //combine homeworld exists
[22:59:38] 1LT Samuel Brody: // infinite dimensions exist in infinite dimensions
[22:59:41] UU-CmD.17: //but the other multiversal combine or other, say, earthy multiverses interacted with that multiverse
[22:59:43] UU-CmD.17: //exactly
[22:59:51] UU-CmD.17: //but that creates something really fucked up i don't like
[22:59:56] UU-CmD.17: //but i found a fix for it that i like a lot
[22:59:58] 1LT Samuel Brody: // dimension-ception
[23:00:03] UU-CmD.17: //it's not scientific by any means, but it feels legit to me
[23:00:37] 1LT Samuel Brody: // universes are hard to get the noggin around
