[13:15:31] Joshua Stevens: /ooc Da.
[13:15:45] Joshua Stevens: /ooc Well I guess the C17 one is just more... well... known.
[13:15:55] Joshua Stevens: /ooc because it looks like the traditional metrocop
[13:16:00] Gordo Kin: // You can find the base CO8 MPF in the playermodels menu.

[13:18:35] Gordo Kin: // Yeha, I'm very neutral when it comes to Beta and retail.
[13:18:37] Joshua Stevens: /ooc the playtesters didn't have fun.
[13:18:44] Joshua Stevens: /ooc Valve was gonna change the game anyways
[13:18:57] Gordo Kin: // It was for the best that they changed it.
[13:19:08] Joshua Stevens: /ooc yet most beta lovers can't see that.
[13:19:47] Gordo Kin: // Gamer, Once we get about 15 to 16 people on normally I do think we should change.
[13:20:03] Joshua Stevens: /ooc Yes that would be gamer, Gamer.
[13:20:04] Gordo Kin: // Or begin making a event to justify the change.
[13:20:10] Joshua Stevens: /ooc and not just a nukke
[13:20:18] Joshua Stevens: /ooc I say an uprising event would be pretty good.
[13:20:32] Gordo Kin: // Do we have the Wastland in are Lore?

[13:21:17] Joshua Stevens: /ooc That's also in Retail kinda
[13:21:30] Joshua Stevens: /ooc The Combine dried up the oceans alot where the water level has drastically gone down
[13:21:35] Gordo Kin: // Kinda but not as impactful as the Wastland.
[13:21:46] Joshua Stevens: /ooc tru
[13:21:56] Gordo Kin: // I thinking of a portal storm event.
[13:22:04] Joshua Stevens: /ooc Niice
[13:22:09] Joshua Stevens: /ooc Xen infestation?
[13:22:19] Joshua Stevens: /ooc Like they take over City 8
[13:22:44] Gordo Kin: // Like the entire City is Completely taken over by Xen, Radiation and shit. So the Combine civilians and rebels have to band together and escape the city.
[13:22:59] Joshua Stevens: /ooc that would be cool
[13:23:08] Joshua Stevens: /ooc I don't really like City 8 but I do like the Outlands
[13:23:14] Joshua Stevens: /ooc that it has
[13:23:44] Gordo Kin: // And then the Cp's, Civilians, Rebel Etc Etc have to find another city or stay and be killed.

[13:29:19] Joshua Stevens: /ooc yeah so honestly city 8 to me is too over industrial and empty. It doesn't give me the dystopian feel of combine rule
[13:29:30] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.98240 [X]: // Yeah I feel you
[13:29:31] Joshua Stevens: /ooc the because the citadel is blocked by like every building
[13:30:08] Joshua Stevens: /ooc Because how Valve did it with hl2 is  you go outside, and you see the breencast along with the citadel in the background
[13:30:18] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.98240 [X]: // I want district 47 or whatever the fuck it's called, Mostly because it's somewhat large and actually has working scanners.

[13:34:13] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.98240 [X]: // I don't remember that one and I have a Beta leak.
[13:34:36] Joshua Stevens: /ooc Like imagine going through that corridor and maybe it plays animations where your character is just limping and his head hurts or whatever the fuck
