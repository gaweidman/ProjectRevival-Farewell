[23:35:04] Ter'Langh: /v And just at the same time, you know it is released.
[23:35:48] Ter'Langh: /v There is no end, youngling. To anything. Life, energy, existence, they are evermoving ripples in the vortessence.
[23:35:51] Ter'Langh: /v As are we.
[23:36:01] Le'Kurl: /v yes master
[23:36:11] Ter'Langh: /v Silence.
[23:36:16] Ter'Langh: /v Listen. Feel. Do not speak.
[23:36:38] Ter'Langh: /v As this vortessence is pulled inwards, so we know it is released.
[23:36:51] Ter'Langh: /v All matter, all things, all energy, all of them oscillate between gateways.
[23:36:57] Ter'Langh: /v The gateways of life, death. The gateways of location.
[23:37:01] Ter'Langh: /v They are one and the same.
[23:37:23] Ter'Langh: /v Forever it has oscillated, forever it shall so oscillate.
[23:38:21] Ter'Langh: /v Yet, this does not make life meaningless.
[23:38:43] Ter'Langh: /v Vortal cords are severed every passing day. We must mourn.
[23:38:53] Ter'Langh: /v For one of our own has been lost.
[23:38:58] Ter'Langh: /v We mourn for ourselves, as humans do.
[23:39:18] Ter'Langh: /v Mourning is never done in the name of the dead. Only in the name of the still living.
[23:39:35] Ter'Langh: /v This is what we feel sorrow for.
[23:39:42] Ter'Langh: /v Being the one who still lives.
[23:40:44] Ter'Langh: /v We must feel some sorrow. To be of our people is an honor bestowed upon the most rare of the rare.
[23:41:03] Ter'Langh: /v To cut a vortal cord is to take something sacred.
[23:41:08] Ter'Langh: /v That is, to end one's life.
[23:41:24] Ter'Langh: /v Doing so is a damnable crime. Do you understand, youngling?
[23:41:39] Le'Kurl: /v i do belive so
[23:42:09] Le'Kurl: /v master is it neccisarly bad to take a life

[23:42:33] Le'Kurl: /v i guess you are right
[23:42:59] Ter'Langh: /v Evil still exists, youngling.
[23:43:20] Ter'Langh: /v The nature of oscillation, infinite creation and destruction, they never excuse misdeeds.
[23:44:02] Le'Kurl: /v i understand
[23:44:20] Ter'Langh: /v Such things as the Combine are evil, without doubt.
[23:44:45] Le'Kurl: /v could we forgive evil if they change?
[23:45:42] Ter'Langh: /v Such is a highly debated question.
[23:45:54] Ter'Langh: /v Forgiveness is only to be bestowed upon the affected.
[23:46:08] Ter'Langh: /v A mother cannot forgive her son's murder.
