[21:07:26] Lee Maylor: //it's hard to beat alyx and boneworks but i think it served as proof of concept that a good VR game doesn't have to be made by a triple a company
[21:07:57] CCA.C08-UNION.i2.51514: /me Simply raises his hand at the citizen and states, "I can't confirm anything, move into the city and take it up with somebody else"

[21:11:07] CCA.C08-UNION.i2.51514: Understood!
[21:11:25] Riley Beckam: /me grabs the tokens, grumbling. "Great, let me earn 10 LP again instead of bolstering your workforce."
[21:11:37] CCA.C08-UNION.i2.51514: Move along

[21:12:42] Lee Maylor: //we'll cross that bridge if we get to it
[21:12:51] Riley Beckam: Listen, my data is glitches, it was missing stuff like my blood type and apparently It's not tracking my LP
[21:12:53] CCA.C08-UNION.i2.51514: // BRB real quick.

[21:13:21] Riley Beckam: Um? Then who's problem is it?
[21:13:22] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.36307: yes
[21:13:25] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.36307: yours
[21:13:28] Riley Beckam: Because I should have 10 LP and I don't
[21:13:39] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.36307 to admins: bribery is a crime, right?
[21:13:49] Riley Beckam: /me scoffs. "It's not my fault I get transfered to this shithole and I have missing data."
[21:13:51] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.36307: work for 10 LP, then
[21:14:18] Riley Beckam: "I should already have 10 LP! I've been nothing but compliant, I've done my duties. Now when I need help you simply turn the cold shoulder?
[21:14:26] Riley Beckam: Is that how you treat loyalists around here?

[21:15:22] Riley Beckam: Just fix my data.
[21:15:27] Lee Maylor to admins: i liked this dude before but i'm not so sure anymore
[21:15:32] Riley Beckam: I'd like not to waste both of our time.
[21:16:06] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.36307: Look, if I put LP in your data without reason to back it up, I'll get in trouble.
[21:16:14] CCA.C08-UNION.i2.51514 to admins: I personally think CCA who only follow the rules are kinda iffy for genuine citizen to Combine RP so I let it slide for now.
[21:16:22] Lee Maylor to admins: air
[21:16:23] Lee Maylor to admins: fair
[21:16:30] Riley Beckam: I understand that, I swear I already had it. Just say I turned in contraband or something.
[21:16:37] CCA.C08-UNION.i2.51514 to admins: Of course if he does it again it would be an arrest.
[21:16:54] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.36307: No, I can't do that.

[22:24:53] Dave Keeger: /w I lost the OTA filters
[22:24:53] Jacob Lawson: /me would take out his combat knife and cut the individual's ties.
[22:24:54] Jacob Lawson to admins: kinda
[22:24:57] Jacob Lawson: .//void
[22:24:57] Dave Keeger: /w I stuffed them in that box
[22:25:03] Jacob Lawson: /w And a health kit.

[22:25:08] Jacob Lawson: /w We need to get literally underground

[22:26:10] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: Hey
[22:26:13] Dave Keeger: scared the fucking shit out of me
[22:26:13] Jacob Lawson: I didn't see shit if you didn't
[22:26:15] PVT Ethan King to admins: then would we know where they are located on the body?
[22:26:18] Dave Keeger: alright
[22:26:23] Jacob Lawson to admins: no bodies in the dropship, it's a synth
[22:26:23] Dave Keeger: can we head down please?
[22:26:24] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.36307 to admins: there'd probably be a scar
[22:26:35] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: I'm coming out of here you think I care who goes in?
[22:26:42] Jacob Lawson to admins: oh, you mean the biosignal?
[22:26:46] PVT Ethan King to admins: yeah
[22:26:56] Jacob Lawson to admins: it's implanted not far from the heart, but you don't know that
[22:27:07] Dave Keeger: I haven't really explored to far in
[22:27:09] Dave Keeger: so be careful
[22:27:14] PVT Ethan King to admins: and how exact are they when it comes to location? if we're outside of the city will we just not show up or something?
[22:27:25] Dave Keeger: a hole?
[22:27:28] Dave Keeger: carefull
[22:27:29] Jacob Lawson to admins: give me a sec to think about it
[22:27:39] Jacob Lawson to admins: i know the answer but i can't tell you
[22:27:44] Dave Keeger: // FUCKING LADDER
[22:27:47] Jacob Lawson: Agh, fuck.

[22:27:55] Dave Keeger: I'm good
[22:27:58] Jacob Lawson to admins: stop giving him metacommentary
[22:28:00] Dave Keeger: the fuck is this place?
[22:28:04] PVT Ethan King to admins: it would be pretty unfair for rogues if the Combine just knew exactly where they were at all times.
[22:28:06] Jacob Lawson: hell ofa place
[22:28:20] Dave Keeger: yeah
[22:28:23] Jacob Lawson: this is safe enough to put the shit
[22:28:26] Dave Keeger: indeed
[22:28:33] Dave Keeger: hmm
[22:28:36] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.36307 to admins: if it's implanted really close to the heart, and is pinpoint accurate, it seems like it'd be impossible for any rogue units
[22:28:39] Dave Keeger: shit smells nasty down there
[22:28:39] Jacob Lawson: dudey
[22:28:41] Jacob Lawson: that is
[22:28:44] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.36307 to admins: also who's giving who metacommentary
