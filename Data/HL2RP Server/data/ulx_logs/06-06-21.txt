[10:37:20] Riley Beckam: Um? what?
[10:37:23] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: /me places the rag and bottles on the desk.
[10:37:29] Riley Beckam: why would they wipe my data when I transfer here.
[10:37:32] Riley Beckam: my blood type doesn't change
[10:37:57] Riley Beckam: Also, they told me to come here to apply for CCA, wiping my LP doesn't really make sense.
[10:37:59] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: The data isn't wiped, it's just stored differently in different cities. There's no need to waste storage space for the global data system on less important pieces of information.
[10:38:08] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: So it's handled on a city by city basis.
[10:38:11] Riley Beckam: .// blood type is important lol

[10:38:27] Riley Beckam: You realize that...
[10:38:31] Riley Beckam: Storing it when I get here

[10:38:46] Riley Beckam: right?
[10:38:50] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: I'm not liking your tone.
[10:39:04] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: I think you might owe me an apology.
[10:39:18] Riley Beckam: Look pal, just admit the CCA has some errors, how else are we supposed to make it better?
[10:39:53] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: How you're talking to me now is an error. Apologize, or you're not getting your ID card back.
[10:40:37] Riley Beckam: /me scoffs. "Are you serious? it's not my fault your system had a glitch. I'm not blaming you at all, i'm just saying that's what happened."
[10:40:58] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: /me picks up the rag and the spray bottles from the desk.
[10:41:06] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Do you want to earn your LP?
[10:41:23] Riley Beckam: /me sighs for a moment before saying. "....Yes. Yes I do."
[10:41:35] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Then apologize.
[10:41:46] Riley Beckam: I'm sorry for speaking in a bad tone
[10:41:49] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: There you go.
[10:41:55] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: /me places the rag and bottles back on the desk.

[10:42:38] Riley Beckam: /me picks up the two bottles by the heads, careful not to apply too much pressure to the triggers, holding the rag in his right hand.
[10:43:06] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: First up, you're gonna wash these windows down here.
[10:43:12] Riley Beckam: Uh huh..
[10:43:22] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Those ones at the top aren't a priority, because people aren't putting their hands all over them. They're not as dirty.
[10:43:37] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Hey, hey, we're not done.

[10:45:37] Riley Beckam: Fun
[10:45:41] Riley Beckam: Or
[10:45:56] Riley Beckam: you could just give me the LP I should already have, and we can stop wasting eachothers time.
[10:46:24] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: I'm getting paid and fed to do this with you, my time isn't being wasted. 
[10:46:36] Riley Beckam: You don't have any paperwork to do?

[10:51:38] Riley Beckam: /me opted for the lysol bottle this time, spraying it all over the table. He then took his rag, doing one long swipe sideways along the counter, collecting the circular globs of cleaning fluid along the way. After going back and forth a few times, he pinch
