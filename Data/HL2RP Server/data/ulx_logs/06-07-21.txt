[10:48:52] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: You'll need it.
[10:48:52] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: Officer, I have a question to ask before I go.
[10:48:57] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Shoot
[10:49:22] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: I seen advertisements about serving this city and I saw a few green looking uniformed people when I got off the train.
[10:49:30] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: Any idea who those people may be? Military uniforms with guns.
[10:49:45] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: I never seen such a thing befoire.
[10:49:46] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Yeah, they're nicknamed the Conscripts.
[10:49:56] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: /me nods his head
[10:50:06] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: Cool to see.
[10:50:10] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: Alright officer.
[10:50:10] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Their official name is the Human Earth Military but nobody uses that. Even my commanding units call them the conscripts.
[10:50:15] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: Oh.
[10:50:21] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: They're a military force not very alike to Civil Protection-
[10:50:39] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Not very alike to Civil Protection.
[10:50:50] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: If you've seen the Overwatch Soldiers, the ones in the masks and the glowing eyes.
[10:51:12] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: So they do the heavy lifting and you guys do the policing?
[10:51:14] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Similar to that, but with different equipment and such.
[10:51:34] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Heavy lifting isn't the term I'd use. They just do more defense based things, while we do the policing.
[10:51:46] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: Ah.
[10:51:52] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: So, if the... Xenobes.. break out of somewhere, the Conscripts are the first to handle it.
[10:52:12] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: Good to know you guys are protecting this city from those creatures. I've seen enough at City 18.
[10:52:22] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: City 18? That places is as old as dirt, I swear.
[10:52:27] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: No disrespect, but I've been stationed there.
[10:52:45] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: I know how bad it is. Terminal hotle was the hotspot for everything.
[10:52:49] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: Too many rebels if you ask me.
[10:52:55] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: /looc hotel*
[10:53:08] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Really? The terminal? I always hated patrolling the areas not near the terminal.
[10:53:20] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: The layout there for above-ground sweeps was... so confusing.
[10:53:41] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: City 18 was small but comfy in my opinion. ASIDE from the judgement waivers that happened.
[10:53:56] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: But of course you didn't have to worry about that, or maybe you did.
[10:54:10] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: Civilian life ain't what it use to be, but we all make it one way or another.
[10:54:21] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Means to an end, my friend.
[10:54:26] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: /me stuffs his hands into his pockets to feel around for his ID
[10:54:36] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: Welp.
[10:54:40] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Judgement waivers here don't come as often. Normally if they happen, it's because really bad things are going down.
[10:54:47] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Either way, welcome to the city.
[10:54:55] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: Yeah, thanks officer.
[10:54:58] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: It's definitely an improvement from city 18.
[10:54:59] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Anytime.
[10:55:25] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: I'll be seeing you around or not. Honestly you guys all look the same and sound the same. 
[10:55:41] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Yeah, that's the point. Helps the anonymity.
[10:55:48] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: But yeah. See you around, stay out of trouble.
[10:55:55] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: /me takes hios hands out of his pockets before turning away and walking off saying "I'll see you, officer."
[10:55:59] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: /looc his
[10:56:23] Feng Yi Hseuh: hm
[10:56:24] Feng Yi Hseuh: What's in here?
[10:56:32] Feng Yi Hseuh: This place is a wreck...
[10:56:40] Feng Yi Hseuh: God, I miss City 45.
[10:57:06] Feng Yi Hseuh: Hey, how's it going.
[10:57:10] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: Not so good.
[10:57:15] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: I just got relocated here.
[10:57:36] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: A week train ride just to end up here from City 18.
[10:57:44] Feng Yi Hseuh: Hey, trust me, this is the worst of the city.
[10:58:01] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: I'm not lookming up to this city still. We need to wear these suits to breathe the air?
[10:58:04] Feng Yi Hseuh: The next district up is worth it, at least compared to some of the other places around.
[10:58:05] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: Doesn't seem safe at all.
[10:58:30] Feng Yi Hseuh: Yeah, we do. The City Administrator swears on everything that it's just a byproduct of productivity.
[10:58:43] Feng Yi Hseuh: Keep in mind that's a direct quote. Byproduct of productivity.
[10:58:44] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: Yeah, sure.
[10:58:57] Feng Yi Hseuh: There's a lot of industry in this city, at least from what I've seen.
[10:59:12] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: Have you seen the whole city yet?
[10:59:16] Feng Yi Hseuh: Never thought the sci-fi aliens would be obsessed with factories, but.. Yknow. This is how it is.
[10:59:26] Feng Yi Hseuh: The whole city, no. But this entire precinct I've been mostly through.
[10:59:39] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: Welp..
[10:59:45] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: I'm not looking forward to living here now.
[10:59:49] Feng Yi Hseuh: I got here... a couple hours ago anyways.
[11:00:01] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: Are there any jobs in this city?
[11:00:08] Feng Yi Hseuh: CWU's always open.
[11:00:23] Feng Yi Hseuh: They've got commerce and medical if you don't mind working for the Combine.
[11:00:29] Feng Yi Hseuh: For the sake of my safety I'm not saying that's a good or a bad thing.
[11:00:41] Feng Yi Hseuh: Sometimes citizens have odds and ends you can do.
[11:00:55] Feng Yi Hseuh: I've met a few people who scavenge as a day job.
[11:00:56] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: I'll keep that in mind.
[11:01:01] Feng Yi Hseuh: Apparently there's this metal stuff, let's see...
[11:01:05] Feng Yi Hseuh: /me checks his pockets for something.
[11:01:11] Feng Yi Hseuh: Nah, I don't have it.
[11:01:19] Feng Yi Hseuh: But there's this metal stuff, Resin I think they call it.
[11:01:32] Feng Yi Hseuh: It's just around the city, you can sell it back to the combine for two tokens a pop.
[11:01:42] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: Must be building material they use.
[11:01:55] Feng Yi Hseuh: I think that's what they said.
[11:02:10] Feng Yi Hseuh: it's quiet now, but it's not always like this.
[11:02:17] Feng Yi Hseuh: .//pretty sure this server is pretty new so

[12:25:43] Elias Ainsworth to admins: yeah I got that part, let me think of a decent way to do it.
[12:25:46] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023 to admins: do you know what swinging and cruising is
[12:25:51] Elias Ainsworth to admins: negative
[12:25:57] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023 to admins: swinging is when couples fuck other couples
[12:26:02] Elias Ainsworth to admins: ah
[12:26:10] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023 to admins: cruising is when gay men go out to certain places looking for other gay men to fuck
[12:26:21] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023 to admins: but it's fairly discrete how they do it
[12:26:23] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023 to admins: do that

[12:26:28] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023 to admins: go cruising for rebels

[12:27:37] Elias Ainsworth to admins: possibly
[12:27:37] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023 to admins: things like "so how'd this shit work out for you"
[12:27:41] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023 to admins: or "hey, how'd all this work out for you"
