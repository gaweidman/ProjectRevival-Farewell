[17:04:16] Bill Block: And we cant take them down without something like a pipe.
[17:04:16] Adrian Ximenez: /me would simply grab another biosignal, and the forceps that he had used before. The tools were cleaned, of course, and another, smaller scalpel. The size didn't really matter.
[17:04:27] Cortes Cocale: We....We finally check the back shed......

[17:05:44] Klaudiusz Olszewski: // buenos dias
[17:06:02] Adrian Ximenez: /me would then slowly make a small, precise incision on the top of one of his right ribs. Casually sliding the scalpel out, he took another spare pair of forceps, sterilized.
[17:06:03] God Frogge: // More Resin or Riot.
[17:06:13] Klaudiusz Olszewski: // the resin revolts of 06
[17:06:26] God Frogge: // its only 2 tokens i need like 5000 just  for an apartment
[17:06:28] Adrian Ximenez: /me would, with this pair, slowly part the top-opening of the wound. It peeled up, showing the red-innard of his chest, as the HELIX took his other pair of forceps, holding the biosignal.
