[20:58:10] Erwin Ramstein: Quite.
[20:58:22] Akio Mishima: What do you think about men who wear their hair in a bun?
[20:58:35] Olivia Ramstein: Shit looks ridiculous.
[20:58:35] Erwin Ramstein: Now that's something I cannot be neutral about.
[20:58:42] Olivia Ramstein: Like they want long hair, but then they chicken out.
[20:58:47] Erwin Ramstein: Men with Manbuns, are always assholes.
[20:58:54] Akio Mishima: Ah, phew.
[20:58:56] Erwin Ramstein: I have never seen a nice man with a Manbun.
[20:58:58] Akio Mishima: So you aren't completely greedy.
[20:58:59] Erwin Ramstein: Ever.
[20:59:00] Akio Mishima: What about Samurai?
[20:59:07] Erwin Ramstein: Never understood their Code of Honor.
[20:59:12] Erwin Ramstein: Interesting History, though.
[20:59:16] Paul-Henri Cartier: /pm akio what in the world are you guys talking about
[20:59:22] Erwin Ramstein: Nice armor too.
[20:59:22] Akio Mishima: /pm Paul rambling about business things.
[20:59:25] Akio Mishima: Oh, you think so?
[20:59:28] Erwin Ramstein: Wouldn't mind having a few of those..
[20:59:28] Akio Mishima: Are you trying to flatter me?
[20:59:30] Ethan King<STEAM_0:1:17219621> changed their name to CPT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus
[20:59:30] Erwin Ramstein: Samurai Masks
[20:59:32] Erwin Ramstein: To sell.
[20:59:33] Paul-Henri Cartier: /pm akio i heard something about manbuns
[20:59:37] Erwin Ramstein: They'd probably be illegal though.
[20:59:38] Akio Mishima: /pm paul we're just ranting
[20:59:40] Akio Mishima: Oh, really?
[20:59:41] Erwin Ramstein: With the uh, plating and all.
[20:59:43] Akio Mishima: Why, for being too cool?
[20:59:48] Akio Mishima: This is Tokyo, my friend.
[20:59:49] Erwin Ramstein: Probably for being Armor.
[20:59:52] Akio Mishima: It's easier to find shit than you think.
[21:00:06] Erwin Ramstein: If you can manage to find me a *Samurai Mask* I will be astonished.
[21:00:13] Akio Mishima: I will make one.
[21:00:15] Olivia Ramstein: // is it so jumbled cause it's speaking fucking japanese
[21:00:17] Olivia Ramstein: // holy shit
[21:00:21] Erwin Ramstein: Neat.
[21:00:29] Erwin Ramstein: I am hopeful in your, crafting abilities.
[21:00:34] Akio Mishima: Yeah.
[21:00:39] Akio Mishima: I killed that zombine and took all of his armor.
[21:00:42] Erwin Ramstein: /pm 51023 Still doing stuff?
[21:00:45] Erwin Ramstein: Wait what.
[21:00:45] Akio Mishima: You should see the wonders of the shit you can make with it.
[21:00:51] Akio Mishima: Eh?
[21:00:53] Erwin Ramstein: Akio that's highly illegal.
[21:00:54] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: /pm erwin yeah, sorry, we're finishing the guide up
[21:00:58] Akio Mishima: Yeah, what,
[21:01:01] Akio Mishima: Are you going to be a snitch?
[21:01:03] Olivia Ramstein: Seems he's into that.
[21:01:05] Erwin Ramstein: That's a Level-7 Violation.
[21:01:11] Erwin Ramstein: You could, quite literally be shot on sight for that.
[21:01:13] Akio Mishima: Yeah?
[21:01:17] Akio Mishima: Let me, I am Japanese.
[21:01:17] Paul-Henri Cartier: e
[21:01:23] Akio Mishima: Our lives are like a shattered gem, atleast in theory.
[21:01:28] Akio Mishima: Plus, my friend.
[21:01:30] Akio Mishima: You only live once!
[21:01:35] Akio Mishima: Why waste it on worthless frivolities?
[21:01:35] Erwin Ramstein: You're leaving up you getting shot, to theory.
[21:01:41] Akio Mishima: Whatever.
[21:01:45] Olivia Ramstein: Which is why you should try some self preservation.
[21:01:50] Akio Mishima: When I make profits on it, I'll make a cut for you to keep your mouth shut.
[21:01:52] Paul-Henri Cartier<STEAM_0:0:193599766> changed their name to CCA.C08-GRID.i1.23710
[21:01:54] Olivia Ramstein: 'Cause if you die tomorrow, that's it.
[21:01:56] Akio Mishima: Since you're a good businessman.
[21:02:17] Erwin Ramstein: I could honestly care less. I have no interest in telling anyone about the armor likely because its stashed somewhere intelligently.
[21:02:19] Akio Mishima: /me would slowly turn over, after hearing the woman say that.
[21:02:21] CPT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: /radio Captain on duty, moving to guard the Nexus.
[21:02:24] Erwin Ramstein: Least I am hopeful.
[21:02:25] Akio Mishima: So what if I die tomorrow?
[21:02:28] Akio Mishima: Look at the world around you, woman!
[21:02:33] Akio Mishima: Is this a world really worth growing old in?
[21:02:38] Erwin Ramstein: I mean.
[21:02:42] Erwin Ramstein: We have Popcorn.
[21:02:43] Olivia Ramstein: At least Erwin's hopeful.
[21:02:45] Erwin Ramstein: That's nice right.
[21:02:51] Akio Mishima: You're not hopeful, you're living a pipe dream.
[21:02:56] Akio Mishima: Bah.
[21:03:02] Akio Mishima: I'm going to go find work.
[21:03:04] Erwin Ramstein: I mean all this stuff is real for now.
[21:03:07] Olivia Ramstein: Have fun.
[21:03:38] Erwin Ramstein: /pm 51023 Oh, all good.
[21:03:48] Akio Mishima: /me would casually flip off the camera, almost in an attempt to bait it into logging him.
[21:04:24] Akio Mishima: /me would continue to prep up the old suitcase trick. This time, Akio had collected a few spare bricks, in case he missed.
[21:05:23] Akio Mishima: /me would casually cozy up in the old corner, just watching the camera south.
[21:07:15] Akio Mishima: Oh, check it out!
[21:07:18] CPT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: What?
[21:07:24] Akio Mishima: I know you guys.

[21:07:38] CPT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: Yep
[21:07:47] Akio Mishima: What're you doing in this area?
[21:08:06] CPT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: Conscripts are general defense units, i'm allowed to guard the Nexus.
[21:08:11] Akio Mishima: Oh, are you?
[21:08:18] Akio Mishima: Do you have an Army rank, or something like that?
[21:08:25] CPT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: Yeah, Captain.
[21:08:29] Akio Mishima: Interesting.

[21:09:31] CPT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: Yep, currently we're in a bit of a "reform" so we'll call for applications once we get back on our feet.
[21:09:44] CPT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: Nothing serious, just a small policy change and what not.
[21:09:46] Akio Mishima: Makes sense, makes sense...
[21:09:56] Akio Mishima: Don't want to cause more troubles in the bureaucracy, I get it.
[21:10:00] CPT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: Yep
[21:10:03] Akio Mishima: I'll be moving on now, but take care, yes?

[21:11:20] Akio Mishima: Time to read the menu, I suppose.
[21:11:23] Erwin Ramstein: It is infact the Ramsteins.
[21:11:37] Erwin Ramstein: Welp there's Four Menus here.. These are supplies I've *ordered* I do-not currently have them on hand.

[21:13:16] Akio Mishima: He's going to sell it to you for good behavior.
[21:13:27] Erwin Ramstein: No, all for good reason. I picked this place because it's somewhat-safer then other sects.

[21:25:37] Akio Mishima: I saw it in action, it was quite crazy.
[21:25:37] CPT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: What in the fuck have rebels come to.
[21:25:40] Erwin Ramstein: Oh you think it'd be funny but keep one thing in mind.
[21:25:44] Akio Mishima: Sneak-attacks, friend!
[21:25:46] Akio Mishima: They are ninja.
[21:25:47] Erwin Ramstein: Those helmet's the CPs wear are *plastic*.
[21:25:49] CPT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: I remember when it just used to be guns or knives.
[21:25:55] Olivia Ramstein: Seems they've come to 'briefcase full of rocks'.
[21:25:57] Erwin Ramstein: Not going to do much against..
[21:26:00] Akio Mishima: Plastic?

[21:26:41] Olivia Ramstein: Wipe your mouth, thats nasty.
[21:26:44] CPT Mitchell 'Lazzy' Lazarus: That is funny as hell.
[21:26:47] Akio Mishima: .// I VOIDED IT
[21:26:47] Erwin Ramstein: But the thing is, you need gravity to help you with it.
[21:26:54] Erwin Ramstein: Cause you cannot just lunge that thing around

[21:48:12] Akio Mishima: Simple.

[21:48:20] Akio Mishima: How much do YOU have?
[21:48:22] Erwin Ramstein: Price Margines will be.. *Small*.

[21:48:40] Erwin Ramstein: Not looking to get a crazy amount of money, if it does come up, I'd love an excess of Tokens.
[21:48:50] Akio Mishima: Crazy amount of money?
[21:48:54] Erwin Ramstein: But if I'm to be honest I just want to cook and give people an area to refuge in.
[21:48:59] Akio Mishima: What else is there to do in this world other than satisfy your insatiable lust for money and power

[21:51:33] Erwin Ramstein: Curry.. Alright.
[21:51:34] Akio Mishima: And you can brew it in a giant pot.
[21:51:36] Erwin Ramstein: And yeah, right.
[21:51:40] Olivia Ramstein: You should get red peppers, they taste good.
[21:51:42] Akio Mishima: Just put it on chicken, beef, rice, vegetables, ANYTHING.

[22:18:04] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Now, let's go back in time to before the war.
[22:18:04] Olivia Ramstein: I'll sell some for two!
[22:18:08] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: As much as some people would hate to.
[22:18:16] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: A bag of chips in Colombia was..Quite a few pesos.
[22:18:19] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Hmm-
[22:18:28] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: /me would put his hands on the counter. The Civil Protection unit was obviously deep in thought.
[22:18:37] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Eh.
[22:18:45] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: What I'm payin'll be a bit more, but that's for you to keep.
[22:18:50] Erwin Ramstein: If I might add, Cheese is not an easy resource to acquire compared to the Old World.
[22:18:54] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: What am I gonna spend all this money on anyways? A night at the bloody bar?
[22:19:10] Erwin Ramstein: Well, this is a bar as well so evidently feel free.
[22:19:16] Erwin Ramstein: Heard Absinthe and Cheese goes well
[22:19:21] Erwin Ramstein: We also have Bread n' Butter.
[22:19:25] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Absinthe and Cheese?
[22:19:29] Simon Amsterdam: /it Erwins bar was not bloody, it was clean
[22:19:32] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Citizen, I'm a civil protection officer, not Vincent Van Gogh.
[22:19:35] Erwin Ramstein: Absinthe it's like a *fancy wine*. 
[22:19:43] Erwin Ramstein: Fine, then a damn Beer and Cheese.
[22:19:52] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Now you're talking.
[22:19:57] Erwin Ramstein: Right-on.
[22:20:06] Simon Amsterdam: /looc absinthe and cheese alone in your apartment is depressing as shit lol
[22:20:07] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: I'll order it ahead of time, for when it arrives.
[22:20:11] Erwin Ramstein: .// LMFAO
[22:20:16] Erwin Ramstein: .// The Half Life experience.
[22:20:20] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: .// Imagine the lonely CP unit just eating it on his barracks bed.
[22:20:24] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: .// Sniffling as he grabs clumps of cheese
[22:20:27] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: .// and shoves it into his mouth
[22:20:29] Simon Amsterdam: /looc yes lol
[22:20:53] Erwin Ramstein: If you'd like to make a Twenty-Five Token Down-Payment, I'll alert you if its anymore then that when it arrives, if not. You get yourself a Prime Well-Conditioned Cheese Wheel. UU Stamped and Authorized.
[22:21:02] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Did we not speak to each other before, Citizen?
[22:21:06] Erwin Ramstein: I can also, make something out of a bit of it if you'd like.
[22:21:06] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Erwin Ramstein, am I correct?
[22:21:14] Erwin Ramstein: Yeah, Erwin Ramstein.
[22:21:20] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: The Boer?

[22:21:38] Erwin Ramstein: Yep.
[22:21:44] Erwin Ramstein: Which is nice.
[22:21:56] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: I can't remember much anymore, except for my duties.
[22:22:00] Erwin Ramstein: But hey, Like I said. You can just *have* the Cheese Wheel surely but I could always make you something with it.
[22:22:00] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: But that's all I have to say on the matter.
[22:22:08] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Eh, sure, why not.
[22:22:11] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: I'll order a whole dinner in advance.

[22:22:43] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Do you know how to make a tortilla?
[22:22:47] Erwin Ramstein: Except that I don't have any Potatoes sadly..
[22:22:53] Erwin Ramstein: Tortilla... Corn? Right?
[22:22:59] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Flour is easier to get, these days.
[22:23:00] Erwin Ramstein: Let me see here..
[22:23:04] Erwin Ramstein: I got..
[22:23:11] Erwin Ramstein: Corn on a Cob, I can turn that into Corn Flour.
[22:23:15] Erwin Ramstein: So yeah that's do-able/
[22:23:29] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: You should make burritos.
[22:23:33] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Easy street food.
[22:23:36] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Hell, I could teach you.

[22:24:23] Simon Amsterdam: /it Simon's filter is unscrewed
[22:24:27] Erwin Ramstein: So I can make, plenty of Flour.
[22:24:37] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Why don't you two take your hazmat suits off?
[22:24:37] Simon Amsterdam: it feels like a part of my body now, I like to keep it on
[22:24:39] Erwin Ramstein: Also the Old Man's Comfortable with his suit on.
[22:24:41] Erwin Ramstein: It's mighty cold.
[22:24:46] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: We'll choke if we take them off.
[22:24:51] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Look at these two.
[22:24:52] Erwin Ramstein: Not here you wont, Friend.
[22:24:53] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: They're not choking.
[22:24:58] Erwin Ramstein: Air Filters, installed inside and outside.
[22:25:00] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: You're  near an air-pump, besides.
[22:25:02] Erwin Ramstein: For your dining and comfort.
[22:25:07] Erwin Ramstein: Purified, Fresh Air.
[22:25:09] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: The weather's acting finnicky, and the smog has temporarily cleared for now.
[22:25:20] Magistrate 'Aratakrast' the Fourth: Good to know.
[22:25:22] Erwin Ramstein: And when it comes back, this area will be a haven of purity.
[22:25:25] Erwin Ramstein: Another plus.
[22:25:28] Simon Amsterdam: /it "I like to have it on" the old man mumbles to himself
[22:25:38] Erwin Ramstein: But yeah, no.
[22:25:39] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: That's-
[22:25:43] Erwin Ramstein: I can totally make uh
[22:25:44] Simon Amsterdam: /it its very unnerving to hear him say that
[22:25:46] Erwin Ramstein: Some kind of Corn Flour,
[22:25:53] Erwin Ramstein: And defenitely order some kind of.. I dunno.
[22:25:54] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: /me would just shake his head, "Eh."
[22:25:55] Erwin Ramstein: Wheat Flour.
[22:26:13] Simon Amsterdam: /looc my guy is basically a living corpse at this point
[22:26:22] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: .// he should record a black metal album
[22:26:30] Erwin Ramstein: I also have some more.. Unique Items!

[22:26:40] Erwin Ramstein: Compared to.. Nutrient Paste.
[22:26:45] Erwin Ramstein: Yessir.
[22:26:47] Erwin Ramstein: Pineapples.
[22:26:49] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: How the Hell do you get pineapples?

[22:27:55] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Get plenty of hot-sauces.
[22:28:01] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: I say, /plenty./
[22:28:07] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: If you do, I will come here every single damn day.

[22:28:18] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Oh, no, trust me.
[22:28:21] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: You could make your own hot-sauce.
[22:28:22] Erwin Ramstein: Tomorrow I'll extend to a Second Order after recieving my first.
[22:28:30] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: That makes it special.
[22:28:34] Erwin Ramstein: Yeah, someone suggested making a Curry Sauce, and I already planned on Chili.
[22:28:42] Erwin Ramstein: I'll be getting some Bell Peppers next order, hopefully.
[22:28:44] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: You have to make simple, street foods.
[22:28:49] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Stuff you can assemble very quickly.
[22:28:59] Erwin Ramstein: That will certaintly be a part of the entree's.
[22:29:08] Erwin Ramstein: I work in every degree for every niche.
[22:29:15] Erwin Ramstein: Breakfast to Dessert.
[22:29:28] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Finally, a Civil Worker with a spine.
[22:29:29] Simon Amsterdam: /me quickly turns his head as if reacting to something unseen, and shuffles off without a word
[22:29:36] Erwin Ramstein: I just like cookin' food.
[22:29:43] Erwin Ramstein: And if I make a profit off of it that's nice too.
[22:29:50] Erwin Ramstein: If not, still cookin' and helping people out.
[22:29:55] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: In the last city I was at, the Civil workers started to stutter like whelps when they even thought of ordering something out of the ordinary.
[22:29:59] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Good on you.
[22:30:11] Erwin Ramstein: Cheers.
[22:30:15] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: I just want some good tasting food, I haven't had any in a year.
[22:30:26] Erwin Ramstein: Yeah.. I got some spice of life flavors..
[22:30:31] Erwin Ramstein: Pineapple for a real sweet taste
[22:30:35] Erwin Ramstein: I got Pickles comin' in
[22:30:38] Erwin Ramstein: For a nice Vinegar.
[22:30:42] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: You know that old man?
[22:30:50] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Looked very sick he did, didn't he?
[22:30:52] Erwin Ramstein: Simon, yeah. He worked with me last Workshift.
[22:30:56] Erwin Ramstein: He's just old and tired.
[22:31:01] Erwin Ramstein: Works himself half to death for LP
[22:31:06] Erwin Ramstein: Cause they keep taking away his CWU
[22:31:09] Erwin Ramstein: It's.. disgusting.
[22:31:14] Erwin Ramstein: He's earned it so many times.
[22:31:17] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Ugh...
[22:31:20] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: You mind if I come in?
[22:31:25] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: I need a damn chair, if anything.
[22:31:26] Erwin Ramstein: Poor guy gets made fun of by the CP's 
[22:31:40] Erwin Ramstein: Oh sure, there's seats outside and a couch that's rather comfy by the front door.
[22:31:51] Erwin Ramstein: I actually don't got a chair inside.
[22:31:56] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: I'll sit by the wall then.
[22:32:05] Erwin Ramstein: Sure, let me go open the door.
[22:32:21] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: /me would casually walk over, the Civil Protection unit was trying hard to keep his posture outward, and his effort showed.
[22:32:28] Erwin Ramstein: /me *the man would open the door in a welcoming manner.*

[22:32:56] Erwin Ramstein: .// It was my idea to make this into a bedroom
[22:33:02] Erwin Ramstein: Yep. Rather Make-Shift.
[22:33:07] Erwin Ramstein: The whole place it but hey, I make do.
[22:33:12] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: You're gonna need some proper wall painting, atleast.
[22:33:16] Olivia Ramstein: It's got a vent over it though. Nicer than most places.
[22:33:26] Olivia Ramstein: Most of the time you just wake up choking.
[22:33:26] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: I have a real, serious question.
[22:33:29] Erwin Ramstein: Yeah.. Gonna get rid of the Grafitti soon.. get a nice carpet.
[22:33:36] Erwin Ramstein: But the Purified air is amazing
[22:33:45] Erwin Ramstein: /me *he'd point to a small Car-Aromatic*
[22:33:49] Erwin Ramstein: Even made it smell nice.
[22:33:52] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: /me would simply give a small stretch. The Civil Protection officer had genuinely uncomfortable movements, as he turned his radio off.
[22:34:03] Erwin Ramstein: Question-away.
[22:34:08] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: How the Hell do you guys stand it?
[22:34:17] Erwin Ramstein: Stand "It"?
[22:34:25] Erwin Ramstein: As-innnn..
[22:34:25] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: This..This thing.
[22:34:28] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Our world, as it is.
[22:34:30] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Daily life.
[22:34:32] Erwin Ramstein: Oh, I mean.
[22:34:36] Erwin Ramstein: I wont speak for her.
[22:34:41] Erwin Ramstein: But I don't really, stand it.
[22:34:43] Erwin Ramstein: It just.. is what it is.
[22:34:54] Erwin Ramstein: I'm hopeful the Union will make things better.
[22:35:00] Erwin Ramstein: But I've heard.. Terrible things from other Cities..
[22:35:08] Erwin Ramstein: And City-17.. It isn't paradise.
[22:35:20] Erwin Ramstein: Saddening, but. I like to stay hopeful.
[22:35:32] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: /me would simply look around. The man wasn't obviously feeling the most well, and would simply lean on the wall behind him.
[22:35:45] Erwin Ramstein: You uh, you alright?
[22:35:51] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Yeah, I'm doing fine.
[22:36:00] Erwin Ramstein: That isn't exactly a question I hear CP's asking, at all.
[22:36:00] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: It's just..These days get longer, you know.
[22:36:08] Erwin Ramstein: I can only imagine in a position like yours.
[22:36:14] Erwin Ramstein: You've made yourself quite the target.
[22:36:23] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: You have to, when you're low on the food chain.
[22:36:25] Olivia Ramstein: Suitcase full of rocks..
[22:36:32] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: It gets you promoted quicker. Bigger bonus, more food, more pay.
[22:36:34] Erwin Ramstein: Tell me about it.
[22:36:51] Erwin Ramstein: I'm doing this to support myself and my peers, and hoping that the Union will improve things further.
[22:37:06] Erwin Ramstein: The whole reason I opened this Diner today was to given people some glimpse of.. Normality.
[22:37:14] Erwin Ramstein: Enjoying a Hot Meal for once.
[22:37:23] Erwin Ramstein: Relaxing.
[22:37:24] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Haven't had that in three years, now have we?
[22:37:30] Erwin Ramstein: Longer then that.

[22:37:37] Erwin Ramstein: Least it'd feel that way.
[22:37:44] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Yeah..The Portal storms began, what,
[22:37:49] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: '98, atleast?
[22:37:58] Erwin Ramstein: And they haven't been around too much...
[22:38:04] Erwin Ramstein: I guess that's something to thank the union for.
[22:38:19] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Order over chaos, that's how the world works, Erwin.
[22:38:26] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Atleast, that's what they say.
[22:38:31] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: It's always a fluctuation of the two.
[22:38:32] Erwin Ramstein: Well this is, one helluva Order.
[22:38:41] Olivia Ramstein: Laws of entropy be damned..
[22:38:47] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Eh, you think?
[22:38:55] BUSH WOOKIE<STEAM_0:1:73051733> changed their name to Marcus Fleming
[22:39:00] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: It always plagues my mind, the 'if's.
[22:39:14] Erwin Ramstein: The 'Ifs' right now are three things.
[22:39:28] Erwin Ramstein: One, we're being used and will be abandoned by this Super-Colony in the near future.
[22:39:44] Erwin Ramstein: Two, they actually plan to ring us in to their conglomerate, and we can one day go back to normal enjoyable life.
[22:39:48] Erwin Ramstein: Three, Rebellion.
[22:39:54] Erwin Ramstein: And then.. Praying.
[22:40:04] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: And with all of Earth falling in seven hours, would the third option even be possible..?
[22:40:11] Dropped "Marcus Fleming" from server<STEAM_0:1:73051733>
[22:40:18] Olivia Ramstein: They try.
[22:40:19] Erwin Ramstein: The Earth fell because it was caught with its pants not only down, but off entirely.
[22:40:32] Erwin Ramstein: The One thing that Human's are known for, is that they do not like being Ruled.
[22:40:40] Erwin Ramstein: Especially by a Foreign Power.
[22:40:43] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Good point...
[22:40:52] Erwin Ramstein: People will fight, for their lives, for their Families. For their Gods.
[22:40:55] Erwin Ramstein: For their Home.
[22:41:05] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Whatever home that may be, now that we're all in the diaspora.
[22:41:06] Erwin Ramstein: Our Home, our Great Green Globe has been turned into a Toxic Cesspit.
[22:41:23] Erwin Ramstein: And there are some very, very bright minds out their that im sure are ready at any moment to begin toppling the Union.
[22:41:35] Erwin Ramstein: And I am sure that with enough push, they *can*
[22:41:37] Erwin Ramstein: But then what?
[22:41:44] Erwin Ramstein: They'll come back eventually.
[22:41:50] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Maybe, but-
[22:41:50] Erwin Ramstein: How the hell would we fend off that.
[22:41:59] Olivia Ramstein: Maybe it's all pointless.
[22:41:59] Erwin Ramstein: What they sent here was just a Scouting Party.
[22:42:01] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: /me would look to the woman, who he didn't know, "Didn't you say something about entropy?"
[22:42:34] Olivia Ramstein: The law of entropy. Without work, order turns to chaos.
[22:42:38] Olivia Ramstein: Despite work, sometimes.
[22:42:50] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: When a bunch of people have nothing to do, except walk around and get beat..
[22:42:52] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Yeah..
[22:43:17] Erwin Ramstein: Walk Around, Choke on the Stench and Fumes of Corroded Air, Get Beaten off the Head or even Killed just for Saying or Doing a Slight-Missup.
[22:43:29] Erwin Ramstein: Pledge either Loyalty, or Death to a Single Body.
[22:43:33] Erwin Ramstein: People, get angry.
[22:43:37] Erwin Ramstein: They get very angry.
[22:43:42] Erwin Ramstein: So angry they could kill a *God*.
[22:43:46] Erwin Ramstein: ...And they will.
[22:43:49] Erwin Ramstein: Soon.
[22:43:55] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: /me would continue to lean more of his body on the wall. The Unit folded his arms, his index finger scantly tapping up and down from time to time.
[22:43:58] Erwin Ramstein: If the Union doesn't really improve things.
[22:44:02] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: You sound optimistic.
[22:44:03] Erwin Ramstein: The God will Fall.
[22:44:06] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: But you know what scares me the most?
[22:44:08] Erwin Ramstein: It could go either way.
[22:44:18] Erwin Ramstein: I just hope that, *whatever happens.*
[22:44:20] Erwin Ramstein: Benefits us!
[22:44:23] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Mhm.
[22:44:24] Erwin Ramstein: For Heaven's sakes.
[22:44:33] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: The thought of total enslavement haunts me.
[22:44:38] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: You know what Unionwashing is?
[22:44:46] Erwin Ramstein: We're already in Total Enslavement.
[22:44:50] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Nono, Erwin.
[22:44:52] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: No, we aren't.
[22:44:58] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: You can still think against the Union. Billions of people can.
[22:45:05] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: /actlean
[22:45:05] Erwin Ramstein: Not for long.
[22:45:09] Erwin Ramstein: The Water.
[22:45:19] Erwin Ramstein: Every day I forget more and more about my Home.
[22:45:26] Erwin Ramstein: Every day, I drink from those Can's.
[22:45:31] Erwin Ramstein: Odd, isn't it?
[22:45:35] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: You don't boil your water?
[22:45:47] Erwin Ramstein: Of course not, if I was seen doing that I'd be stripped of everything.
[22:45:55] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: You have a stove here..
[22:46:00] Erwin Ramstein: Out in the open.
[22:46:03] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: You could just make it look like you were preparing food.
[22:46:08] Erwin Ramstein: Maybe.
[22:46:20] Erwin Ramstein: I haven't been *Guzzling* water. Not like I could even if I tried.
[22:46:26] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Mhm.
[22:46:28] Erwin Ramstein: First thing I'm doing when this is all over?
[22:46:31] Erwin Ramstein: Having a damn kid.
[22:46:35] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Oh yeah?
[22:46:46] Erwin Ramstein: That's the biggest thing I don't get.
[22:46:49] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Not going on a drinking spree, passing out in the middle of the Nexus floor?
[22:46:59] Erwin Ramstein: Took away our damn Gametes.
[22:47:14] Erwin Ramstein: I was at this real fancy Cafe once.
[22:47:17] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Yeah?
[22:47:25] Erwin Ramstein: Heard from a bunch of Purple-Armband Loyalists that once you reach Blue Tier you get..
[22:47:34] Erwin Ramstein: *Reproductive* Opportunities.
[22:47:40] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: You get to get it back up again?
[22:47:40] Erwin Ramstein: It's a Tier thing now.
[22:47:46] Erwin Ramstein: Yup.
[22:47:49] Erwin Ramstein: Can't believe that.
[22:48:04] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Virtual simulations, now those are *something*.
[22:48:19] Erwin Ramstein: Never thought V-R would become a real thing.
[22:48:28] Erwin Ramstein: Guess the Union has its ways of, introducing us into new Techs.
[22:48:37] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: If you do exemplary performance, you can get access to virtual stimulation.
[22:48:47] Erwin Ramstein: *yikes*
[22:48:48] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: It's exactly what it sounds like.
[22:48:50] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Atleast, that's what I've heard.
[22:49:01] Erwin Ramstein: Interesting Reward for CPs to get.
[22:49:09] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Sex and violence go together, Erwin.
[22:49:15] Erwin Ramstein: Sadly, for some.
[22:49:22] Erwin Ramstein: Maybe thats why they took it away.
[22:49:29] Erwin Ramstein: For barbaric comparisons such as that.
[22:49:36] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Oh, definitely.
[22:49:41] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: It's a temptation.
[22:49:45] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Just another thing that makes us happy.
[22:50:01] Erwin Ramstein: Just wish everyone could have some damn boundaries and understand romance n' emotions
[22:50:06] Erwin Ramstein: Some people just don't get it.
[22:50:10] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Oh?
[22:50:10] Erwin Ramstein: Or physically can't, get it.
[22:50:32] Erwin Ramstein: Union probably see's us all as a bunch of Sociopaths to herd.
[22:50:46] Erwin Ramstein: And I don't entirely blame them for that perspective.
[22:50:50] Erwin Ramstein: So many humans are just..
[22:50:53] Erwin Ramstein: Pieces of Shit?
[22:51:00] Erwin Ramstein: Not many other ways to word it.
[22:51:09] Erwin Ramstein: All of us are in our own ways sure, all of us fuckin' suck.
[22:51:12] Erwin Ramstein: But some people.
[22:51:12] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: We're probably the only planet that they can recruit the native population from, to oppress itself.
[22:51:16] Erwin Ramstein: some people *really* suck.
[22:51:30] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: I doubt other species would do such things.
[22:51:33] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: No, we're the special ones.
[22:51:40] Erwin Ramstein: Oh yeah, real *Special*.
[22:51:51] Erwin Ramstein: 'Cause we're tainted by Lucifer.
[22:51:51] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Hnn..
[22:52:15] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: /me would let out a long sigh, as he pushed himself off of the wall, standing, leaning on his left foot.
[22:52:17] Erwin Ramstein: Demon's Temptations and Attractions to Discorrd have been rooted into our Simplistic Minds for Eons.
[22:52:29] Erwin Ramstein: No one can just, *live*
[22:52:34] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: You see it that way, miss?
[22:52:40] Erwin Ramstein: Even the Happiest Man on Earth will get mad in once.
[22:52:51] Olivia Ramstein: I'm not sure how people work.
[22:52:51] Erwin Ramstein: Everyone has something to complain about.
[22:52:55] Olivia Ramstein: I don't know why they do what they do.,
[22:53:02] Olivia Ramstein: It's rarely good.
[22:53:02] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Power, greed.
[22:53:05] Erwin Ramstein: *You're better off that way*.
[22:53:16] Erwin Ramstein: People feed off of *Sin* if they're unwise enough.
[22:53:29] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: /me would let out another long sigh.
[22:53:34] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Makes me want to volunteer to get brainwashed.
[22:53:45] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Maybe then, all these feelings'll stop fucking plaguing me.
[22:53:56] Olivia Ramstein: Sounds worse than death.
[22:54:03] Erwin Ramstein: No amount of Physical-Mutilation will torment you away from your Soul, friend.
[22:54:12] Erwin Ramstein: The Christ protects you and gifts you with a promise of Salvation.
[22:54:23] Erwin Ramstein: But Lucifer will haunt you until you reach the Great Kingdom of our Lord.
[22:54:28] Erwin Ramstein: Mindwashed or Not.
[22:54:36] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: I never cared for the bible, though my abuelita always tried to teach me verses.
[22:54:36] Erwin Ramstein: The Spirit is Seperate from the Mind.
[22:54:40] Olivia Ramstein: Why'd God make these fuckers and send them here, then.
[22:54:44] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Now, I want to read it more than ever.
[22:54:52] Erwin Ramstein: Maybe God *didn't* make them.
[22:54:52] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: ...The greatest challenge yet?
[22:55:03] Olivia Ramstein: Hm.
[22:55:06] Erwin Ramstein: And if he did, there's a reason to it.
[22:55:13] Olivia Ramstein: Can't imagine it.
[22:55:15] Erwin Ramstein: There will always be a Reason
[22:55:20] Erwin Ramstein: Maybe this, is the Rapture?
[22:55:23] Erwin Ramstein: Maybe it already happened.
[22:55:31] Erwin Ramstein: This is the great river of fire.
[22:55:32] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Maybe we're just the damned?
[22:55:39] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Explains the lack of rebellion.
[22:55:39] Erwin Ramstein: We're all damned right now.
[22:55:50] Erwin Ramstein: My advise?
[22:55:55] Erwin Ramstein: Start remembering those Verses.
[22:56:02] Erwin Ramstein: Jesus Christ will judge you when you pass.
[22:56:14] Erwin Ramstein: Do good things in life.
[22:56:14] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: The only one I remember is the one in Leviticus, about how being with men is bad.
[22:56:26] Erwin Ramstein: Just because Jesus will allow Sin to pass, doesn't mean it should be done.
[22:56:39] Erwin Ramstein: Rules are Set to be followed yet expected to be broken.
[22:56:55] Olivia Ramstein: I'd focus less on not being gay, and more on.. I dunno, not killing people? 
[22:56:59] Erwin Ramstein: Ah, from the Old Testament is it not? Popular in many Baptists Churches.
[22:57:11] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: It was a bit of a joke, to be fair.
[22:57:16] Erwin Ramstein: I've never much understood it, primarily from the aim of our lord Christ.
[22:57:21] Olivia Ramstein: Not great with those either. Sorry.
[22:57:26] Erwin Ramstein: The man was very accepting.
[22:57:48] Erwin Ramstein: I prefer to try to not joke about the Lord.
[22:57:55] Erwin Ramstein: You want a joke, to tell Christ?
[22:58:03] Erwin Ramstein: *Show him what's been done to his greatest Creation.*
[22:58:09] Erwin Ramstein: *Show him the corruption its rought.*
[22:58:17] Erwin Ramstein: *Show him his most Beautiful Planet*
[22:58:18] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: This took a surprisingly religious turn.
[22:58:21] Erwin Ramstein: *Dying*
[22:58:23] Olivia Ramstein: I'm sure he already knows.
[22:58:25] Erwin Ramstein: *Covered in Smog, and Death*
[22:58:28] Olivia Ramstein: I just wonder if he cares.
[22:58:30] Erwin Ramstein: Thats, a good joke.
[22:58:37] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: He's waiting for us to care.
[22:58:43] Erwin Ramstein: Maybe.
[22:58:44] Olivia Ramstein: We can barely eat.
[22:58:44] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: I mean, look at me.
[22:58:55] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Look what I did, just for the benefits it brought.
[22:59:00] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: I'm not even known by my name anymore.
[22:59:06] Erwin Ramstein: The Union may be able to pull us out of this Hole.
[22:59:15] Erwin Ramstein: It's why I've become a part of the CWU.
[22:59:21] Erwin Ramstein: I have faith in the Institution.
[22:59:23] Olivia Ramstein: A unified government was one of the signs of the end times.
[22:59:27] Erwin Ramstein: Some of its Methods are.. terrible to me.
[22:59:31] Olivia Ramstein: It's said that it would be led by the antichrist.
[22:59:35] Erwin Ramstein: But that's just the thing.
[22:59:41] Erwin Ramstein: This isn't a Unified Government.
[22:59:42] Olivia Ramstein: The antichrist would die by assasination, a head wound.
[22:59:45] Olivia Ramstein: And be revived.
[22:59:50] Erwin Ramstein: As much as they want to call themselves a *Union*
[22:59:55] Erwin Ramstein: There's another name
[22:59:58] Erwin Ramstein: Echoed through the Sewers
[23:00:00] Erwin Ramstein: *Combine*
[23:00:04] Erwin Ramstein: They don't, Unify.
[23:00:08] Erwin Ramstein: They Force things together.
[23:00:10] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: They assimilate.
[23:00:12] Erwin Ramstein: Clash them intwined.
[23:00:19] Erwin Ramstein: Assimilation to the highest pedigree.
[23:00:23] Erwin Ramstein: This is no Unification.
[23:00:29] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Were you a preacher, or a philosopher before all this shit happened, Erwin?
[23:00:30] Erwin Ramstein: And the Leader of them is not loved by all.
[23:00:32] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: It sounds like you were.
[23:00:36] Erwin Ramstein: No, just a Farmer.
[23:00:36] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Or atleast, you would've made a good one.
[23:00:38] Olivia Ramstein: Literally Frankensteining things together in hopes it works out.
[23:00:45] Erwin Ramstein: Quite literally, yes.
[23:00:54] Erwin Ramstein: The Antichrist is loved by all, outright.
[23:00:56] Erwin Ramstein: I can tell you.
[23:00:59] Erwin Ramstein: Many hate the Consul.
[23:01:08] Olivia Ramstein: They're not supposed to.
[23:01:17] Olivia Ramstein: Not *everybody* loves them.
[23:01:27] Olivia Ramstein: Those who don't recieve the mark..
[23:01:34] Olivia Ramstein: Don't recieve the benifits.
[23:01:49] Olivia Ramstein: There are rebels, against the anti-christ.
[23:02:04] Erwin Ramstein: That Mark.. Of Mindwiping.
[23:02:05] Olivia Ramstein: But once the devil is in him, only God can cast him to the firey depths.
[23:02:18] Erwin Ramstein: The Benefits of being ignorant to the Truth of our own History and Faith.
[23:02:25] Erwin Ramstein: The Denial to Religion, any Religion.
[23:02:29] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: You know where I could find a Bible?
[23:02:30] Olivia Ramstein: Oh god this is the rapture, either there's no predetermination, or god has abandoned us.
[23:02:35] Erwin Ramstein: That Mindwiping.. is the *Mark.*
[23:02:44] Erwin Ramstein: The Mark of the Devil.
[23:02:49] Olivia Ramstein: The mark of the Beast.
[23:02:59] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: So Our Benefactors are the Beast?
[23:03:03] Olivia Ramstein: Indeed.
[23:03:05] Erwin Ramstein: Not them, no.
[23:03:14] Erwin Ramstein: They influence the Beast. Coerce it.
[23:03:19] Erwin Ramstein: The beast.. is.. and always will be.
[23:03:21] Erwin Ramstein: *Us*
[23:03:34] Erwin Ramstein: We must have the will to resist Lucifer.
[23:03:45] Erwin Ramstein: Without the power of god we fall to ignorance.
[23:03:51] Erwin Ramstein: And the Mindwipe is Ignorance Incarnate.
[23:04:02] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Gah..I can't listen to this anymore.
[23:04:08] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: It's too overwhelming
[23:04:15] Erwin Ramstein: Most talks of the Bible is
[23:04:26] Erwin Ramstein: Imagine having to decipher messages from the creator of everything ever
[23:04:29] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: I'm going to go. Barracks closes shortly as it is.
[23:04:32] Erwin Ramstein: As a Super-Evolved Monkey.
[23:04:35] Erwin Ramstein: Not an easy task.
[23:04:36] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: If I don't arrive, I'm a dead man.
[23:04:43] Olivia Ramstein: You should hurry, then.
[23:04:53] Erwin Ramstein: Well, get on your way. I'll keep you posted on the.. Cheese..
[23:04:56] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: I'll see you two, and sheesh-Thank you, atleast.
[23:04:59] Erwin Ramstein: I really hope the Union does some good.
[23:05:05] Erwin Ramstein: I hope.. I'm wrong.
[23:05:07] Erwin Ramstein: I really do.
[23:05:12] Olivia Ramstein: I don't see any other way.
[23:05:13] Erwin Ramstein: We should never predict the Rapture.
[23:05:15] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: /me would quickly turn on his radio. The Unit still rubbed the outside of his face-mask, as he looked toward them.
[23:05:15] Erwin Ramstein: 'tis a Sin.
[23:05:19] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Anywho.
[23:05:23] Erwin Ramstein: Well Officer,
[23:05:26] Erwin Ramstein: I'm glad everything checks out!
[23:05:32] Erwin Ramstein: You have a nice day.
[23:05:33] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: /me would look over, to the lady he hadn't been introduced.
[23:05:39] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: What's your name, Civil Worker?
[23:05:48] Olivia Ramstein: Olivia, Ramstein.
[23:05:54] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Ramstein, are you two related?
[23:06:12] Erwin Ramstein: We have the same last name which is neat.
[23:06:17] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: What a coincidence.
[23:06:20] Erwin Ramstein: Beyond that I don't believe so.
[23:06:26] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: Well, I'll see you two. Good luck, sincerely.
[23:06:29] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: ...With your business and whatnot.
[23:06:37] Erwin Ramstein: Good luck to you as well, check for Briefcases.
[23:06:46] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: /me would then exit through the door, the CP having a steady gait, moreso than when he last walked.
[23:06:48] Olivia Ramstein: Don't get your head knocked off.
