[09:28:12] Akio Mishima: /me would rather casually walk over, the young, delinquent-looking man just snickering at the man's wearing of the suit.
[09:28:16] Akio Mishima: Why you wearing suit, ey?
[09:28:19] Akio Mishima: You scared of good air?
[09:28:29] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: I like my identity.
[09:28:35] Akio Mishima: Psh, look around, friend!
[09:28:40] Akio Mishima: Air is pretty clean, must be weather phenomena.
[09:28:46] Akio Mishima: Happens once a year, probably.
[09:28:56] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: Have you seen the sky?
[09:29:12] Akio Mishima: Yeah, pretty beautiful, what, you like looking up into the stars?
[09:29:16] Akio Mishima: Trying to find a better planet?
[09:29:31] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: You don't see the everglowing red hue in the sky?
[09:29:43] Akio Mishima: Everglowing red hue-
[09:29:55] Akio Mishima: /me would just turn up, snorting to himself as he looked down at the man.
[09:30:09] Akio Mishima: Oh, so you're scared of the supernatural?
[09:30:16] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: Did I say that?
[09:30:33] Akio Mishima: Sounded like it!
[09:31:06] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: I've seen the supernatural, this is just the fault of our atmosphere and the uncontrollable result of the recklessness of Combine Soldiers destroying the planet.
[09:31:10] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: Does that make sense?
[09:31:37] Akio Mishima: /me would just fold his arms. The man was obviously not entertained by the man's ranting. "And so you wear giant hazmat suit, even though FOR NOW, air is perfectly OK?"
[09:32:03] Akio Mishima: Instead of taking striking opportunity to breathe like a hidden tiger, you cower in your suit like white rabbit, who humans plan to eat for Lunch?!
[09:32:26] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: Where were you before all this?
[09:32:33] Akio Mishima: Where do you think? Here!
[09:32:54] Akio Mishima: They relocated me sev'ral times, but I lived in this city for my whole life.
[09:32:59] Akio Mishima: Before the War, and after.
[09:33:01] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: Perhaps the Japanese communism has taken a toll on your small brain
[09:33:12] Akio Mishima: Japanese Communism? What the fuck are you talking about?
[09:33:20] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: You don't know?
[09:33:31] Akio Mishima: No, I don't know what you're talking about!
[09:33:57] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: Perhaps, instead of surrounding yourself in the ego-inflating bubble of Japanese wealth and style, you should learn about your culture.
[09:34:05] Lee Maylor: //owdy
[09:34:06] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: The history of your plains.
[09:34:14] Lee Maylor: //i've got writing stuff to do
[09:34:23] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: // yee scallywag
[09:34:33] Akio Mishima: /me would just look dumbfounded. Akio obviously just let out a grown, "Holy shit, here we go again. Another Westerner who thinks he knows everything about our culture!"
[09:34:48] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: Westerner? Where do you think I'm from?
[09:35:07] Akio Mishima: Wait..
[09:35:11] Akio Mishima: I KNOW where you're from!
[09:35:17] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: Enlighten me.
[09:35:27] Akio Mishima: South Africa, no?
[09:35:53] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: You pay attention? I would've never thought.
[09:36:12] Akio Mishima: Of course!
[09:36:20] Akio Mishima: Feigning ignorance is the sign of true intelligence.
[09:36:31] Akio Mishima: Which, of course, your superiority complex would NEVER understand.
[09:36:49] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: Superiority complex? Hah, you are a man of funny jokes.

[09:38:46] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: But now we are stuck in this damned world with robots, aliens maybe.
[09:39:04] Akio Mishima: /me would just roll his eyes. The Asian man absolutely did not care for the man's blabbering, and to be honest, he thought it wasted time and money.
[09:39:15] Akio Mishima: How we've all wronged each other?
[09:39:22] Akio Mishima: What are you, an armchair philosopher?
[09:39:46] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: All the wars we've fought, for oil, land, resources, it all seems to be useless now, that the Combine control it all.
[09:40:00] Akio Mishima: Meh, you think too much.
[09:40:05] Akio Mishima: This world is very simple, friend. Very simple.

[09:41:41] Akio Mishima: You TRULY have a dizzying intellect.
[09:41:46] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: What's your view on this, than?
[09:41:52] Akio Mishima: My view?

[09:42:10] Akio Mishima: I love the Combine, I hate the Combine, I'm sexually attracted to the Combine- who the FUCK cares?
[09:42:12] Akio Mishima: Like, seriously.
[09:42:17] Akio Mishima: My view doesn't matter, and neither does yours.
[09:42:28] Akio Mishima: The only way we can make it matter  is if we become a cop, or we become a rebel.
[09:42:37] Akio Mishima: Not standing around on the streets like punks.
[09:43:20] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: Because being ignorant about how we need each other in this day in age is truly the first step to destroying your moral compass, and your life. We shouldn't be depending on neither Combine nor Rebel. Life before this was simple, and we had royalties.
[09:43:43] Akio Mishima: Life before this, SIMPLE?
[09:43:44] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: As small as said royalties may be, we still loved said privileges, but why take them away so soon?
[09:44:02] Akio Mishima: Maybe in Africa, it was simple, serene, but life before this in the West wasn't much different!
[09:44:37] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: Hah, Africa was - and still may be, a war lord country for blood hungry capitalists.
[09:44:49] Akio Mishima: Sounds like fun!
[09:44:56] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: It was, for the time being.
[09:45:04] Akio Mishima: Warlords, blood-hunger, is that not the human experience?
[09:45:06] Akio Mishima: I wish Japan could've had that!
[09:45:22] Akio Mishima: Instead, we get to be effeminate salaryman, go to 9-9 job, do work for your fucking foreign boss...
[09:45:25] Akio Mishima: Faggy shit!
[09:46:10] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: You seem to still be living in the 'Samurai age', with your odd philosophies one may rule you insane.
[09:46:25] Akio Mishima: Indeed I am, and I am proud of it, good friend!
[09:46:30] Akio Mishima: I just don't look it.
[09:46:37] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: Maybe you shall be amputated, than.
[09:46:43] Akio Mishima: Amputated?
[09:46:44] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: Combine don't like force.

[12:26:11] Ag'reil: .// i played on an old server that had its events based on the playerbase and what they'd do with it, I think with Q trying to incorporate the crazy supernatural feel to RP is kinda far-fetched for hl2rp like for example;

[12:27:58] Ag'reil: .// especially with how hes in college and probably crawling in debt, his best bet would be perfecting the server so that when someone joins, they can actually say, "wow, this is like other servers, why the hell isn't this popular"

[21:20:07] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.93963: 999 Had better ideas for self-sustainability than just charging forward.
