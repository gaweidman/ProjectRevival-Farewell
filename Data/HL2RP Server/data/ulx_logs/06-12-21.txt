[13:13:46] Erwin Ramstein: Thank you! Oil Lamps, quite high quality issued from the UU.
[13:13:58] Erwin Ramstein: If you'd like, you can view the Menus, if anything is of interest just alert me.
[13:14:16] Erwin Ramstein: Also, this area is Air Vented, Purified and Scented-Air all in this Lobby.
[13:14:24] Erwin Ramstein: Feel free to get into your Civvie's if youd like.
[13:14:41] Jonas McAlann: It is so reminiscent here.
[13:15:04] Jonas McAlann: Like.. old.
[13:15:51] Erwin Ramstein: *Yeah*... I've gone for a bit of a..
[13:15:56] Erwin Ramstein: Antique, yet Humble design.
[13:16:05] Erwin Ramstein: Just trying to make Citizens feel more, at home and relaxed.
[13:16:26] Erwin Ramstein: I don't have much but Money is beginning to flow, and I'm happy to provide for Citizens in need.
[13:16:42] Jonas McAlann: It is something different.
[13:16:45] Jonas McAlann: Is it not?
[13:16:52] Erwin Ramstein: It is indeed!
[13:16:58] Jonas McAlann: The feeling?
[13:17:12] Erwin Ramstein: To me, Warm. It's why I put it the Oil Lamps.
[13:17:26] Jonas McAlann: What about.. those lights?
[13:17:43] Jonas McAlann: Fimiliar, yet alien.
[13:17:54] Erwin Ramstein: Hm? What lights?
[13:17:58] Erwin Ramstein: /me *he'd peer over.*
[13:18:02] Erwin Ramstein: The Combine Ones?
[13:18:09] Erwin Ramstein: They're just, glorified flourescent lights.
[13:18:23] Jonas McAlann: What about what powers them? Is it not alien?
[13:18:50] Erwin Ramstein: Some kind of Battery, Combine Generators, most of the Energy they get in the City Sector is from Generators in the Warehouses and Sewers to my knowledge.
[13:18:58] Erwin Ramstein: But a lot of Energy comes from well, the Nexus.
[13:19:02] Erwin Ramstein: Not sure what it is though.
[13:19:14] Jonas McAlann: Nexus? Like a.. hivemind?
[13:19:45] Erwin Ramstein: ....*Yeah*.. Kind of? More like, the home of the Union in this Sector.
[13:20:14] Erwin Ramstein: It's where the CCA live when they're not patrolling, Officials of the Union's Administration also reside their, and in the Plaza of the Nexus is the CWU HQ.
[13:20:32] Erwin Ramstein: Where I appled for, well. *He'd point to his Orange Armband*; This.
[13:20:59] Jonas McAlann: But it is all so alien. To me.
[13:21:51] Erwin Ramstein: Well... They are Aliens.
[13:22:45] Jonas McAlann: It reminds me.. it is.. reminiscent.. of a foreign land, whereas they were once waging war with conviction..
[13:22:59] Jonas McAlann: I believe that is what this place reminds me of.. war.
[13:23:18] Erwin Ramstein: Odd environment to be reminded of. And yeah this is the uh, product of War I suppose. Still alive, so that's a start.
[13:24:10] Jonas McAlann: Have you ever been tired of war?
[13:24:37] Erwin Ramstein: Often, yeah. But right now things have been, rather peaceful. For the most part anyways.
[13:25:21] Jonas McAlann: Have you seen it?
[13:26:42] Erwin Ramstein: Have I seen, what.
[13:26:43] Erwin Ramstein: War?
[13:26:47] Jonas McAlann: Yes?
[13:26:55] Erwin Ramstein: I think we all saw the Seven-Hour War.
[13:26:58] Erwin Ramstein: So I mean, yeah.
[13:27:22] Jonas McAlann: Not that war, but one that is familiar?
[13:27:34] Erwin Ramstein: I remember seeing the Vietnam War on Television.
[13:27:44] Erwin Ramstein: I saw war where I lived in South Africa.
[13:27:46] Erwin Ramstein: Between Tribes
[13:27:49] Erwin Ramstein: Between Races.
[13:28:03] Jonas McAlann: But one of revenge?
[13:28:15] Jonas McAlann: And one for the fight of everyone's freedoms?
[13:28:19] Erwin Ramstein: All the Wars in South Africa were of Revenge, I fail to see your Point or Curiosity/
[13:29:09] Jonas McAlann: Simple skirmishes; a great war of expansion perhaps? And one of rearmament of a nation that was once prosperous?
[13:29:48] Jonas McAlann: So much of it, I had seen.. it tires me.
[13:30:00] Erwin Ramstein: Well, I suppose the comfort I can give you is there's.. No War here.
[13:30:05] Erwin Ramstein: Not that I've seen.
[13:30:13] Jonas McAlann: Do you FEEL it?
[13:30:44] Jonas McAlann: Better yet.. can you hear it? It is coming, methinks.
[13:31:43] Erwin Ramstein: Mm, I've heard of some.
[13:31:46] Erwin Ramstein: I guess you could say 
[13:31:48] Erwin Ramstein: Civil Unrest?
[13:31:59] Erwin Ramstein: A War? Not sure, but I have been getting an odd feeling/
[13:32:11] Erwin Ramstein: Regardless, I'm just here to Cook, and help people out.
[13:32:18] Erwin Ramstein: Make some money along the way and, enjoy myself.
[13:33:06] Jonas McAlann: A modest man, I assume of you.
[13:33:51] Jonas McAlann: Methinks I should get going now. I can hear something coming thataways.
