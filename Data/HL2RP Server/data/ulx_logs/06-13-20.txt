[00:00:12] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.98240 [X]: .// I feel you
[00:00:16] James Albright: .//it feels more immersive honestly
[00:00:35] James Albright: .//also having asshole characters comes naturally because i get stressed and it's a good outlet if i'm being honest
[00:00:53] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.98240 [X]: .// Lmao, Is that why you're GRID is so vulgar towards me?

[00:03:18] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.98240 [X]: .// The fact that he's rather kind to like Ethan but is mean to any unit is so fuckin funny to me.
[00:04:04] James Albright: .//to be fair he has to be nice to ethan or ethan will shut the fuck down
[00:04:17] James Albright: .//to the sectorial, ethan is the key to this whole fucking portal because he thinks the rebels caused the fuckin portal
[00:04:40] James Albright: .//so he wants to make him feel sepcial and comfortable so he can get all the info he can
[00:04:47] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.98240 [X]: .// Yeah I understand, Although Ethan doesn't know much about it so Ethans probably fucked.

[00:13:45] James Albright: .//from an OOC perspective, in the idea of the world, it makes sense why it exists
