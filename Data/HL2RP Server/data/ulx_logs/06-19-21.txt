[16:26:09] Cameron Nixon: Synth Studies.
[16:26:19] Victor: I know they already have those.
[16:26:26] Victor: Have you guys seen the uh... fuck's it called?
[16:26:35] Victor: Sentinels.
[16:26:38] Victor: You guys ever seen those?
[16:26:39] Cameron Nixon: Nope.
[16:26:45] John Smith: nah mate
[16:26:50] Victor: Good. Hope it stays that way.
[16:27:06] Victor: They're the only human synths I'm aware of. They're used to guard the sectorial, commander, all that.
[16:27:19] Victor: They're not to be messed with.

[16:27:52] Cameron Nixon: sO.
[16:27:56] Cameron Nixon: How are we getting in.

[16:31:18] Cameron Nixon: We're pretty close to the Factory.
[16:32:00] Cameron Nixon: All clear.. good
[16:33:25] Cameron Nixon: Vantage Point.
[16:33:41] Cameron Nixon: We're right outside.
[16:33:44] Cameron Nixon: Gates just out front.
[16:34:12] Cameron Nixon: This place is Solid Concrete.. less they have Explosives, or a Strider; we're in good Cover.

[16:34:40] Victor: damn
[16:34:46] Victor: that thing looks bad.
[16:34:54] Cameron Nixon: Well, yeah. It's a Synth Factory.
[16:34:59] Cameron Nixon: So what exactly is your idea to getting in.
[16:35:01] Victor: you get what I mean.
[16:35:12] Cameron Nixon: Cause all I see is a giant fucking gate.
[16:35:14] Victor: Well, depends on the security system. So far, though, seems like there's no security.
[16:35:27] Cameron Nixon: So?
[16:35:39] Victor: well, there's probably some kind of button
[16:35:40] Victor: I hope
[16:35:49] Victor: Only one way to find out.
[16:35:50] Cameron Nixon: Lets look for a button, then. 
[16:36:12] Victor: /toggleraise
[16:36:26] Victor: fuck.
[16:36:43] Victor: poor people.
[16:36:44] Cameron Nixon: Nothin, good cover though,

[16:36:52] Cameron Nixon: Alright, well.
[16:37:01] Cameron Nixon: That leaves
[16:37:05] Cameron Nixon: The Gate and the Building next to it.
[16:37:15] Victor: Yeah, let's go.
[16:37:45] Cameron Nixon: Do I?
[16:37:45] Victor: /toggleraise
[16:37:53] Victor: /toggleraise
[16:37:57] Victor: get behind cover, then yes.

[16:38:19] Victor: /toggleraise
[16:38:25] Victor: /toggleraise
[16:38:26] Cameron Nixon: Secondary Door of some sort.
[16:38:35] Victor: yeah
[16:38:37] Victor: Does it...
[16:38:44] Victor: /me tries to lift it up from the bottom with one hand.
[16:38:46] Victor: h
[16:38:51] Victor: .//Hmm.*
[16:39:01] Victor: Doesn't want to open.
[16:39:06] Victor: You, non-bug guy.
[16:39:07] Victor: Try it out.
[16:39:20] Cameron Nixon: In what way, there's no relative control but I could try shocking the door itself.
[16:39:32] John Smith: /me would attempt to left the door with both hands, and would fail.
[16:39:40] Victor: damn
[16:39:49] Victor: Maybe there's some kind of control somewhere else.
[16:39:53] Victor: I've seen a bit.
[16:40:27] Cameron Nixon: Well, we're covered in here.
[16:40:33] Victor: If anything, it might be some card.
[16:40:42] Victor: /toggleraise
[16:40:44] Cameron Nixon: Maybe try the datachip.
[16:40:56] Victor: Let's se...
[16:40:58] Victor: .//see...*
[16:41:12] John Smith: if that doesn't work, we can zap it with that bug of yours
[16:41:19] Cameron Nixon: We could
[16:41:37] Victor: /me would try to insert the datachip to the machine's slot.
[16:41:44] Victor: /it A red light triple-flashes.
[16:41:56] Victor: hm
[16:42:09] Victor: Maybe some dead sack has a card nearby.
[16:42:35] Victor: They probably abandoned this place for a reason, so, are you guys sure you want to continue?
[16:42:49] Victor: I'm going to, but I'm just letting you all know.
[16:42:59] John Smith: anthing?
[16:43:07] Victor: Fuck, I thought you heard me.
[16:43:12] John Smith: .// anything*
[16:43:18] Victor: No, a red light flashed at me.
[16:43:20] Victor: No alarm, just the light.
[16:43:40] Victor: chip didn't work.
[16:43:43] John Smith: alright, let's try that bug of yours.
[16:43:45] Cameron Nixon: Shock it, then.
[16:44:10] Cameron Nixon: /me *He'd focus "Tazer" on the Door, sending 7 Large Plasmatic Orbs at the Door.*
[16:44:47] Victor: /it The door doesn't quite seem to react, aside from the orbs making a little blue flash 
[16:45:07] Victor: damn
[16:45:09] Cameron Nixon: The door itself is electrically resistant it has a control.
[16:45:13] Victor: /toggleraise
[16:45:16] John Smith: in hindsight we probably should have backed up onto the concrete because of the metal.
[16:45:50] Victor: /toggleraise
[16:45:57] Victor: True.
[16:46:12] Victor: Maybe some dead sack has a card to work with the reader.
[16:46:16] Victor: But I'll let you guys know.
[16:46:20] Victor: This place seems weirdly abandoned.
[16:46:23] Victor: That might be for a good reason.
[16:46:28] Victor: Are you guys sure you want to continue?
[16:46:35] John Smith: yep
[16:46:35] Cameron Nixon: If we have a job to do.
[16:46:42] Victor: alright
[16:47:16] Victor: Maybe we can find a dead body with the card.
[16:47:20] John Smith: maybe
[16:47:25] Victor: let's try and see
[16:47:39] Cameron Nixon: Wait..
[16:47:42] Cameron Nixon: /y Wait
[16:47:52] John Smith: //wait
[16:47:54] Victor: sorry, what's up?
[16:48:06] Cameron Nixon: I have Cables, bundles of them, Wires too, and a Powercord.
[16:48:18] Cameron Nixon: Long enough that I could hook them up to this Remote Switch, and the door.
[16:48:56] John Smith: you're not really suggesting that we rig something up do you?
[16:49:05] Victor: Yeah, what are you expecting out of this?
[16:49:12] Cameron Nixon: That the door *opens*
[16:49:15] Cameron Nixon: It's, a door.
[16:49:31] John Smith: you really are suggesting that we rig something up
[16:49:40] Victor: He's saying it better than me.
[16:49:48] John Smith: bloody hell...
[16:50:08] Victor: It's a door, I'm holding a rifle, that's a road below me, what does it being a door have to do with anything?
[16:50:25] Cameron Nixon: Everything so far has been "rigged up" and you're about to go on a wild goose chase for another keycard when the first search almost got our head tken off. 
[16:50:31] Cameron Nixon: The fact that doors, open.
[16:50:42] Cameron Nixon: The fact that doors, have a way *to* open, and ways that can be overridden.
[16:50:49] Cameron Nixon: Doors can have a lock, that lock can be broken.
[16:50:57] Cameron Nixon: Doors can have a switch, switches can be changed.
[16:51:02] Cameron Nixon: Do you not understand basic engineering?
[16:51:12] John Smith: // brb gotta take a piss
[16:51:39] Victor: You want to... put wires in a card reader. And you just expect that to work?
[16:51:49] Cameron Nixon: That's, how wires. Work.
[16:52:03] Victor: Okay. So one end of the wire goes into a card reader with no ports for just random cables.
[16:52:08] Victor: The other end... goes where?
[16:52:15] Cameron Nixon: To this panel.
[16:52:28] Victor: The card reader is on this panel.
[16:52:41] Cameron Nixon: There was no card reader necessary to utilize this panel.
[16:52:45] Cameron Nixon: It's a literal button.
[16:53:09] Victor: There's a card reader on here as well as a button. I inserted the card into it. It didn't work.
[16:53:21] Victor: The datachip, that is.
[16:53:39] Victor: The button goes to the big gate.
[16:53:46] Victor: The card slot, I imagine, goes to the door.
[16:54:16] John Smith: know what fuck it, lets try and rig up the button to the door down there
[16:54:29] Cameron Nixon: The Button, that is Directed; to the Big Gate. Could be *Redirected*.. to the *Door*. Down there.
[16:54:36] John Smith: what could possibly go wrong
[16:54:40] Cameron Nixon: If it can open this massive gate, it can open that small ass door.
[16:54:52] Victor: Right. Do you have a screwdriver to open that panel?
[16:54:55] Cameron Nixon: If not than it physically breaks multiple laws and understands of Physics.
[16:54:57] Victor: Or a rivet remover?
[16:55:06] Victor: Or a wrench?
[16:55:06] Cameron Nixon: Does it have Screws, or Rivets.
[16:55:14] Cameron Nixon: Those are all completely different devices.
[16:55:19] Cameron Nixon: You really do not understand engineering.
[16:55:25] Victor: It sure as hell isn't just capable of being opened by joe blow.
[16:55:34] Cameron Nixon: Look for if it has Screws, Rivers, Bolts, whatever.
[16:55:41] Cameron Nixon: .// Rivets*
[16:56:08] John Smith: it doesn't have screws or rivets, it's just bolted on, can probably pry it off if we try hard enough
[16:56:38] Victor: /it It does in fact have rivets, the faceplate is sealed on.
[16:57:02] Cameron Nixon: Great, Rivets.
[16:57:05] Cameron Nixon: Simple as simple does.
[16:57:11] Cameron Nixon: Pliers will take them off.
[16:57:33] Cameron Nixon: /me *he'd move up to the Faceplate with an Industrial Pair of Pliers, removing the Popped Rivets from the Metal.*
[16:58:25] Victor: /it You would fail, because rivets aren't removed with pliers.
[16:58:33] Cameron Nixon: .// Yes, they are.
[16:58:43] Cameron Nixon: .// I'm sorry but do you genuinely know, anything. About engineering.
[16:59:06] Cameron Nixon: .// You could remove Rivets, with a burnt piece of plastic.
[16:59:24] Cameron Nixon: .// You could remove rivets by banging the side out with a hammer, or wrench, or a blunt-ended tool.
[16:59:25] Victor: .//rivet pliers aren't the same as regular pliers my guy
[16:59:54] Cameron Nixon: .// What type of pliers these are, aren't stated. 
[16:59:59] John Smith: // but did you see him say they could be banged out
[17:00:00] Victor: .//not rivet pliers
[17:00:06] Victor: .//based off of the model, they're flat pliers
[17:00:09] Cameron Nixon: .// You cant say that after I've already RP'd it lmao
[17:00:19] Victor: .//i'm not letting you RP it because they're not that type of pliers
[17:00:23] Victor: .//look at the model in your inv
[17:00:26] Victor: .//look up pictures of rivet pliers
[17:00:29] Victor: .//they're different
[17:00:46] Cameron Nixon: .// Are there any models of Rivet Pliers in your Server? :)
[17:00:56] John Smith: // they can still be banged out with a blunt instrument dumbass
[17:01:15] Cameron Nixon: // No one is calling any dumb also why are you using OOC lmao
[17:01:25] John Smith: // because everyone is here
[17:01:32] John Smith: // and im lazy
[17:01:36] Cameron Nixon: // I mean fair but use LOOC it looks cooler
[17:01:48] John Smith: // no
[17:01:54] Cameron Nixon: // Well I tried
[17:02:03] Victor: .//ther eare not, but  they're not stated to be rivet pliers guy
[17:02:14] Cameron Nixon: .// It's also not stated to be Flat Pliers.
[17:02:16] John Smith: // also sorry for calling you a dumbass q
[17:02:22] Cameron Nixon: .// Your point?
[17:02:55] Victor: .//on sec

[18:07:16] Skott Keil: // im aware
[18:07:25] Skott Keil: // is rping as my character not serious
[18:07:26] Cameron Nixon: I understand that much.
[18:07:27] Victor: It accepted the card.
[18:07:32] Victor: I'm trying to figure out what the hell the deal is here.
[18:07:43] Cameron Nixon: Okay so the correct answer was "I don't know"
[18:07:45] Victor: Why there are so many synths, how to open the factory door. This place is obviously combine. It's got terminals.
[18:07:46] Cameron Nixon: Got it.
[18:07:48] Skott Keil: cool
[18:07:50] Victor: Holy hell.
[18:07:58] Victor: Let's see...
[18:08:04] Victor: It's telling me my location is the factory.
[18:08:08] Victor: So.. this is the factory?
[18:08:18] Victor: This little place?
[18:08:23] Skott Keil: maybe that was a citadel?
[18:08:37] Victor: Citadels don't tend to look like that. I don't know what that thing was.
[18:08:41] Victor: I'll see what it says.
[18:08:45] Skott Keil: sub-citadel?
[18:08:56] Victor: /me scrolls progressively as he reads what's on the screen.
[18:08:59] John Smith: uh...
[18:09:10] Victor: According to the terminal, it's some kind of... commanding body?
[18:09:19] Skott Keil: /me stretches against the wall and sighs in relief.
[18:09:19] Victor: What, so there's a high ranking scientist in there? Or was in there?
[18:09:22] Skott Keil: nice..
[18:09:31] Victor: It says there are three remaining specimens, all unnamed.
[18:09:42] Victor: Let me see how to get in...
[18:09:46] Victor: Yep. Needs a card.
[18:09:57] Victor: Whatever this commanding body is, I want to get a look at it. Maybe it's the key to getting rid of this place.
[18:10:02] Victor: Let me just download all this...
[18:10:04] Dropped "Skott Keil" from server<STEAM_0:1:172190965>
[18:10:13] Victor: /me downloads whatever relevant information is on the terminal to the datachip.
[18:10:25] Victor: Well, might as well check out those other two specimens.
[18:10:29] Victor: /toggleraise
[18:10:34] John Smith: what the fuck?
[18:10:37] Victor: Is that..
[18:10:42] Victor: holy shit.
[18:10:42] Cameron Nixon: Hey
[18:10:45] Cameron Nixon: More important thing.
[18:10:47] Victor: Tell me these things aren't in production yet.
[18:10:49] Victor: /toggleraise
[18:10:54] Cameron Nixon: Online Terminal.
[18:10:54] John Smith: it's a Vort...
[18:10:56] Victor: Yeah, another terminal, I was just at one.
[18:10:58] Victor: The other one was online.
[18:11:05] Cameron Nixon: Bit more important then that
[18:11:06] Victor: I'm just gonna...
[18:11:09] Cameron Nixon: We're trying to get into the Factory.
[18:11:12] Victor: It is literally just another terminal.
[18:11:29] Victor: /me raises his AR1 to the synth's head.
[18:11:32] Victor: Sorry about this...
[18:11:43] Victor: /me pulls the trigger, shooting a round directly into the synth's head.
[18:11:51] Victor: If it wasn't dead before, it is now.
[18:11:54] Victor: /toggleraise
[18:11:57] Victor: /toggleraise
[18:11:59] Victor: /toggleraise
[18:12:03] Victor: Fine, let's see.
[18:12:05] John Smith: nothin over here
[18:12:33] Victor: /me inserts his card into the terminal.
[18:12:36] Victor: Seems like the same stuff...
[18:12:39] Victor: Here we go.
[18:12:46] Victor: Something about a weakness in the design.
[18:12:57] Victor: Hey, bug guy.
[18:12:59] Cameron Nixon: Oh, joy.
[18:13:06] Victor: Don't forget, the terminal literally said this is the factory.
[18:13:12] Victor: I'm not sure if you've been listening, but that's what it said.
[18:13:22] Victor: Something blew a hole in that building, and they didn't patch it up in time.
[18:13:29] Cameron Nixon: Which is, important.
[18:13:32] Victor: It says it should be vulnerable to exploses.
[18:13:36] Victor: .//explosives.*
[18:13:41] Cameron Nixon: Do you have, Explosives.
[18:13:42] Victor: Well, we just need to find an explosive.
[18:13:48] Victor: No, but maybe there's an explosive nearby.
[18:13:53] Cameron Nixon: Alright
[18:13:59] John Smith: that Synth is creeping me out...
[18:14:00] Victor: We never checked out that other specimen. That weird soccer ball looking one.
[18:14:07] Victor: It's dead. I hope.
[18:14:22] Victor: huh./
[18:14:39] Victor: /it A button is over the top of the shelf, next to the bed.
[18:14:42] John Smith: // thank you consul
[18:14:48] Victor: /it It reads "Test fire."
[18:14:50] Victor: Hm.
[18:14:59] Cameron Nixon: Uh.
[18:15:05] Cameron Nixon: Probably shouldn't press that.
[18:15:07] Victor: Well, I'm a little nervous about triggering this thing in here.
[18:15:08] Victor: Yeah, no.
[18:15:21] Victor: /me takes out his combat knife and cuts the cord running from the button to the scanner.
[18:15:28] Victor: There, now nobody will accidentally press it.
[18:15:42] Victor: I do see some kind of hole here, near the weird part here.
[18:15:57] Victor: Probably where the test fire launchers from.
[18:16:42] Victor: We could try to take it outside and launch it into the distance. We've got terminals with power somewhere, we should be able to just give this thing a jolt and see what it does.
[18:17:00] Victor: Given that it's got a hole on it, I imagine it's a projectile.
[18:17:03] Victor: Maybe a bullet?
[18:17:10] Victor: I'm not gonna try it in here.
[18:17:13] Victor: Who wants to see what it does?
[18:17:15] John Smith: or a small explosive?
[18:17:18] Cameron Nixon: Sure.
[18:17:29] Victor: maybe
[18:17:37] Cameron Nixon: Idea.
[18:17:41] Victor: yeah?
[18:17:49] Cameron Nixon: We could aim it at the Weakspot and shock it with Tazer.
[18:18:01] Victor: That's a great idea.
[18:18:16] Victor: Also, how are you carrying this thing with two hands when you've got the bug on your other hand?
[18:18:22] Victor: Is that a superpower, or...
[18:18:27] Cameron Nixon: Just holding it in one hand
[18:18:30] Cameron Nixon: It's rather.. Heavy.
[18:18:36] John Smith: i can carry it
[18:18:36] Victor: Yeah, I'm surprised you can hold it.
[18:18:39] Victor: alright.
[18:18:40] Cameron Nixon: I am too. This hurts.
[18:18:43] Victor: Let's just drive over in the car.
[18:18:48] Cameron Nixon: Uh, sure.
[18:18:55] Cameron Nixon: To... The.. Car.
[18:18:57] Victor: We're near it anyways.
[18:19:16] Victor: Fuck, I'm an idiot.
[18:19:26] Victor: Don't let it hit the vvater.
[18:19:28] Victor: Just in case.
[18:19:30] Cameron Nixon: Yup.
[18:19:56] Victor: /toggleraise
[18:19:58] John Smith: i'm half expecting to see a gunship fly over
[18:20:11] Cameron Nixon: Surprised one hasn't already..

[18:22:14] Victor: /it The button was in the other location, so don't worry, you're fine.
[18:22:22] Cameron Nixon: We're good. *He'd shut the doors*

[18:22:26] Victor: .//oh my bad
[18:22:31] Cameron Nixon: .// Oh I interpreted it as it being on the creature lmao
[18:22:39] Victor: Might wanna put that thing in a seatbelt and hold it down.
[18:22:41] Cameron Nixon: We're fine keep er' going
[18:22:49] Cameron Nixon: /me *he'd grab the Synth, rolling it into the Pit of his arm.*
[18:23:12] John Smith: may want to park the car here
[18:23:12] Victor: Alright.

[18:31:55] Victor: Reading what I can find..
[18:31:55] Cameron Nixon: Yup..
[18:32:05] Victor: This thing is a big living... computer?
[18:32:08] Victor: Or strange synth.
[18:32:12] Victor: It's not too specific.
[18:32:19] Victor: Either way, it's alive, and it controls the factory.
[18:32:28] Cameron Nixon: So... We kill it?
[18:32:32] Victor: Hold on now.
[18:32:36] Victor: An incident report.
[18:32:39] Cameron Nixon: Hm?
[18:33:01] Victor: It seems like they closed the factory in a hurry, because of...
[18:33:05] Victor: ...The incident in City 8.
[18:33:10] Victor: Do either of you know what this is?
[18:33:13] Victor: Precinct 33?
[18:33:25] John Smith: no...
[18:33:33] Victor: What about you, bug guy?
[18:33:34] Victor: No idea?
[18:34:18] Victor: Alright.
[18:34:32] Victor: Well, it says that a train crashed in the outlands near precinct 33.
[18:34:37] Cameron Nixon: Woah..
[18:34:38] Victor: Three specimens were lost.
[18:34:43] Cameron Nixon: So its.. Updating.. *Recently*
[18:34:46] Victor: And then reclaimed by protection teams.
[18:34:52] Cameron Nixon: Might even be posting something about the incident.. *Right now*
[18:35:01] Victor: It says this happened a few weeks ago.
[18:35:10] Cameron Nixon: What? That can't be right.
[18:35:22] Victor: This thing must be linked to their network, then.
[18:35:55] Victor: This place has been abandoned for three months.
[18:36:23] Cameron Nixon: Yikes..
[18:36:28] Victor: So, let's see.
[18:36:30] Cameron Nixon: So, what now? Why are we here?
[18:36:36] Victor: They were reclaimed and brought back to precinct 33's nexus.
[18:37:05] Victor: Then reportedly a vortigaunt that units claimed was following them opened the crates the synths were stored in?
[18:37:15] Victor: Not sure how a vortigaunt got that far.
[18:37:23] John Smith: wait...
[18:37:23] Victor: Maybe this is some vortigaunt magic I'm not familiar with.
[18:37:38] Victor: Can they go invisible?
[18:37:42] Victor: I didn't think that was a thing.
[18:37:43] John Smith: could that Vort we saw be the same one that opened the Synth crates?
[18:38:00] Victor: Maybe. It says that the vort got away unexplainably.
[18:38:04] Victor: Maybe they caught it.
[18:38:08] Victor: Doesn't specify.
[18:38:22] Victor: But apparently this place was already not producing too many resultws.
[18:38:25] Victor: Even, before this.
[18:38:55] Victor: They were wasteland oriented, which explains the color.
[18:39:32] Victor: And they just weren't doing so well, so they cancelled it, but were delaying removing everything because there were other complications with the logistics of it all.
[18:40:02] Victor: Then that incident happened and they just got as many people as they could to clear it out in a rush.
[18:40:11] Victor: Explains why the job was bad.
[18:41:00] Victor: This thing was their biggest project, though. A new way of doing management.
[18:41:17] Victor: Records say they locked this place down until they could properly the remove it.
[18:41:52] Victor: So, seems like we got here before they could remove it.
[18:41:59] Victor: Seems like it's still active, and it controls more than just this factory.
[18:42:37] Victor: It helps out with City 42, a relatively close city in pre-war in, I think pre-war Hong Kong.
[18:43:03] Victor: Or Seoul? Doesn't matter.
[18:43:08] Victor: So apparently this thing matters.
[18:43:12] Victor: So that raises the question.
[18:43:25] John Smith: //q read the sentence that you typed about city 42 and tell me you don't see something wrong
[18:43:33] Victor: //i have brain rot oaky
[18:43:38] Victor: Do we kill it, and then make the Combine flip out, or leave it, and risk them getting help out of it?
[18:43:51] Victor: Keep in mind, they may be able to track us all down.
[18:44:02] Victor: Well, I'm already off the grid.
[18:44:07] Victor: But you two aren't.
[18:44:21] Victor: So do we make the Combine furious at us, or do we risk helping thme?
[18:44:41] Victor: No, I'm asking.
[18:45:00] John Smith: I'd say make em pissed at us
[18:45:26] John Smith: im fine with saying "Fuck you!" and going off the grid
[18:45:36] Victor: Cameron?
[18:45:49] Cameron Nixon: Keeping this Synth Factory up, risks it continuing to produce Synths, they'll perfect it eventually just like with anything else.
[18:45:57] Cameron Nixon: I'd say Sabo' the Factory but..
[18:45:59] Cameron Nixon: The Pods.
[18:46:03] Cameron Nixon: We need to check the Pods.
[18:46:11] Cameron Nixon: Before we do any kind of destroying.
[18:46:13] Victor: Let me see, it might say something about that.
[18:46:33] John Smith: Does anyone else here feel like their being watched?
[18:46:59] Victor: It says the pods contain vortigaunts, who are used as backup power in case the normal power fails.
[18:47:07] John Smith: well
[18:47:08] Cameron Nixon: Christ, open the Pods!
[18:47:12] John Smith: let's get them out then
[18:47:43] Victor: Let me open them..
[18:47:47] Victor: /me presses a button.
[18:47:52] Victor: /it One at a time, the pods open.

[18:50:06] Vortigaunt: We thank you greatly.
[18:50:22] Vortigaunt: We have been in these pods for a great many months.
[18:50:29] Cameron Nixon: So we've seen. Tell us.
[18:50:34] Cameron Nixon: What is that thing.
[18:50:37] Cameron Nixon: Do you know.
[18:50:50] Vortigaunt: These shackles, much to the Combine's chagrin, only allow us to be restricted to the pods, much unlike our unslaved kin in the cities.
[18:50:56] Vortigaunt: Ah'glaa.
[18:51:08] Vortigaunt: This.
[18:51:09] Cameron Nixon: We will get those Shackles and Cuffs off of you at the moment we can..
[18:51:22] Vortigaunt: They do not restrict our power.
[18:51:32] Vortigaunt: Unlike those of my kind who are enslaved within a city.
[18:51:42] Cameron Nixon: But this one.
[18:51:43] Vortigaunt: This, this is a tortured being.
[18:51:50] Cameron Nixon: Tortured? It?
[18:52:01] Cameron Nixon: It is said this Controls the Factory.
[18:52:16] Vortigaunt: Indeed. Its natural form has been perverted by the Combine to suit their needs for this factory.
[18:52:24] Vortigaunt blinded Cameron Nixon,John Smith by amount 255
[18:52:27] Cameron Nixon: Can we free it, will it hurt us.

[18:53:36] Vortigaunt: It, unfortunately, as with the Parthican and the Victrix, are beyond saving.
[18:53:53] Vortigaunt: .//is beyond saving*
[18:54:00] Cameron Nixon: You, and your Brothers.
[18:54:04] Cameron Nixon: If taken out of your Shackles.
[18:54:13] Cameron Nixon: Can you free it from its Torture? From its Existence?
[18:55:15] Vortigaunt: As for the third time, these shackles do not restrict our power.
[18:55:51] Vortigaunt: A hearing exam would be best for you to seek when you return from this awful place.
[18:56:03] Vortigaunt: We can, in fact, destroy this.
[18:56:11] John Smith: .//r/rareinsults
[18:56:41] Vortigaunt: It may be fairly unpleasant with its sanitation.
[18:56:46] Cameron Nixon: Alright, others I've encountered can and are restricted; be wise with your words and pray you do not encounter such restriction.
[18:57:01] Cameron Nixon: Do what you must.
[18:57:06] Vortigaunt: As I have said for the fourth time now.
[18:57:11] Cameron Nixon: Our singular vehicle surely cannot take all then of you.
[18:57:18] Vortigaunt: These pods only ensure we are stuck in the pods, unable to move.
[18:57:29] Vortigaunt: Unlike my kin in the city, whose shackles do in fact restrict their power.
[18:57:30] Vortigaunt: Do you understand?
[18:57:37] Cameron Nixon: For the second time, I do.
[18:58:23] Vortigaunt: You seemed to misunderstand the first three times, as you again said that the shackles would  be an obstacle.
[18:58:40] Vortigaunt: The sanitation is particularly messy, you two would likely be more comfortable elsewhere.
[18:58:53] Vortigaunt: .//the Removal is*
[18:59:15] Cameron Nixon: I'd advise that as soon as it's done you leave as well. I cannot garuntee your safety, or our own. This will surely alert the combine.
[18:59:44] Vortigaunt: Indeed. My kin and I must leave with you, for it is safer in numbers.
[18:59:56] Vortigaunt: We will not last as much time on foot as it will take them to arrive here in such great numbers.
[19:00:21] Vortigaunt: We shall make seating arrangements, worry not.
[19:00:26] Vortigaunt: Wait for us outside, we shall follow.
[19:00:28] Cameron Nixon: We only have one Vehicle... However, with a few *Trips*.. it will be able.
[19:00:32] Cameron Nixon: We will be outside.
[19:00:34] Cameron Nixon: Come on.
[19:00:39] Vortigaunt: Within the time of one trip will be enough time for them.
[19:00:44] Vortigaunt: We will make arrangements.
[19:00:47] Cameron Nixon: Good.

[19:04:55] Cameron Nixon: /y Drive it back around, just down the Road.
[19:05:04] Cameron Nixon: /me *he'd carry the Orb Synth with him into the front seat.*
[19:05:12] Cameron Nixon: lets go
[19:05:17] Cameron Nixon: yeah
[19:05:25] Vortigaunt: /event Like a clown car, all ten vorts come inside and shut the door. They're crammed in, but it works.
[19:05:38] Vortigaunt: /y Onwards!
[19:05:43] Vortigaunt: /event A helicopter passes overhead.
[19:05:47] Vortigaunt: /y QUICKLY, WE MUST DRIVE.
[19:05:47] Cameron Nixon: /me *he'd laugh at the almost comical arrangement, but glad that he could assist in saving the ten Vorts.*
