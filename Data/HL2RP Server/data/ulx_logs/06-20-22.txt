[20:55:54] CCA.C17-HELIX.DvL.33698: Righty oh.
[20:55:56] John Smith: /me would then get the *overwhelming* sensation that he was being watched from afar...
[20:55:59] Peter VonSchnitzel: Lets go then
[20:55:59] Isaac Stoner: So I figured.
[20:56:12] CCA.C17-HELIX.DvL.33698: So, you can't remember what happened? Can you name any details?
[20:56:14] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: /me would remove a ziptie from a satchel on his utility belt. He reaches for the man's wrists. Would he resist to his wrists being grabbed?

[20:59:39] Carson Copper: I would think that's uhh- common sense.
[20:59:47] Isaac Stoner: I ain't mentally ill, so not keen on wrecking public property.
[20:59:51] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: Face the wall again.
[21:00:00] Robbert Garth: I mean, I felt urges... but the pain was more of an issue
[21:00:01] Carson Copper: Yikes.... who's gonna clean up all.
[21:00:01] John Smith: /me would laugh harder from the realization that that's what Joseph did.
[21:00:02] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: /me would clip open a satchel and pull a blindfold from it.

[21:50:04] CCA.C17-HELIX.DvL.33698: /me saws into the neck, as blood splatters nearby, some of it landing on the DvL's uniform. Within moments, this man was reduced to nothing but a living head.

[21:50:42] Paul-Henri Cartier to admins: suitcases dont work
[21:50:58] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: If you want furniture, it's not a crime to take stuff of the street, or you can try to get some through a CWU friend.
[21:51:01] CCA.C17-HELIX.DvL.33698: /me soon grabs a scalpel. Now for the hard part. He'd begin to make incisions around the head, being carefull to only cut through the skin layer.
[21:51:08] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: Look at me.
[21:51:10] Matthew Miller: Alright
[21:51:13] Derek Williams: Alright.

[21:51:52] Derek Williams: /chardesc 5'7 | Brown Eyes | Slim build | Flat brown hair with some stubble | Derek is an avid supporter of the Combine occupation. He believes in their goals and thinks that they are maintaining the Earth well and keeping order in the streets.
[21:51:56] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313 to admins: hmm
[21:51:57] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313 to admins: uhhh
[21:51:57] CCA.C17-HELIX.DvL.33698: /me after a few minutes, the DvL slowly, but surely began to remove  the skin off the head. Like a orange if you will. Albeit in neat strips. Eventually the man was left with nothing but muscle.
[21:52:01] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313 to admins: i fix tomorrow
[21:52:18] Paul-Henri Cartier: I gotta say
[21:52:27] Paul-Henri Cartier: the one thing the combine have right is graphic design
[21:52:31] Ethan King: True 
[21:52:34] Ethan King: And uniforms honestly 
[21:52:36] Paul-Henri Cartier: uniforms are cool too, I guess
[21:52:40] Paul-Henri Cartier: like Nazi Germany
[21:52:49] Paul-Henri Cartier: If they were a little less...
[21:52:49] Ethan King: Right, morally fucked....
[21:52:55] Paul-Henri Cartier: /me gestures vaguely around him
[21:53:18] Ethan King: /me tilted his head, before simply nodding, "If they were a little less fucked we're probably like them..."
[21:53:25] CCA.C17-HELIX.DvL.33698: /me soon starts making the same cuts, and much like strips of skin, the muscle would be peeled off into strips.
[21:53:29] Ethan King: /looc we'd*
[21:53:39] Paul-Henri Cartier: Yeah
[21:53:54] Ethan King: Also god damn, the fucking broadcast gets on your nerves.
[21:53:59] CCA.C17-HELIX.DvL.33698: /it The man was now simply a skull. A living one, at that. Blood was still being filtered to the brain afterall.
[21:53:59] Paul-Henri Cartier: Tell me being an OTA wouldn't be badass, without the brainwashing. The augments alone
[21:54:12] Ethan King: We used to have just fucking dispatch talking, now we have that fuckin' Consul or whatever speaking.
[21:54:17] Ethan King: Back in our....
[21:54:31] Ethan King: World I guess, the Combine were slightly more likable.
[21:54:42] Paul-Henri Cartier: That uh.. Cave Johnson guy, I liked him
[21:54:43] Client "Rust" connected.
[21:54:56] Ethan King: /me chuckled, "Yes...Cave."
[21:55:07] Ethan King: It was an honor fighting for him....though I'm surprised I ever did.
[21:55:11] CCA.C17-HELIX.DvL.33698: /me grabs a new set of tools. A chisel and a small hammer. He'd align the chisel, soon giving the skull small taps, starting at the temples as the skull began to crack ever so slightly.
[21:55:20] Matthew Miller: // do items despawn
[21:55:23] CCA.C17-HELIX.DvL.33698 to admins: Might need you soon. Starting brain extraction.
[21:55:23] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: //nosir
[21:55:26] Ethan King: I haven't told you about my old days in city 08, have I?
[21:55:26] Derek Williams: /ooc nice
[21:55:29] Paul-Henri Cartier: If it wasn't for him, I'd probably still you know..
[21:55:32] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313<STEAM_0:1:53097688> changed their name to The Consul
[21:55:37] Paul-Henri Cartier: Be working in the CCA, or worse
[21:55:47] Derek Williams: /ooc uh is it planned for fridges to have like actual item storage and stuff similar to suitcases and inventories
[21:55:48] Paul-Henri Cartier: /yes
[21:55:50] Paul-Henri Cartier: // yes
[21:55:58] Ethan King: /me nodded, "Yes...you probably would be."
[21:55:59] The Consul: //yeah storage items rae borken for some reason
[21:56:04] Derek Williams: /ooc Ah
[21:56:07] Ethan King: Your...situation is quite unique.
[21:56:10] Paul-Henri Cartier: mhm
[21:56:13] CCA.C17-HELIX.DvL.33698: /me after a few times going around the man's skull, eventually the top became seperate. He'd set aside the hammer and chisel as he moves the top, revealing the brain. Still hooked up and vitals stable.
[21:56:24] Paul-Henri Cartier: I've even underwent that unionwashing shit, it.. was a weird sensation
[21:56:37] CCA.C17-HELIX.DvL.33698: Okay. Everything seems stable still.
[21:56:47] Ethan King: Yes...you are unionwashed...but a rebel.
[21:56:49] The Consul: Wonderful.
[21:56:50] CCA.C17-HELIX.DvL.33698: He's- It's living.
[21:56:58] The Consul: You are receiving brain activity?
[21:57:00] Ethan King: /me chuckled, "1 in a million thing, aren't you?"
[21:57:02] Paul-Henri Cartier: not a rebel, resistance. There's a difference
[21:57:16] Paul-Henri Cartier: A rebel is fighting against a legally imposed government, but resistance?
[21:57:21] CCA.C17-HELIX.DvL.33698: Yup. At least according to the nearby terminal.
[21:57:22] Paul-Henri Cartier: That's fighting against an illegal regime
[21:57:25] The Consul: Wonderful.
[21:57:27] CCA.C17-HELIX.DvL.33698: It's conscious.
[21:57:28] The Consul: It is..
[21:57:29] Ethan King: Fair, fair.
[21:57:31] The Consul: It's a success.
[21:57:32] Ethan King: But....
[21:57:33] The Consul: It's conscious.
[21:57:39] The Consul: /it The realization would finally be sinking in.
[21:57:42] The Consul: We have hope!
[21:57:50] Ethan King: Someday...remind me to talk to you about City 08, maybe I'll....well maybe I'll tell you.
[21:57:52] The Consul: wonderful, now for the next phase of experimentation.
[21:58:05] The Consul: /it With a single swift movement, The consul unholsters his .357 and shoots the brain twice.
[21:58:06] Paul-Henri Cartier: We can talk right now, it seems safe out here
[21:58:06] The Consul<STEAM_0:1:53097688> spawned/gave himself swep weapon_357

[21:58:27] The Consul cloaked Hunter Morrison by amount 0
[21:58:29] Ethan King: /me placed a hand onto his chest, "Sorry, it's a long story...."
[21:58:33] The Consul to admins: almost, i want ot describe the next phase

[21:59:17] Paul-Henri Cartier: /me would reach into his satchel and pull out some corn, handing it to Ethan
[21:59:24] The Consul: The next step is to connect the nervous system of a trusted ministry official to the advisor's body.
[21:59:27] The Consul: A full mental link.
[21:59:39] Ethan King: /me takes the Corn...looking it over with an obvious, "What the fuck" face under his mask.
[21:59:48] The Consul: Let us pick out our next ministry official.
[21:59:52] CCA.C17-HELIX.DvL.33698: Copy
[21:59:54] Paul-Henri Cartier suicided!
[21:59:54] Paul-Henri Cartier slayed Themself
[22:00:00] The Consul: /me would proceed to tie the individual. Would they resist?
[22:00:03] The Consul returned Hunter Morrison to their original position
