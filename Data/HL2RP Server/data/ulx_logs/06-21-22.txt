[12:42:16] Vala Mal Doran: /broadcast Well, as you may know, this sector is an industrial sector. Obviously, an unfortunate side effect of some needed industrial processes makes the air difficult to breath. This is why you are supplied a respirator or suit when you depart the train.

[12:43:15] Vala Mal Doran: /broadcast Please wear it. Our second question is quite long, but basically boils down to "How do I join the CCA?". That is a good question, as you go about your life, you may find work opportunities, either by asking a local CCA unit, or by being assigned

[15:40:07] Jared Marshall: Yeah. I wrote that down.
[15:40:27] Jared Marshall: Well then. Guess we'll be waiting for a while
[15:40:36] Aurelio Grau: That was creepy.
[15:40:44] Jared Marshall: What was
[15:40:45] Aurelio Grau: Thought I heard footsteps from the drums.
[15:40:50] Jared Marshall: Oh. Heh.
[15:41:03] Jared Marshall: Yeah. I hear it too.
[15:41:19] Aurelio Grau: Man this shit's really kickin'
[15:42:01] Jared Marshall: Man. Post-war music's pretty sick.
[15:42:16] Aurelio Grau: Or maybe we just miss music.
[15:42:18] Jared Marshall: Well, it's obviously pre-war but still.
[15:42:21] Jared Marshall: Yeah.
[15:42:21] Carson Copper killed Carson Copper
[15:42:26] Ethan King: /chardesc
[15:42:39] Jared Marshall: Crazy to think that people heard it all the time before the war.
[15:42:53] Aurelio Grau: Yeah. Was able to listen to it any time we wanted.
[15:43:08] Jared Marshall: I'm wondering how these are still broadcasting...
[15:43:13] Jared Marshall: Very odd.
[15:43:29] Aurelio Grau: Couldn't tell ya'
[15:43:58] Jared Marshall: If there's some radio station out there with people that are alive still working in them then they must be crazy as hell
[15:44:25] Jared Marshall: You'd think the Combine or some aliens would find them
[15:44:38] Aurelio Grau: I wonder about the people that live in the wilderness by themselves who never even knew about this shit.
[15:44:53] Jared Marshall: Oh, man. That wouldn't be fun.
[15:45:09] Jared Marshall: Like you get back from a fishing trip and then seconds later the world's already ended.
[15:45:17] Aurelio Grau: Yup.
[15:45:31] Client "twitch_subbot" connected.
[15:45:34] Jared Marshall: Very sad to think about.
[15:45:54] Aurelio Grau: Could also think about the isolated tribes and shit, too.
[15:46:01] Jared Marshall: Hmm...
[15:46:02] Aurelio Grau: Not a care in the world.
[15:46:11] Jared Marshall: Looks like someone's here.
[15:46:33] Jared Marshall: /y King?
[15:46:35] Jared Marshall: /y Paul?
[15:47:01] Jared Marshall: Oh, there you are.
[15:47:12] Ethan King: /me would look at the two of them, sighing, "Yes....hello."
[15:47:27] Ethan King: We have located the outlands...though it's filled with Antlions.
[15:47:42] Client "twitch_subbot" spawned in server <STEAM_0:0:585787645> (took 131 seconds).
[15:47:42] Carson Copper suicided!
[15:47:45] Jared Marshall: Where's Paul?
[15:47:52] Ethan King: Me and Paul have decided it be best to...hide in plain sight....so to speak.
[15:47:58] Ethan King: Scouting, he'll be a minute.
[15:48:06] Aurelio Grau: You find the beach?
[15:48:21] Ethan King: /me nodded, "Affirmative, me and Paul have located the beach."
[15:48:33] Ethan King: However, at the moment...we have deamed it too risky to live in.
[15:48:43] Aurelio Grau: Yeah, those massive flying shits?
[15:48:49] Ethan King: Antlions, affirmative.
[15:48:51] Jared Marshall: Wait, you were talking about the antlions?
[15:48:55] Aurelio Grau: Yup.
[15:49:01] Jared Marshall: Damn. That was a terrible description.
[15:49:04] Jared Marshall: No offense.
[15:49:05] Ethan King: We have neither the ammo nor the resources to fight them.
[15:49:06] Aurelio Grau: Massive insects?
[15:49:13] Aurelio Grau: That's what they look like.
[15:49:19] Jared Marshall: Massive insects with wings... ah, well I guess they are sorta like that.
[15:49:20] Ethan King: /atc This is ATC, your request has been <c=255,0,0>DENIED</c>
[15:49:27] Aurelio Grau: They totally do.
[15:49:35] Ethan King: /me huffed, "What he meant was noticed, it's fine."
[15:49:39] Jared Marshall: Yeah.
[15:49:43] Ethan King: Regardless, the question we have....
[15:49:48] Ethan King: Is what will you two be doing?
[15:49:59] Jared Marshall: It really depends on what the group decides on doing.
[15:50:07] Jared Marshall: We can't go to the Coast.
[15:50:13] Dropped "twitch_subbot" from server<STEAM_0:0:585787645>
[15:50:30] Jared Marshall: But then again, there's apparently a combine outpost over there that might have some supplies or information.
[15:50:34] Ethan King: If you are to join us fully, know that you will likely experience horrible things.
[15:50:44] Jared Marshall: Woah woah woah, I thought we already were a team?
[15:50:57] Dropped "Somatical" from server<STEAM_0:1:184534336>
[15:51:02] Ethan King: It seems you've got it wrong, you are some refugees I've come into contact with.
[15:51:07] Aurelio Grau: Eh, we didn't contribute much to the 'team' besides a little bit of food and clothes.
[15:51:13] Jared Marshall: That is true.
[15:51:13] Aurelio Grau: .// food not clothes lol
[15:51:19] Aurelio Grau: .// fuck
[15:51:22] Aurelio Grau: .// water not clothes
[15:51:24] Jared Marshall: Though we did set up at this camp first.
[15:51:29] Jared Marshall: /looc You still found clothes lol
[15:51:30] Ethan King: /me shook his head, "You contributed enough, but we've no reason to bring some unarmed refugees into are group."
[15:51:46] Ethan King: The city 08 revelutionary act....or whatever it was calle ..
[15:51:48] Jared Marshall: Understandable. We're not exactly the most combat ready.
[15:51:49] Ethan King: /looc called*
[15:52:09] Ethan King: Been a while...but we're still atleast trying to stay on our feet.
[15:52:21] Aurelio Grau: I think grouping up would be the safest. I got surface access so food isn't a problem and it'd be nice to escape from the shit upstairs.
[15:52:39] Ethan King: Affirmative, but, we will not be entering the outlands immediately.
[15:52:45] Ethan King: And I am strict on that.
[15:52:56] Ethan King: If you are found going to the outlands right now, we will not save you.
[15:53:00] Jared Marshall: I think being in these sewers, though primitive, might just be our best choice anyway. I've been in this camp for a while.
[15:53:14] Aurelio Grau: In here's fine for a bit. Just need to 'clean' it up a little.
[15:53:20] Jared Marshall: Yeah.
[15:53:28] Ethan King: I have too much experience in sewer sweeps to trust this place.
[15:53:35] Ethan King: Hiding in plain sight is the best option.
[15:53:46] Ethan King: /me points upwards, "Somewhere in the rooftops."
[15:53:49] Jared Marshall: Well, from what I've seen, they don't sweep these sewers.
[15:53:50] Aurelio Grau: Ah, wow.
[15:53:59] Aurelio Grau: Atop the Diordna?
[15:54:00] Ethan King: Used to think the same Jared...
[15:54:03] Ethan King: I used to....
[15:54:10] Jared Marshall: Well... I also did as well. You're right.
[15:54:24] Jared Marshall: I guess City 14 should've taught me more things.
[15:54:25] Ethan King: But after a few bad encounters and some friends killed, you learn to be creative.
[15:54:31] Ethan King: And onto your question, we'll have to see.
[15:54:46] Ethan King: Diordna might just be a little...too in plain sight.
[15:54:57] Carson Copper: // oh fuck
[15:54:57] Aurelio Grau: Yeah, but it's an access point to other places up top.
[15:55:01] Ethan King: Near the rooftops at the construction sight would be best I believe.
[15:55:07] Ethan King: // wha 
[15:55:07] Aurelio Grau: Yeah, sure.
[15:55:10] Jared Marshall: Well, Aurelio and I can make up for our lack of armament with supply gathering and maybe rounding up more people.
[15:55:15] Jared Marshall: But then again...
[15:55:21] Aurelio Grau: More people could be a problem.
[15:55:23] Jared Marshall: If we get more numbers, we'll be more easy to find.
[15:55:24] Jared Marshall: Yeah.
[15:55:34] Ethan King: And numbers adds a whole lot of newer problems 
[15:55:38] Ethan King: However, having some....
[15:55:39] Ethan King: Well
[15:55:41] Aurelio Grau: Hey, maybe we could just not let them in 'the circle'?
[15:55:51] Carson Copper: // *nothing....*
[15:55:53] Ethan King: To put it simply, throwaway members might be in orders.
[15:55:58] Carson Copper: // *not stuck above the world*
[15:56:01] Aurelio Grau: Use 'em for other things that we don't need to do.
[15:56:02] Ethan King: // WHA 
[15:56:05] Carson Copper: // *totally...*
[15:56:08] Aurelio Grau: Or something like that.
[15:56:20] Jared Marshall: Or maybe we could just get sources from up top that provide us with information.
[15:56:21] Ethan King: Affirmative, rebellions are built off of such things.
[15:56:25] Jared Marshall: Information is something we lack.
[15:56:34] Aurelio Grau: No need for them to know about the inner workings.
[15:56:48] Ethan King: Jared, I am not here to fight the Combine, I have my mind focussed on more important things.
[15:57:01] Aurelio Grau: Survival? Freedom, maybe?
[15:57:13] Ethan King: /me huffed, "Far more important, but that is for another day."
[15:57:20] Ethan King: However...if you'll excuse me.
[15:57:24] Paul-Henri Cartier: Boo

[15:59:30] Jared Marshall: He thinks it best to hide in plain sight. I assume you do as well.
[15:59:43] Paul-Henri Cartier: I was the one who fucking gave him that idea
[15:59:50] Dilly_<STEAM_0:0:52468151> changed their name to Carson Copper
[15:59:51] Paul-Henri Cartier: what is this plagarism

[16:00:02] Jared Marshall: I'm... indifferent.
[16:00:04] Carson Copper: // yup... just vibin up here
[16:00:06] Jared Marshall: If it works, it works.

[16:01:17] Aurelio Grau: Gotcha'

[16:08:53] Ethan King: You had a fucking spare?
[16:08:57] Paul-Henri Cartier: Yeah
[16:09:04] Ethan King: It was probably mine, but whatever.
[16:09:12] Jared Marshall: If anything Aurelio deserves this more. He'd probably get more use out of it.
[16:09:14] Jared Marshall: Take it back.
[16:09:17] Jared Marshall: /me hands it to you
[16:09:21] Ethan King: Aurelio is are  inside man
[16:09:37] Paul-Henri Cartier: /me would hand the pistol to Mr. King
[16:09:38] Jared Marshall: He's the one always going out there for supplies. He also had trouble with the antlions.
[16:09:51] Paul-Henri Cartier: speaking of supplies!
[16:09:53] Ethan King: He shouldn't be in the outlands either way.
[16:09:57] Paul-Henri Cartier: /me points to the air vent

[16:25:27] Ethan King: /me would sling over his MP7, sighing.
[16:26:00] Ethan King: Right, I will make it clear for right now, we are to not engage or attempt to engage Combine units unless either given the order to by me...or if absolutely needed.
[16:26:26] Ethan King: If we are attacked, we run, if we are found, we hide, if these sewers are swept...we hide once more.
[16:26:49] Ethan King: We are here to live, not fight, none of us are true soldiers.
[16:27:10] Ethan King: I will be attempting to reconnect with old resistance groups, then we can think of fighting Combine units.
[16:27:20] Ethan King: And Paul...
[16:27:26] Paul-Henri Cartier: Hi
[16:27:40] Ethan King: To you, watch what you say around these parts...me and you are both under...something of an obligation.
[16:27:51] Paul-Henri Cartier: Right, okay
[16:27:58] Ethan King: I am sure you atleast somewhat understand, that many are listening in on us.

[16:29:08] Ethan King: Especially me.
[16:29:10] Jared Marshall: Nothing here will get out.

[16:29:35] Ethan King: /me nodded, "Good, I am putting a lot of faith on you two...I have learned such things are a mistake, prove me wrong."
[16:29:45] Jared Marshall: Understood.
[16:30:21] Ethan King: And as stated, for the moment we won't be moving into the Outlands, there is no need to go into such a dangerous land as of right now.
[16:31:02] Ethan King: Right...briefing is finished, I want you two to be on scavenging.

[17:49:54] Paul-Henri Cartier: not now. Right, this here is King and I'm Paul-Henri
[17:49:56] Simon Amanda: You certanly look like
[17:50:16] Ethan King: /me nodded, "Yeah, but we've left that kind of life a while ago."
[17:50:23] Simon Amanda: /me chuckles
[17:50:25] Simon Amanda: Huh
[17:50:27] Ethan King: Well....I was barely in that life.
[17:50:37] Ethan King: Single day of Conscription, and too much rebel shit.
[17:50:49] Simon Amanda: Well all I'm doin is forging shit and giving them for some good boy points
[17:50:59] Simon Amanda: So I can get some better rations
[17:51:00] Paul-Henri Cartier: haha, smart
[17:51:07] Simon Amanda: the i1 union fell for it
[17:51:16] Simon Amanda: Not the smartest one in the group 'eh?
[17:51:21] Paul-Henri Cartier: UNIONs aren't known for being smart
[17:51:26] Ethan King: /me chuckled, "Gotcha, and likely not."
[17:51:35] Simon Amanda: .// oh thank god I dont need a filet down here
[17:51:38] Ethan King: Indeed, UNION isn't much of an intelligent division.
[17:51:39] Paul-Henri Cartier: You know the phrase jack of all trades, master of none?
[17:51:44] Paul-Henri Cartier: They're just shit at every trade
[17:51:57] Simon Amanda: /me is laughin
[17:52:05] Paul-Henri Cartier: Need a filter?
[17:52:08] Simon Amanda: .// i do need a filter
[17:52:19] Paul-Henri Cartier: /me holds out a FANCY filter
[17:52:20] Simon Amanda: /me slaps on a new one after taking the old one out
[17:52:24] Ethan King: I'm...
[17:52:25] Simon Amanda: Ah no need I found these OTA ones
[17:52:32] Ethan King: Actually not lookin' too good on my filter.
[17:52:36] Ethan King: Could I take that OTA one?
[17:52:42] Paul-Henri Cartier: I got an OTA one
[17:52:45] Ethan King: Ah
[17:53:05] Paul-Henri Cartier: I miss the air not being toxic
[17:53:06] Ethan King: /me nodded, "Appreciated"
[17:53:08] Ethan King: Same 
[17:53:21] Ethan King: Good times, before all this shit.
[17:53:27] Simon Amanda: I can agree
[17:53:43] Simon Amanda: Just the freedom of going on on the street and not having to wear a gasmask
[17:53:57] Ethan King: And like....actually not walking in a sewer in a hazmat all day.
[17:53:59] Paul-Henri Cartier: or, the freedom of going out on the street
[17:54:07] Simon Amanda: Yeah... that
[17:54:13] Ethan King: Yeah, me and Paul have long since lost that luxury.
[17:54:38] Simon Amanda: Well I'm guessin you guys would need new ID's to like go on the streets in regular clothin?
[17:54:51] Paul-Henri Cartier: I got an ID, but..
[17:55:03] Paul-Henri Cartier: I try not to go on the surface, I still have the whats-it
[17:55:05] Ethan King: I have one....but it....well it's mine but also not mine.
[17:55:12] Paul-Henri Cartier: biosignal, so if it reactivates, they can track me
[17:55:28] Ethan King: Yeah, best we keep you underground and away from prying eyes.
[17:55:29] Simon Amanda: And I supose its not easy to take it out?
[17:55:39] Simon Amanda: If it can be taken out
[17:55:49] Ethan King: /atc This is ATC, your request has been <c=255,0,0>DENIED</c>
[17:56:06] Ethan King: Those biosignal chips....where are they located?
[17:56:12] Paul-Henri Cartier: uhhh, not sure
[17:56:22] Paul-Henri Cartier: Think it's next to my heart, wedged in there
[17:56:27] Ethan King: Ah.....not great.
[17:56:41] Simon Amanda: That can be removed by a somewhat good helix or surgeon
[17:56:54] Ethan King: Affirmative, but we have the luxury of neither.
[17:56:57] Paul-Henri Cartier: would be hard to convince a helix to do it
[17:57:03] Paul-Henri Cartier: and a surgeon? I'd probably get sepsis
[17:57:13] Paul-Henri Cartier: honestly, with a helix too
[17:57:14] Simon Amanda: Honestly I had this idea to just fake my way into the UU and just divert supplies as a UNION or some shit
[17:57:18] Paul-Henri Cartier: CCA medical facilities are... bare
[17:57:35] Paul-Henri Cartier: and painful, a lot of the time
[17:57:48] Simon Amanda: There is one QM 98280 or... what was his numbers? I think he wouldn't even care if I would do that
[17:57:57] Simon Amanda: as long those things are not used against him
[17:58:08] Ethan King: QrM?
[17:58:11] Simon Amanda: Yeah
[17:58:24] Ethan King: Gotcha, we'll see.
[17:58:39] Ethan King: Maybe we can get him on our sides, having one of those helping us would be a powerful tool.
[17:58:49] Ethan King: /looc side*
[17:58:55] Simon Amanda: Well with this round to drop off the contrabands
[17:59:05] Simon Amanda: I will have more than enough good birl points to join the CCA up
[17:59:08] Paul-Henri Cartier: i knew a QM once, he was a nice guy
[17:59:11] Paul-Henri Cartier: 98240?
[17:59:16] Simon Amanda: Yeah 98240
[17:59:30] Ethan King: Heh....small world.
[17:59:43] Ethan King: Wait....
[17:59:47] Paul-Henri Cartier: yup
[17:59:50] Ethan King: Fuck....
[17:59:56] Simon Amanda: .// chemk my lp for once Lazzy hurr durr
[18:00:04] Ethan King: /me chuckled under his mask, "Christ..."
[18:00:04] Paul-Henri Cartier: know his name, too
[18:00:21] Simon Amanda: He seems like a reasoneable guy
[18:00:22] Ethan King: Right, we'll have to talk about that later Paul.
[18:00:26] Paul-Henri Cartier: Sadly, it might be hard to actually convince him
[18:00:42] Carson Copper<STEAM_0:0:52468151> changed their name to OTA.C08-ECHO:OWS.69173
[18:00:46] Simon Amanda: Well he is fairly old.. no one usually lives that long 
[18:00:50] Paul-Henri Cartier: to fully defect, QrMs get a considerable amount of brainwashing, and it's not like... politicial indoctrination, it's freaky scifi shit
[18:00:53] Simon Amanda: From what I could tell from his movement
[18:00:57] Simon Amanda: he aint a young one
[18:01:03] Paul-Henri Cartier: he's like... 50
[18:01:18] OTA.C08-ECHO:OWS.69173<STEAM_0:0:52468151> changed their name to Carson Copper
[18:01:21] Simon Amanda: Well then he can be bought with alcohol
[18:01:26] Simon Amanda: with the good stuff
[18:01:28] Simon Amanda: non UU 
[18:01:30] Paul-Henri Cartier: mm, or idea
[18:01:44] Paul-Henri Cartier: you see him around, tell him 363 said hi. He'll probably know what it means
[18:01:51] Simon Amanda: Alright 
[18:01:56] Simon Amanda: .// there aint mynots AAAA
[18:02:13] Ethan King: Right...
[18:02:35] Ethan King: Having a QrM will be a great asset, we'll have to talk about this later.
[18:02:42] Paul-Henri Cartier: mhm
[18:03:04] Paul-Henri Cartier: I always liked him
[18:03:28] Simon Amanda: Well we could talk about meeting up around here next week 
[18:03:54] Simon Amanda: I aint gona ask for a radio or anythin to contact you guys.. it would be bold and too dangerious
[18:03:55] Client "moe" connected.
[18:04:05] Paul-Henri Cartier: we don't even have spare radios
[18:04:16] Ethan King: Yeah, don't go too far.
[18:04:17] Ethan King: /atc This is ATC, your request has been <lg>GRANTED</lg>
[18:04:19] Paul-Henri Cartier: it's literally just me and him, handhelds are hard to come by
[18:04:29] Paul-Henri Cartier: although..
[18:04:42] Paul-Henri Cartier: you want a knife?
[18:04:45] Ethan King: Talk to him, find out how far gone he is, or how flexible he is...if he seems a lost cause then stop your advances.
[18:05:01] Ethan King: If not? try and set up a meeting date.
[18:05:08] Simon Amanda: I can't take it honestly... if I get searched after all this contraband I'm gona give em I'l be hanged or worse
[18:05:17] Paul-Henri Cartier: fair enough

[22:18:47] Derek Williams: If I were to dump the whole bucket of soap and water into the box, much of the equipment would be damaged. Something may have gone wrong. Soap clogging up the equipment or the possibility of getting into their insides.
[22:18:59] Alex Palovichov: And yet...
[22:19:04] Alex Palovichov: Dumping it into the fluid...
[22:19:04] Derek Williams: The extractors would maybe even float in the box depending on the water level.
[22:19:05] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: /me would walk over to the Civvie, "Stop the bickering, back to work."
[22:19:06] Alex Palovichov: Doesn't clog it
