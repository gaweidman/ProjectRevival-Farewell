[22:58:16] CAC.C14-CRM.17000 to admins: Or something like that. Maybe I'm just tired or something. It seems sorta strange to me to have someone who has OTA HC can also be sorta CCA HC- eh nevermind. I'm gonna drop it.

[23:33:42] UU-SeC.14: /chargiveitem sec kit
[23:33:58] CCA.C14-HELIX.EpU.33698 to admins: Yeah, that could work. It vends items but only has a certain amount. It restocks every now and again, probably once a hour or hour and a half
[23:34:03] CCA.C14-HELIX.EpU.33698 to admins: hour and a half
[23:34:10] UU-SeC.14 to admins: yeah. and we make restocking an ic TASK
[23:34:12] UU-SeC.14 to admins: IC task*
[23:34:30] CCA.C14-HELIX.EpU.33698 to admins: Bet. CWU workshift possibly...? Could be risky tho
[23:34:43] CCA.C14-HELIX.EpU.33698 to admins: Actually, this kinda works.
[23:34:43] UU-SeC.14 to admins: yeah that's gonna be a no from me dog. i'd just make units do it so they get some psassiveRP
[23:34:47] CCA.C14-HELIX.EpU.33698 to admins: Ah.
[23:34:49] UU-SeC.14 to admins: yeah
[23:34:52] UU-SeC.14 to admins: but units doing it, ell yeah
[23:35:03] CCA.C14-HELIX.EpU.33698 to admins: But we could link this to CWU actually affecting the state of the server.
[23:35:12] CCA.C14-HELIX.EpU.33698 to admins: Maybe not with them transporting supplies
[23:35:13] UU-SeC.14 to admins: explain
[23:35:35] CCA.C14-HELIX.EpU.33698 to admins: But when they actually do a workshift, certain types of supplies can be made, wether it is a part of something, such as grubbing
[23:35:41] CCA.C14-HELIX.EpU.33698 to admins: Or just making bullet casing
[23:36:07] CCA.C14-HELIX.EpU.33698 to admins: If they fail, it can cripple the Combine in some way.
[23:36:08] UU-SeC.14 to admins: oh, no, i agre they do that too
[23:36:18] CCA.C14-HELIX.EpU.33698: Congrats on your promotion.
[23:36:21] CCA.C14-UNION.i2.98240: thanks
[23:36:26] UU-SeC.14 to admins: yeah, that would be for CWU factory though. but that also we means we have to raise the bar for either
[23:36:33] CCA.C14-HELIX.EpU.33698 to admins: Yeah.
[23:36:44] UU-SeC.14 to admins: be it a samll LP requirement, or a small stat requirement
[23:36:49] CCA.C14-HELIX.EpU.33698 to admins: Yeah.
[23:37:11] CCA.C14-HELIX.EpU.33698 to admins: Tbf, we can do bullet casings pretty easily
[23:37:20] UU-SeC.14: //yeah
[23:37:23] UU-SeC.14: //FUCk
[23:37:25] CCA.C14-HELIX.EpU.33698 to admins: We have the forge for burning metal down. We can program a mold tool
[23:37:26] UU-SeC.14 to admins: it's literally just metal casting
[23:37:28] UU-SeC.14 to admins: exactly
[23:37:38] UU-SeC.14 to admins: also, don't take this the wrong way, id on't mean it to be a dick
