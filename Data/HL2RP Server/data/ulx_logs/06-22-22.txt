[19:33:06] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Will that be it?
[19:33:09] Matthew Miller: Yep

[19:33:42] Alex Palovichov: From the sewers!
[19:33:43] Matthew Miller: /chardesc
[19:33:48] Alex Palovichov: Same shots that I heard while cleaning
[19:33:50] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: You heard this from the corner store?
[19:33:59] Alex Palovichov: Yeah, behind it by the ICT station
[19:34:10] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Alright.
[19:34:18] Matthew Miller: Hello?
[19:34:22] Alex Palovichov: I was dealing with that headcrab, and BOOM! 3 shots rang out from behind a Bio-Locked door!
[19:34:34] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: /r Shots fired reported at the infestation control station. Allegedly a revolver, 3 shots.
[19:34:38] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: /radio Will do further investigation.
[19:34:51] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: If we can find any evidence of wrongdoing, I'll credit you with loyalist points. Apply
[19:34:56] Alex Palovichov: /apply
[19:35:14] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Thank you for your loyalty. Check back at a later time if I don't find you to let you know.
[19:35:15] Matthew Miller: /y Anyone here?
[19:35:17] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Is that it?
[19:35:25] Alex Palovichov: Who ever shot shouldn't be able to get past, we set up some Infestation control fields down there
[19:35:43] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Those are inactive as far as I'm aware, but noted.
[19:35:46] Alex Palovichov: So unless he has either CWU or CCA access, he shouldn't be able to get out from the ICT station...
[19:35:47] Alex Palovichov: What?
[19:35:53] Alex Palovichov: We set em up yesterday!
[19:36:04] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: I didn't realize they were powered on. I must have missed a memo.
[19:36:17] Alex Palovichov: I just hope they are still there...
[19:36:25] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: I'll have someone look at it.
[19:36:25] Alex Palovichov: Should have the elevator leading down blocked...
[19:36:40] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: The elevator there is specifically for infestation control, we need it to get into the sewers.
[19:36:46] Alex Palovichov: It does!
[19:36:49] Alex Palovichov: Right into it!
[19:36:51] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Right.
[19:37:06] Alex Palovichov: Me and a workshift went down there with a...what was it, a QrM?
[19:37:11] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: A quartermaster, yes.
[19:37:19] Alex Palovichov: Yeah! And whatever he called a Grunt?
[19:37:26] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Right, an OHZ.
[19:37:30] Alex Palovichov: Yeah!
[19:37:33] Alex Palovichov: I think...
[19:37:53] Alex Palovichov: Also...I have some...problematic news as well...
[19:37:54] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: I'll send a message up the ladder and learn more about it. Time is sensitive with looking into these gunshots, so will that be all?
[19:37:56] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Hm?
[19:38:03] Alex Palovichov: Sewer Infestation is growing
[19:38:12] Alex Palovichov: Got reports of... Houndeyes being down there
[19:38:22] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Tripeds?
[19:38:27] Alex Palovichov: More "zombies" and what some Civs call... "Zombines"?
[19:38:34] Alex Palovichov: Yeah? If thats what you call em
[19:38:53] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Right, the necrotics. Sounds like the life in there is spreading, but we don't want them spreading their nastiness around the sewers.
[19:39:08] Alex Palovichov: They were leaving them too!
[19:39:10] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Last thing we need is more problems to deal with.
[19:39:17] Alex Palovichov: I saw zombies on my way to the theatre for cleanup duty
[19:39:25] Alex Palovichov: Out in the Construction zone!
[19:39:26] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: In District 4, the construction zone?
[19:39:29] Alex Palovichov: Yeah!
[19:39:31] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: I saw a few of them myself.
[19:39:39] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Tighter security on the sewers may be in order.
[19:39:43] Alex Palovichov: Well...
[19:39:51] Alex Palovichov: I could try set up another workshift...
[19:39:57] Alex Palovichov: Though, It would take time
[19:40:05] Alex Palovichov: Need more than myself for it...
[19:40:10] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: If you want to do that, it would be appreciated, and compensated by the union.
[19:40:15] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: That is to say, paid.
[19:40:20] Alex Palovichov: By myself?
[19:40:23] Alex Palovichov: That would take...
[19:40:26] Alex Palovichov: Erm...
[19:40:31] Alex Palovichov: Quite a while
[19:40:37] Alex Palovichov: Without any protection...even longer
[19:40:37] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: No, I'm saying if you want to start organizing it and make the pencil pushers have easier work, it would be appreciated.
[19:40:39] Matthew Miller: // this hospital rp is very accurate waiting in the wait room for 2 hours
