[12:32:57] Kal'Taar: // my game froze up
[12:33:06] Ethan King: // We're in the arcade 
[12:33:10] Jimmy 'Jim' Dexon: So you and a vortiguant posting up in here?
[12:33:18] Ethan King: Negative, it's temporary.
[12:33:25] Jimmy 'Jim' Dexon: Nice spot
[12:33:36] Ethan King: Indeed, it is....almost comfy.
[12:33:52] Jimmy 'Jim' Dexon: I heard about a boat in shell city. That will take you to the outlands
[12:33:57] Ethan King: Though, those who lead our kind of lives usually can't live in comfort for very long.
[12:34:00] Ethan King: Indeed
[12:34:27] Ethan King: The Outlands is a bad place to be, especially considering I was living in it for a few years.
[12:34:33] Ethan King: Terrible place, terrible place.
[12:34:41] Ethan King: Living amongst the rats in these sewers is far better.
[12:34:46] Kal'Taar: A poor place for humans, but life prospers there regardless.
[12:35:03] Ethan King: /me nods to Kal, "Affirm, Antlions especially..."
[12:35:15] Ethan King: They are....a powerful enemy.
[12:35:22] Ethan King: And from stories I've heard, a powerful ally.
[12:35:32] Kal'Taar: The Vortigaunts have hunted the antlions for eons.
[12:35:41] Jimmy 'Jim' Dexon: I heard about someone who can control the antlions
[12:36:16] Ethan King: I believe Vortigaunts have learned how to control Antlions, especially considering their relationship.
[12:36:30] Kal'Taar: Indeed.
[12:37:13] Ethan King: /me nods, huffing, "Now....Jim, what do you intend on doing in the future? I have made it my duty right now to assist refugees where I can."
[12:37:33] Ethan King: If you require my assistance, I've no problem with lending a hand.
[12:37:35] Ethan King: However
[12:37:52] Ethan King: For my assistance, there's always a price, such as that AI-2 I used on you.
[12:38:01] Jimmy 'Jim' Dexon: Yeah thanks for that by the way
[12:38:20] Ethan King: /me nods, "Don't thank me, I intend to get that back when you find a replacement."
[12:38:26] Jimmy 'Jim' Dexon: If im being honest iv always just wanted a purpose. A cause something to fight for
[12:38:35] Kal'Taar: // is there a way I can set my speed so im not constantly jogging
[12:38:46] Ethan King: // Walking speed is fine?
[12:38:57] Kal'Taar: // yeah i just dont want to hold alt all the time
[12:39:08] Jimmy 'Jim' Dexon: A way to help destroy the combine
[12:39:10] Ethan King: // I mean, no, talk to Q 
[12:39:25] Jimmy 'Jim' Dexon: Even if thats just small things like destroying combine tech
[12:39:58] Ethan King: /me leans forward, chuckling to himself, "I am aware of such things, destroying the Combine...feels like it's in the realm of possibilities with what I've been through."
[12:40:06] Ethan King: However
[12:40:30] Ethan King: I am unable to tell you these things right now, as Kal might know, you are never truly aware of what might be listening in.
[12:40:52] Kal'Taar: There are many things, many paths, that one can take.
[12:41:39] Ethan King: Yes, and....I have attempt to follow the path layed out before me, even if it's...a difficult one.
[12:42:05] Jimmy 'Jim' Dexon: .// dont you dare go on pandora
