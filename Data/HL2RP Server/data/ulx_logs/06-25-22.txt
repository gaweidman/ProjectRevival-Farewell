[00:13:00] Alex Palovichov: /looc If you want to help
[00:13:07] Leviticus Zombie: /looc ok
[00:13:11] Alex Palovichov: Basically ICT event
[00:13:16] Leviticus Zombie<STEAM_0:1:70789676> changed their name to Karlos Wilsono
[00:13:16] Alex Palovichov: On a large scale
[00:13:40] Alex Palovichov: I just need a bit of someone elses opinion on some stuff
[00:13:59] Alex Palovichov: Though I won't spoil the event for you if you don't want to help out, thats all good
[00:14:04] Karlos Wilsono: sure sure. gives good opportunity for me to inquire ic about ict.
[00:14:14] Alex Palovichov: Alr, 
[00:14:26] Karlos Wilsono: but yeah all ears
[00:14:29] Alex Palovichov: Alright
[00:14:31] Alex Palovichov: So
[00:14:40] Alex Palovichov: You alright with some spoilers for the event?
[00:14:47] Karlos Wilsono: sure
[00:14:51] Alex Palovichov: Alrighty
[00:14:54] Alex Palovichov: Basically
[00:15:09] Karlos Wilsono<STEAM_0:1:70789676> spawned model models/props_c17/furnituredrawer001a_chunk06.mdl
[00:15:20] Alex Palovichov: At some point during the event there would be a small zombie breach
[00:15:29] Alex Palovichov: Though do note that the event will happen at any time
[00:15:30] Karlos Wilsono: Oooo
[00:15:38] Karlos Wilsono: As true events should occur
[00:15:42] Alex Palovichov: Exactly
[00:15:45] Karlos Wilsono: Never let the populace know
[00:15:53] Karlos Wilsono: Always surprise. Otherwise, it isnt a true event.
[00:15:55] Alex Palovichov: The most people would know is the CPs and a few hints to it starting
[00:16:05] Alex Palovichov:  Basically
[00:16:20] Alex Palovichov: I go to CPs, warn em a bit of increased infestation numbers
[00:16:21] Karlos Wilsono<STEAM_0:1:70789676> changed their name to Leviticus Zombie
[00:16:22] Alex Palovichov: That kinda stuff
[00:16:30] Alex Palovichov: And then it would later begin
[00:16:37] Alex Palovichov: I just need a good place FOR the breach
[00:16:37] Leviticus Zombie: Anyone in the right place at the right time gets the hint
[00:16:43] Leviticus Zombie: Follow.
[00:16:45] Alex Palovichov: Exactly
[00:17:04] Leviticus Zombie: option 1
[00:17:05] Alex Palovichov: Hmm
[00:17:18] Leviticus Zombie: two down there
[00:17:21] Alex Palovichov: Ah okay
[00:17:27] Leviticus Zombie: There is also a connected sewer system
[00:17:31] Alex Palovichov: Cause I either want it as a Civ seeing it then reporting it
[00:17:32] Alex Palovichov: OR 
[00:17:33] Leviticus Zombie: That may be used.
[00:17:35] Alex Palovichov: A CP noticing it
[00:17:39] Alex Palovichov: ORRR me noticing it
[00:17:47] Leviticus Zombie: I can certainly assist with being noticed.
[00:17:55] Alex Palovichov: Cause I want it where I give the signal for when to begin, but not WHEN the zombie would spawn
[00:18:04] Alex Palovichov: So at any point a zombie could spawn
[00:18:04] Leviticus Zombie: I have made it this far as a zombie. I can make my way around.
[00:18:24] Alex Palovichov: If you want to help...
[00:18:31] Alex Palovichov: That would be very helpful to me and Q
[00:18:36] Leviticus Zombie: I can act as the smart one.
[00:18:42] Leviticus Zombie: After all a zombie bot..
[00:18:54] Alex Palovichov: Cause all we want is the Zombie to be noticed
[00:18:55] Leviticus Zombie: Acts as a true zombie. I can be evasive.
[00:18:58] Alex Palovichov: Maybe more than one
[00:19:00] Leviticus Zombie: Keep the city on its toes.
[00:19:08] Alex Palovichov: Cause it starts with a small breach
[00:19:14] Leviticus Zombie: Headcrabs...
[00:19:17] Alex Palovichov: And Ends in a large ICT Incursion into the Sewers
[00:19:19] Client "Mr.Ganar" connected.
[00:19:32] Alex Palovichov: Its gonna be a bit bigger than you think
[00:19:42] Alex Palovichov: It'll cover the sewer
[00:19:56] Leviticus Zombie: Well, it must be big. To stay true to rp at least.
[00:20:00] Alex Palovichov: Indeed
[00:20:03] Alex Palovichov: I'll show you
[00:20:11] Alex Palovichov: Starts with a breach
[00:20:36] Alex Palovichov: I tell CPs n shit, that the Infestation levels in the sewers have sky rocketed and if we don't deal with it now, the whole city could be infested 
[00:20:57] Leviticus Zombie: good...
[00:20:57] Alex Palovichov: Then I get me some "free labour" and go down there in a attempt to clear the infestation
[00:21:07] Leviticus Zombie: so..
[00:21:09] Alex Palovichov: With a escort of course
[00:21:17] Leviticus Zombie: you have ic scanners in the sewer, yes?
[00:21:21] Alex Palovichov: Yes
[00:21:24] Client "Mr.Ganar" spawned in server <STEAM_0:0:80909581> (took 125 seconds).
[00:21:37] Leviticus Zombie: Why not make their mission to simply check them manually. They have shut down.
[00:21:51] Dropped "Mr.Ganar" from server<STEAM_0:0:80909581>
[00:22:00] Alex Palovichov: There is more than just cleaning 
[00:22:00] Leviticus Zombie: With assistance from one or two CP
[00:22:22] Leviticus Zombie: Allowing the current players in rp to witness the beginning.
[00:22:28] Alex Palovichov: Basically we go to clean, then we also do some extra stuff down there which includes fixing scanners, fixing fields n shit
[00:22:44] Alex Palovichov: While also being attacked by waves of infestation
[00:22:45] Leviticus Zombie: I see now.
[00:22:49] Alex Palovichov: Which is just zombies n shit
[00:22:55] Alex Palovichov: Maybe some antlions mixed in
[00:23:11] Leviticus Zombie: Player infestation right?
[00:23:16] Alex Palovichov: Player and NPC
[00:23:34] Alex Palovichov: We would rather have player, but adding NPC wouldn't...shouldn't ruin the experience
[00:23:41] Leviticus Zombie: In a turn based rp server...
[00:23:45] Leviticus Zombie: Real tiume bots....
[00:23:47] Leviticus Zombie: time
[00:23:48] Alex Palovichov: Ah fuck...
[00:23:49] Alex Palovichov: True
[00:23:53] Alex Palovichov: Well shit...
[00:23:56] Leviticus Zombie: Unless
[00:24:00] Alex Palovichov: Then that is a slight problem
[00:24:02] Leviticus Zombie: Their thinking is turned off.
[00:24:08] Alex Palovichov: That could work!
[00:24:14] Leviticus Zombie: Allowing for a scripted one shot kill a cp makes,
[00:24:29] Leviticus Zombie: Or perhaps a cluster of ai disabled bots.
[00:24:29] Alex Palovichov: Indeed, that could work in that scenario...
[00:24:37] Leviticus Zombie: being eliminated by a grenade?
[00:24:43] Alex Palovichov: Hmm
[00:24:55] Leviticus Zombie: Then, behind the cluster come the player infestation
[00:25:09] Alex Palovichov: The problem is...we don't know if enough player zombies would be available
[00:25:19] Leviticus Zombie: Hm..
[00:25:21] Leviticus Zombie: True..
[00:25:23] Alex Palovichov: So we may HAVE to resort to it
[00:25:29] Alex Palovichov: But Idk, this is all early stage stuff
[00:25:34] Alex Palovichov: Shit is subject to change
[00:25:38] Leviticus Zombie: That is why we have discussion like these
[00:25:42] Alex Palovichov: Exactly
[00:25:46] Alex Palovichov: I need to speak with Q about it too
[00:25:50] Leviticus Zombie: Nothing is permanent.
[00:25:53] Alex Palovichov: Indeed
[00:25:54] Leviticus Zombie: Brainstorming.
[00:26:09] Alex Palovichov: Cause the whole idea may be changed too
[00:26:10] Alex Palovichov: But idk
[00:26:17] Leviticus Zombie: If you'd like, add me to a group chat with you and him. that way i can pitch in while at work.
[00:26:25] Alex Palovichov: Sure
[00:26:38] Leviticus Zombie: I am devoted to aiding PR anyway I can.
[00:26:46] Alex Palovichov: Me too.
[00:26:55] Leviticus Zombie: As you have noticed I love RP. I can tell you do too.
[00:27:09] Leviticus Zombie: We seem quite fluent in odd rp scenarios.
[00:27:24] Leviticus Zombie: So I am sure this project will be cheese. Once the kinks are worked out.
[00:27:45] Alex Palovichov: I hope so
[00:27:52] Alex Palovichov: I sent you a friend request on discord 
[00:28:09] Alex Palovichov: We could then begin "brainstorming"
[00:28:21] Leviticus Zombie: Know so. Confidence goes far.
[00:28:37] Leviticus Zombie: Our issue currently stands with lack of player infested.
[00:28:41] Leviticus Zombie: Perhaps..
[00:28:49] Leviticus Zombie: We dont need many player infested.
[00:28:55] Alex Palovichov: Oh?
[00:29:12] Leviticus Zombie: Just a few, moderately skilled infested that hatched from a brood.
[00:29:33] Leviticus Zombie: Those infested are brood mothers.
[00:29:45] Leviticus Zombie: They leave a paper trail of infested bots.
[00:29:48] Alex Palovichov: Ooh...Then we could also add a few spots around the sewers that we could clean and slowly have less and less zombies spawn...
[00:30:06] Alex Palovichov: Kinda like small "infestation pods"
[00:30:10] Leviticus Zombie: Yes.
[00:30:15] Leviticus Zombie: Brooding hotspots if you will.
[00:30:18] Alex Palovichov: Exactly
[00:30:33] Leviticus Zombie: Depending on how many groups of bots we decide on. If I am in the equation. I hope I am helping lol
[00:30:51] Alex Palovichov: Hopefully lol
[00:31:21] Leviticus Zombie: Because we technically could continue the event based on progress made by citizens and or cps. also icts.
[00:31:23] Alex Palovichov: I just need Q to accept my friend request then we could get this set up
[00:31:40] Leviticus Zombie: Awesome. I love being apart of things like these.
[00:31:56] Alex Palovichov: Lmao, I love trying to get the whole thing set up
[00:32:06] Leviticus Zombie: Exactly.
[00:32:21] Leviticus Zombie: Hey, you didnt stash 500 tokens somewhere right>
[00:32:21] Alex Palovichov: We could also brainstorm certain scenarios to happen if lets say CPs fail and the ICT n shit have to evac
[00:32:29] Alex Palovichov: Did I? no
[00:32:29] Leviticus Zombie: Yes.
[00:32:34] Leviticus Zombie: Oh.
[00:32:35] Client "Mr.Ganar" connected.
[00:32:37] Alex Palovichov: Why?
[00:32:43] Leviticus Zombie: I found a stash of 500 tokens.
[00:32:46] Alex Palovichov: Oh lol
[00:33:00] Alex Palovichov: Anyway
[00:33:07] Leviticus Zombie: That is indeed a good thought.
[00:33:17] Leviticus Zombie: Come come
[00:33:19] Alex Palovichov: Though maybe we could have even more different endings to the event
[00:33:47] Leviticus Zombie: There is this access point as well.
[00:33:56] Leviticus Zombie: Where potential infested may crawl up.
[00:34:01] Alex Palovichov: Ik
[00:34:05] Alex Palovichov: But...
[00:34:06] Alex Palovichov: How
[00:34:22] Alex Palovichov: Thats my question...They're zombies...
[00:34:23] Client "Mr.Ganar" spawned in server <STEAM_0:0:80909581> (took 108 seconds).
[00:34:31] Leviticus Zombie: It is totally thesable that undead climb on top of one another.
[00:34:37] Alex Palovichov: Yeah...
[00:34:40] Alex Palovichov: I guess...
[00:34:58] Alex Palovichov: But even then...You would need quite a amount for such a little climbing through
[00:35:01] Leviticus Zombie: However now that I think about it, this may serve better for players to utilize during the event.
[00:35:11] Alex Palovichov: Indeed
[00:35:31] Leviticus Zombie: The sewer system connects to a hidden room as well, yknow.
[00:35:34] Dropped "Mr.Ganar" from server<STEAM_0:0:80909581>
[00:35:35] Alex Palovichov: I was thinking of 3 spots that the ICT would have to clean
[00:35:45] Alex Palovichov: The GG room?
[00:35:50] Alex Palovichov: I know the sewers quite well
[00:35:55] Leviticus Zombie: Where the wall lifts up yeah?
[00:36:01] Alex Palovichov: Also I know of the GG room IC too
[00:36:13] Leviticus Zombie: Fake wall yeah?
[00:36:13] Alex Palovichov: And yes that thing
[00:36:46] Leviticus Zombie: May serve useful for players to utilize in the event of overwhelming failure.
[00:36:50] Leviticus Zombie: So where are the spots?
[00:37:39] Alex Palovichov: Heres one
[00:37:49] Alex Palovichov: Nice and large area
[00:37:57] Alex Palovichov: Zombies could come in from 2 ways
[00:37:58] Leviticus Zombie: Nice. Good choice. large. no easy way out besides latter.
[00:38:04] Alex Palovichov: And this
[00:38:38] Alex Palovichov: Over there
[00:38:46] Alex Palovichov: In that fort kinda
[00:38:57] Alex Palovichov: Quite large up close
[00:39:00] Leviticus Zombie: Ah. That was my home in a previous server as a vort.
[00:39:11] Leviticus Zombie: It is a nice area for combat.
[00:39:11] Alex Palovichov: And soon it will be a infestation nest
[00:39:17] Alex Palovichov: Next spot
[00:40:15] Alex Palovichov: Here
[00:40:21] Leviticus Zombie: oh yeah
[00:40:27] Alex Palovichov: Which would then strech into that room down there
[00:40:27] Leviticus Zombie: monitor room
[00:40:39] Alex Palovichov: Hyh
[00:41:13] Leviticus Zombie: i see the custom asset
[00:41:18] Leviticus Zombie: Fits well.
[00:41:22] Alex Palovichov: It would start in that large ladder room, and be in here too
[00:41:35] Leviticus Zombie: Good..
[00:41:48] Alex Palovichov: Thats basically all I have for the event currently
[00:42:07] Alex Palovichov: When I speak with Q n shit and see what we could do, I can figure out what would fit more
[00:42:25] Leviticus Zombie: I think the idea is nice. Where the infested pods are should be where the lot of them spawn with fewer and fewer paper trailing behind, perhaps.
[00:42:45] Leviticus Zombie: Like a bird following bread crumbs.
[00:42:55] Leviticus Zombie: A group of ic players follow the infested.
[00:43:05] Leviticus Zombie: To their brood lairs.
[00:43:11] Alex Palovichov: Yeah, that could work
[00:43:37] Leviticus Zombie: However the players should be at an advantage. Being able to pick each one off in a way that is safe for turn based rp.
[00:43:54] Leviticus Zombie: However the deeper they dwell, the more difficult the rp becomes.
[00:44:04] Alex Palovichov: Indeed
[00:44:13] Leviticus Zombie: Air filled with spores, affecting crit success..
[00:44:29] Alex Palovichov: Cause it all really counts on what kind of turns are played, it is extremely based on the combat and what kind of ending the event will have
[00:44:55] Alex Palovichov: If CPs die, ICT have to do (blank) and (blank) in order to (blank)
[00:45:10] Leviticus Zombie: Right. We cant have players rushing. They must be heared by cp, or if that fails, ict.
[00:45:16] Leviticus Zombie: hearded.
[00:45:21] Alex Palovichov: Exactly
[00:45:32] Alex Palovichov: And if ICT dies, (Blank) will happen to (blank)
[00:45:33] Leviticus Zombie: if ict fails, perhaps oct.
[00:45:46] Leviticus Zombie: however im unsure of the possibility.
[00:45:57] Leviticus Zombie: however yes you make a good point
[00:46:22] Alex Palovichov: Indeed, I just want it where the people in the event have a real chance to change the ending of the event
[00:46:25] Leviticus Zombie: there must be a point where if all else fails, the event may last longer. affecting civillian and cp life for a certain amount of time
[00:46:37] Alex Palovichov: Indeed
[00:46:45] Leviticus Zombie: thickening the lore in PR
[00:46:48] Alex Palovichov: Possibly have blocks become locked down due to infestation
[00:47:03] Alex Palovichov: And it escaping from the sewers
[00:47:10] Leviticus Zombie: yes.
[00:47:22] Alex Palovichov: Hell, maybe even rebels could have a say in it
[00:47:38] Leviticus Zombie: Perhaps. However if we are speaking rebels...
[00:47:41] Alex Palovichov: Maybe if rebels do this, then it could change the ending in this way
[00:48:56] Leviticus Zombie: Q may want to ponder how vorts will become introduced into PR. They are currently non-existent. Perhaps the infested could bring about their arrival. However since the vorts are mainly enslaved, it wouldnt make sense unless extremely indoctrinated with CCA
[00:49:31] Leviticus Zombie: Plus, the risk involved may make the entire concept ineligable for the time being.
[00:49:39] Leviticus Zombie: hmm
[00:49:41] Alex Palovichov: Hmph
[00:49:59] Alex Palovichov: Well...only time can tell, and whenever we are able to speak with Q about it, we can get this more figured out
[00:50:18] Leviticus Zombie: Yes. After all it is him who brings about creation round these parts as we know.
[00:50:28] Leviticus Zombie: they
[00:50:30] Leviticus Zombie: them
[00:51:01] Leviticus Zombie: there are certainly almost endless possibilities.
[00:51:08] Alex Palovichov: Indeed
[00:51:26] Leviticus Zombie: I believe all events should be large, yet not so large that gordon freeman comes to play. not that he could, but you get it.
[00:51:35] Alex Palovichov: Lmao yeah
[00:51:47] Alex Palovichov: Anyway, I'm tired af, Imma get out of the sewers and get off for the night
[00:51:54] Leviticus Zombie: same.
[00:52:04] Alex Palovichov: Lets hope Q is interested in this idea
[00:52:15] Leviticus Zombie: good brainstorming. ill add you on discord. and yes, lets hope.
[00:52:19] Alex Palovichov: Yeah
[00:53:54] Alex Palovichov: /ooc alr I'm getting off for the night
[00:54:03] Alex Palovichov: /ooc Gn
