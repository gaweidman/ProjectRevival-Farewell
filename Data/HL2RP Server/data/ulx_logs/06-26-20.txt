[15:30:20] Morgan Beck teleported to James Murdoch
[15:30:20] Morgan Beck: !goto Murdoch
[15:30:26] James Murdoch: /roll
[15:30:31] Morgan Beck: /looc Do- fuckin hell
[15:30:33] James Murdoch: /looc I BETTER GET SOME GOOD SHIT FOR THAT
[15:30:38] Morgan Beck: /adminspawnmenu
[15:30:41] Lorenz Helmschmied: Ahh, hello. Sir!
[15:30:52] Lorenz Helmschmied: Is everything alright?
[15:31:15] Morgan Beck: /it You find a entire container of pills. A scratched off label is on the container, but you can make out the word Percocet.
[15:31:16] James Murdoch: He'd lift himself out the dumpster taking his wool gloves off and stuffing them into his belt German Officer style, he'd turn around and look at the man talking to him.
[15:31:27] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// That wasn't a /me lmao.
[15:31:31] Morgan Beck: /looc F
[15:31:34] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// You actually said that.
[15:31:35] James Murdoch: /looc ffs i forgot just pretend it was lol
[15:31:42] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// Alright, Bet
[15:31:50] James Murdoch: /looc void what i said
[15:31:52] James Murdoch: /me He'd lift himself out the dumpster taking his wool gloves off and stuffing them into his belt German Officer style, he'd turn around and look at the man talking to him
[15:32:00] Lorenz Helmschmied: Hm, I see. You are also attempting to "Fight the power" as one would say.
[15:32:08] James Murdoch: Haha.
[15:32:27] Lorenz Helmschmied: Well. If you ever need assistance. I'd be happy to-
[15:32:33] James Murdoch: // I dont want to apply this how do i put it in my inventory
[15:32:40] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// Hold e
[15:32:49] James Murdoch: /looc thank you for the assistance
[15:32:54] James Murdoch: Yeah I guess.
[15:33:02] James Murdoch: I'm a transfer from City-08.
[15:33:13] Lorenz Helmschmied: Well, If you need assistance with "Fighting the power" I would be happy to become....Partners as one would say.
[15:33:16] James Murdoch: I'm grateful for the Union evacuating me from that Shithole.
[15:33:25] James Murdoch: Before it blew.
[15:33:33] James Murdoch: What do you have in mind?>
[15:33:43] James Murdoch: I wouldn't be so far against the Idea I suppose.
[15:33:44] Lorenz Helmschmied: I see, Though the Union has also...how do you say.....Enslaved us.
[15:34:18] Lorenz Helmschmied: Hm, I believe arming ourselves with something more than just are own hands would be the best idea.
[15:34:23] James Murdoch: I must agree.
[15:34:27] James Murdoch: What's your name?
[15:34:43] Lorenz Helmschmied: Well before hand, All I have at the moment is this rather large Wrench.
[15:35:12] Lorenz Helmschmied: But my name is Lorenz Helmshmied. It's a pleasure to make this "Partnership" with you
[15:35:23] James Murdoch: I'm James Murdoch.
[15:35:33] James Murdoch: The feeling is mutual.
[15:35:47] Lorenz Helmschmied: I'm a rather experienced Engineer so we can arm ourselves rather...Quickly.
[15:35:55] James Murdoch: /
[15:36:07] James Murdoch: /looc let me reconigze u real quick
[15:36:15] Lorenz Helmschmied: With a little work around of course. After we've armed ourselves we may even be able to mug a unit.
[15:36:25] James Murdoch: That would be ideal.
[15:36:31] James Murdoch: They are easy targets alone.
[15:36:39] Lorenz Helmschmied: Now then, Why don't we begin this...Arming.
[15:36:56] Lorenz Helmschmied: We have plenty of cars and metal to work with.
[15:36:58] James Murdoch: /looc f3 me please
[15:37:02] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// I did?
[15:37:10] James Murdoch: /looc nope your still unkown
[15:37:35] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// Turn around and look at me again. It might not have saved.
[15:37:45] James Murdoch: /looc still not saved
[15:37:47] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// Fuck
[15:37:52] James Murdoch: /looc just do talking distance i guess
[15:37:56] James Murdoch: /looc there it is
[15:38:00] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// Bet
[15:38:05] James Murdoch: /looc can you see my name?
[15:38:09] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// ye
[15:38:17] James Murdoch: Stupid of them to leave all this shit around.
[15:38:52] James Murdoch: I managed to pick up a full bottles of painkillers from that bin, might be handy.
[15:39:09] Lorenz Helmschmied: I have a small scrap of Metal on me at the moment. We could get a rock or some wood and create something of a......Shitty axe as one would say.
[15:39:11] James Murdoch: /me He'd turn slightly raising his arm and pointing at the bin located in the corner.
[15:39:52] Morgan Beck<STEAM_0:1:52892973> used the tool ledscreen on maps/rp_city14_utopia.bsp
[15:39:58] Lorenz Helmschmied: Hm, Then we should keep Searching through these dumpsters. I'm aware of how to sharpen most items using the Floor (considering most of it's literal Concrete)
[15:40:11] James Murdoch: /looc brb
[15:40:34] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// Bet
[15:40:41] James Murdoch: /looc back
[15:40:51] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// This is my second time to ever start a rebel char by the way.
[15:41:07] James Murdoch: He'd look up hearing the Monotone female voice of the overwatch dispatcher.
[15:41:12] James Murdoch: /looc FFS
[15:41:14] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// Lmao
[15:41:28] James Murdoch: That fucking voice really gets on my nerves.
[15:42:01] Lorenz Helmschmied: Hm, Yes it does. Purhaps we should move underground. I think I know a way. After we get something of a base going we can start searching for items.
[15:42:10] James Murdoch: Sounds good to me.
[15:42:34] Lorenz Helmschmied: they even have a demolished building right near of that has plenty of rebar and concrete to use for weapon building.
[15:42:39] James Murdoch: I have an apartment on the street corner by the trainstation, we can head there and set up for now.
[15:42:43] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// Right near us*
[15:42:55] Lorenz Helmschmied: Alright, Wonderful. 
[15:43:09] James Murdoch: On my way in I noticed the floorboards were weak, creaking and cracking under the weight of the Civil Protection Officer and I's presence there.
[15:43:26] James Murdoch: We could easily pry open the floorboards and hide shit there
[15:43:27] Morgan Beck: // Hm, should I be a pigeon? Awfully tempting... There was some good perch spots in City 8, but this city def has better spots.
[15:43:35] Lorenz Helmschmied: // Bet
[15:43:49] Lorenz Helmschmied: I'm aware of a place that most units never go thats still a legal area.
[15:43:57] Morgan Beck<STEAM_0:1:52892973> changed their name to Pigeon
[15:43:58] James Murdoch: Lead the way then.
[15:44:02] Lorenz Helmschmied: Alright!
[15:44:32] Lorenz Helmschmied: Sorry, I'm rather blind. The other way!
[15:45:10] Lorenz Helmschmied: In this area. It can be used for now
[15:45:20] Lorenz Helmschmied: Maybe we can pry this open?
[15:45:44] Lorenz Helmschmied: // Imagine being a bird.
[15:45:47] James Murdoch: Yeah, it'd be best if we had some sort of pipe or something of the sorts that we could use.
[15:45:55] Pigeon: // Imagine not being a Carrier Pigeon
[15:45:59] James Murdoch: So we could pull it open.
[15:46:05] James Murdoch: // you ever played BF1
[15:46:21] Pigeon: // Yeah. Only for a few hours. Game wasn't fun for me tbh
[15:46:23] Lorenz Helmschmied: Yeah. But if you have a place that you think would be better then lead the way. By the way we also could go into the sewers.
[15:46:25] James Murdoch: // theres an amazing carrier pigeon section in that during one of the campaigns
[15:46:32] Pigeon: // Yeah, I know.
[15:46:39] James Murdoch: Alright, come on then.
[15:47:41] Lorenz Helmschmied: This is rather homely.
[15:47:44] James Murdoch: /looc its the next one along lol
[15:48:03] Lorenz Helmschmied: Hm, Wonderful.
[15:48:05] Pigeon: // tfw burned apartment has open window and now pigeon is in apartments
[15:48:10] Lorenz Helmschmied: // Bruh
[15:48:30] Lorenz Helmschmied: We can use this for when we aren't "Fighting the power" in a since.
[15:48:30] James Murdoch: I think this will do fine.
[15:48:37] Lorenz Helmschmied: Yes, It's rather nice
[15:48:51] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// brb ;-;
[15:49:16] James Murdoch: /me He'd kneel down look at the floorboards spotting one that looked particularly feeble he'd then place his fingers inbetween the cracks and attempt to pull up a part of the floorboard.
[15:50:22] James Murdoch: // bruh this ambience really scares me at times
[15:50:35] James Murdoch: // but that fucking pigeon cooing ruins it
[15:50:44] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// Back
[15:51:09] Lorenz Helmschmied: // Well, We want to scare the fuck out of people so I'm happy the ambience is big spooky
[15:51:33] Lorenz Helmschmied: // Also, Ollie I think we might need you.
[15:51:39] Pigeon: /looc Hm?
[15:51:45] James Murdoch: /roll
[15:51:53] James Murdoch: Ah fuck.
[15:51:54] Pigeon: /looc Why ya rolling?
[15:51:56] James Murdoch: You give it a shot.
[15:51:59] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// He tore a floorboard open appently.
[15:52:06] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// Apparently*
[15:52:09] James Murdoch: /looc Lifting up loose floorboard
[15:52:12] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// Ye
[15:52:30] James Murdoch: You give it a shot, I got it to budge quite a bit but it didn't pop out.
[15:52:35] Pigeon: /looc Alrighty.
[15:52:44] James Murdoch: /looc hang on wahts rollstat?
[15:52:58] Pigeon: /looc Roll using a stat modifier. Like- give me a sec
[15:53:23] James Murdoch: /looc I put a good few points into strenght does that mean i get plus points for stuff like this?
[15:53:34] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// /rollstat str. Do that
[15:53:56] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// I have ten points in Eng lmao
[15:53:58] Pigeon: /looc Back
[15:54:03] Pigeon: /looc Oof.
[15:54:15] James Murdoch: /rollstat str
[15:54:22] James Murdoch: /looc was just a test
[15:54:30] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// Yee
[15:54:31] James Murdoch: Lorenz, give this a shot.
[15:54:44] James Murdoch: // WTF
[15:54:56] James Murdoch: // You become a vort for a second lol
[15:55:02] Lorenz Helmschmied: /me Kneels down and attempts to tear open the floorboard open completely.
[15:55:04] Lorenz Helmschmied: /rollstat str
[15:55:06] Pigeon: /looc Yeah. That's the standard model for anything that needs a pill
[15:55:31] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// F, I did a bad roll ;-;
[15:55:32] Pigeon: /it The floorboard is completely resistant to your attempt. You weren't even able to get your fingers underneathe the board.
[15:55:54] Lorenz Helmschmied: hm, It seems I'm only affective in Engineering.
[15:55:59] Lorenz Helmschmied: How....Sad
[15:56:13] Lorenz Helmschmied: Purhaps we should abandon this until later?
[15:56:26] James Murdoch: Yeah.
[15:56:30] James Murdoch: Fucking stupid floorboard.
[15:56:32] Lorenz Helmschmied: I believe scavenging for items would be a better idea.
[15:56:35] Lorenz Helmschmied: /me Chuckles.
[15:56:41] Lorenz Helmschmied: Yes, It's rather sad.
[15:56:44] James Murdoch: /me he'd kick the floorboard out of spite.
[15:56:57] Pigeon: /it The pigeon was startled by the sudden kick, soon flying away
[15:57:14] James Murdoch: /me he'd be startled seeing the sudden movement of the pigeon flying awya.
[15:57:17] James Murdoch: /looc away*
[15:57:21] James Murdoch: Jesus christ that scared me.
[15:57:23] Lorenz Helmschmied: Hm, fasinating.
[15:57:35] James Murdoch: Alright, let's do what you suggested.
[15:57:35] Lorenz Helmschmied: Yes, It was rather......Startling.
[15:58:01] James Murdoch: Fucking pigeon.
[15:58:07] Lorenz Helmschmied: hm, I rather like Pigeons.
[15:58:26] James Murdoch: /looc the pigegon is our guardian angel
[15:58:30] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// exaclty
[15:58:33] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// Exactly*
[15:58:51] Lorenz Helmschmied: Plently of things to scrap.
[15:59:15] Lorenz Helmschmied: // Ollie, We need you for a moment.
[15:59:24] Pigeon: /looc Hm?
[15:59:34] James Murdoch: /looc pigeon come here for a sec
[15:59:34] Lorenz Helmschmied: // though alot of this doesn't take Rolling because it's literally right in front of us.
[15:59:46] Pigeon: /looc What are you lookin for?
[16:00:01] Pigeon: /looc What are you lookin for?
[16:00:18] Lorenz Helmschmied: // Ollie, you there?
[16:00:24] Pigeon: // Yeah, I already am here
[16:00:25] Lorenz Helmschmied: // Oh, I see
[16:00:30] Lorenz Helmschmied: // I'll wait
[16:00:52] James Murdoch: /me He'd look down at the rubble(and shitty looking texture) Noticing pieces of scrap wood and rubble. He'd look through the rubble noticing a rather sharp piece of wood he'd reach down grabbing the piece of wood and pulling it from the rubble
[16:01:09] Pigeon: /adminspawnmenu
[16:01:13] James Murdoch: /looc is this a sturdy piece of wood suitable for homocide?
[16:01:38] Pigeon: /looc Hm, that's the wrong one
[16:01:39] James Murdoch: /me He'd feel the wood attempting to bend it to feel it's weak points and see if it is a worthy weapon.
[16:01:43] Pigeon: /looc Give me a second
[16:01:51] Pigeon: /looc Drop it down, I did the wrong thing
[16:02:03] Pigeon: /adminspawnmenu
[16:02:19] James Murdoch: // abusing the shit half life 2 textures to find weapons like
[16:02:39] Lorenz Helmschmied: // this area is fucking perfect for scavenging lmao
[16:02:57] Pigeon: /it The piece of wood could potentially be used as a weapon, but it probably wouldn't last long. It was some really aged wood, and the fact it was broken doesn't gurantee its structual intregrity.
[16:03:10] James Murdoch: /y Hey, I found something!
[16:03:22] Lorenz Helmschmied: Hm, Allow me to see.
[16:03:28] James Murdoch: /Me he'd slowly stagger up the rubble careful not to trip and get fucking domed by a piece of rebar.
[16:04:00] James Murdoch: /me He'd open his hand revealing a Sharp broken piece of wood, as you inspected the wood you'd notice it was aged yet held some structrual intergrity.
[16:04:14] James Murdoch: A perfect one time use weapon.
[16:04:23] James Murdoch: Smack a CP over the head with this, grab his shit and run.
[16:04:49] James Murdoch: /looc i was looking for you pigeon overlord
[16:05:07] Lorenz Helmschmied: Hm, It is good. But we can do some upgrades to it. Such as use some of this re-bar for something of a......Shiv.
[16:05:36] Pigeon: /looc Ignore that I am vort for a second
[16:05:40] Lorenz Helmschmied: Directly using it to hit a man (Especially a Cp) would be rather.....Dangerous. We can not be to hasty when attacking
[16:05:41] Pigeon: /looc Just gonna F2 y'all
[16:05:48] Pigeon: /looc There we go
[16:06:01] Pigeon: // Able to see me in the scoreboard?
[16:06:14] Lorenz Helmschmied: We must use are brains and create affective weapons. Then mug somebody
[16:06:21] Lorenz Helmschmied: // yeah?
[16:06:29] Pigeon: // Neat. Now my desc can actually be seen.
[16:06:41] Lorenz Helmschmied: // Come to me you cuck.
[16:07:12] James Murdoch: /me He'd walk over toward Lorenz again being careful not to trip and cause his premature death.
[16:07:34] Lorenz Helmschmied: /me Slowly attempts to grab the rather mid sized pice of re-Bar near him
[16:08:14] James Murdoch: /me he'd help him pull it out putting all his might into pulling the rebar.
[16:08:25] Pigeon: // Wait, you want me to head over OOC?
[16:08:26] James Murdoch: /looc ollie are you here?
[16:08:30] Lorenz Helmschmied: // Yeah
[16:08:36] Pigeon: // Shit, my bad
[16:08:40] Pigeon: /looc Eh?
[16:08:44] Lorenz Helmschmied: // We're doing scavenging for actual items that would be used for combat.
[16:08:46] Lorenz Helmschmied: /me Slowly attempts to grab the rather mid sized pice of re-Bar near him
[16:09:05] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// this piece of re-bar in front of me
[16:09:10] James Murdoch: /me he'd step in assisting Lorenz pull the rebar putting all his might into pulling it from the base.
[16:09:13] Pigeon: /looc roll Strength since y'know, it do be under some rubble.
[16:09:20] Lorenz Helmschmied: /rollstat str
[16:09:22] James Murdoch: /rollstat str
[16:09:25] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// bet
[16:09:36] Pigeon: /it The rebar comes out pretty nicely.
[16:09:39] Pigeon: /adminspawnmenu
[16:09:59] Pigeon: /looc Let me physgun this
[16:09:59] James Murdoch: /looc Pulling aged wooden floorboards? Not a chance pulling out steel from several pounds of rubble yes easily
[16:10:06] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// Lmao
[16:10:16] Pigeon: /looc And that's why I love rolls tbh
[16:10:29] James Murdoch: /looc the pigeon works in mysterous ways
[16:10:31] Pigeon: /chargiveflag Pigeon p
[16:10:42] Pigeon: // pigeon time
[16:10:43] James Murdoch: /looc petition for the resistance to not use the lambda instead the pigeon as their logo
[16:10:52] Lorenz Helmschmied: Hm, Alright. This could be used for something. Lets go loot some Dumpsters or something for some extra items. Hopefully something like a blowtorch would be ideal.
[16:10:56] James Murdoch: This is perfect.
[16:11:02] Pigeon: // I am happy the inside of cars is physical
[16:11:06] Lorenz Helmschmied: I really don't want to make a Blowtorch with shitty parts
[16:11:17] James Murdoch: Hey!
[16:11:23] James Murdoch: You're an engineer right?
[16:11:25] Lorenz Helmschmied: This is a entrance into the sewers.
[16:11:26] Lorenz Helmschmied: Yeah
[16:11:33] James Murdoch: Surely we could scrap some of this wire.
[16:11:40] James Murdoch: Use it for something good.
[16:12:01] Lorenz Helmschmied: Hm, I think getting some rubber gloves would be ideal before touching something like that
[16:12:03] James Murdoch: He'd turn looking at the pigeon making sure not to startle it.
[16:12:11] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// You said that lmao
[16:12:19] James Murdoch: /looc for fuck sake
[16:12:22] Pigeon: /looc F
[16:12:26] James Murdoch: True.
[16:12:29] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// Lmao, you should get better at /me's
[16:12:35] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// No problem though
[16:12:41] James Murdoch: /looc my /me's are fine remebering to do the /me at the start is the issue
[16:12:49] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// Yeah, exactly
[16:12:50] James Murdoch: Alright let's go.
[16:12:54] Lorenz Helmschmied: yep!
[16:13:30] Lorenz Helmschmied: Hm.
[16:13:36] James Murdoch: Let's check out this dumpster and crate.
[16:13:41] Lorenz Helmschmied: /me Slowly begins taking out his wrench.
[16:13:48] Lorenz Helmschmied: Hey, This bird has a letter on it
[16:13:53] Pigeon: /it The Pigeon pecks at the radio for a few moments
[16:13:58] James Murdoch: Shh.
[16:14:02] James Murdoch: He'd slowly creep forward.
[16:14:06] James Murdoch: I'll grab it.
[16:14:09] Pigeon: /looc Roll agility
[16:14:10] James Murdoch: /me He'd say slowly.
[16:14:29] James Murdoch: He'd quickly leap forward attempting to put his hands around the pigeon hoping to keep it under control.
[16:14:32] James Murdoch: /rollstats agt

[16:15:18] James Murdoch: I got it!
[16:15:26] Pigeon: /it The pigeon was capture easily, it struggle a bit, but no where near as much as a normal pigeon did.
[16:15:32] James Murdoch: /me He'd say as he grabbed the pigen grabbing it by the torso.
[16:15:55] Lorenz Helmschmied: Take the letter off of it and let it go
[16:16:00] James Murdoch: /me He'd move his hands up taking the feathers with it revealing the pigons feet and the note strung to it's feet.
[16:16:04] James Murdoch: Grab the letter.
[16:16:23] Pigeon: /it The letter came off easily.
[16:16:23] Lorenz Helmschmied: /me Grabs the letter, Then pulls it directly off of the pigeons foot.
[16:16:28] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// Bet
[16:16:39] Lorenz Helmschmied: /me Begins reading the letter.
[16:16:52] James Murdoch: Read the letter first incase it involves the pigeon.

[16:19:55] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// Maybe, Maybe not
[16:19:58] James Murdoch: /looc until i grabbed it
[16:20:04] Pigeon: /it The letter read "I'm sending out to hopefully contact anyone. Rather a risk on my side, so I won't give info. Hopefully you aren't CCA, but I could give less of a shit at this point. After hearing what happened to City 08, I don't plan on returning.-

[16:20:10] Pigeon: /looc big letter
[16:21:27] Pigeon: /it - So, I might as well scout new areas. I'm tired of eating alien shit either way. And the antlions are a pain alone. I don't know if I'll make it to whereever this letter lands, but try to keep the pigeon safe, won't ya? Send the pigeon out if you act-
[16:21:47] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// This is such a long ass letter lmao
[16:21:47] James Murdoch: /looc we have just gotten ourselves into some deep shit
[16:21:58] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// And we're very much unprepared.

[16:22:35] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// Eh, we can arm ourselves pretty well if we're smart about this.
[16:22:46] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// So alot of RP engineering.
[16:22:47] Pigeon: /it -tually want to see about giving me your location. At least... the city. I can make my way. Hell, I got through the damn ocean. Just write a letter and attatch to the left leg. I'll be spending a few weeks at a undisclosed location, all you need to sa-
[16:23:16] James Murdoch: /looc if i roll a 100 while dumpster diving you are legally required to give me gordon freemans crowbar
[16:23:26] Pigeon: /it -say to have the pigeon send it, is "AEX"." The letter ends with a small signature, which you can make out as Watcher-1
[16:23:41] James Murdoch: Lucky I didn't let it go straight way isn't it?
[16:23:51] Lorenz Helmschmied: Hm, Who the fuck is Watcher-1?
[16:23:56] James Murdoch: No clue.
[16:24:03] James Murdoch: Let's take it back to our apartment quickly.
[16:24:08] Lorenz Helmschmied: Alright, Sure
[16:24:11] James Murdoch: Never knoew who might be listening.
[16:25:02] James Murdoch: /me He'd close the door and lock it.
[16:25:16] Lorenz Helmschmied: Ugh, Fuck. I guess you make the letter to send back?
[16:25:16] James Murdoch: /me He'd make sure the window is fully closed.
[16:25:32] James Murdoch: /me He'd make sure there is no cracks the pigeon could sneak through.
[16:25:41] James Murdoch: /me He'd let the pigeon go.
[16:25:52] James Murdoch: I suppose.
[16:26:05] Lorenz Helmschmied: Or should we get a actaul base in the sewers. If this guy has a name like Watcher-1 I doubt he can get into the city.
[16:26:17] Pigeon: /it The pigeon quietly just lands on the ground, before just looking around, before finding its place in the apartment. The sink.
[16:26:30] Lorenz Helmschmied: The bird is in the sink.
[16:26:32] Lorenz Helmschmied: /me chuckles
[16:26:33] James Murdoch: I'm going to go on a limb here and say that his real name isn't actually Watcher 1
[16:26:39] James Murdoch: /me He'd turn and look
[16:26:39] Lorenz Helmschmied: I'm aware.
[16:26:43] James Murdoch: /me He'd laugh as well.
[16:27:22] Lorenz Helmschmied: Ugh, I know a way into the sewers, If we can move to the sewers safely. And get a base going. That Watcher guy might be able to help us out.
[16:28:07] James Murdoch: We need to hide our weapons first.
[16:28:12] Pigeon: /it The pigeon quietly shuffled into a corner, before beginning to rest.
[16:28:19] James Murdoch: Never know when Civil Protection is going to kick down our door.
[16:28:28] James Murdoch: Or put us up against the wall and search us.
[16:28:44] Lorenz Helmschmied: Yeah. We should actually move fast instead of sitting here in the open with contraband on us
[16:29:01] James Murdoch: /me he'd turn looking at the pigeon.
[16:29:08] Lorenz Helmschmied: It would be better. If I'm not mistaken I know a spot that isn't used by anybody
[16:29:17] James Murdoch: /me he'd slowly reach out his hand stroking the pigeons back.
[16:29:33] James Murdoch: /looc gotta go in 30 minutes
[16:29:33] Pigeon: /it The pigeon cooed lightly. It wasn't new to the human touch. 
[16:29:54] Lorenz Helmschmied: Hm. The birds name is AEX. Rather odd name don't you think. Eh whatever we should get moving.
[16:30:08] James Murdoch: I was thinking we give it a slightly more normal name.
[16:30:18] James Murdoch: He'd grab the pigeon slowly making sure not to spook it.
[16:30:28] Lorenz Helmschmied: Well, We aren't its owner so it's not are place.
[16:30:36] Pigeon: /it Upon hearing the word, the bird immediatly perked up and almost began to fly, however the grab stoppped it.
[16:30:50] James Murdoch: It looks like that's it's trigger word.
[16:30:54] Lorenz Helmschmied: Alright, Seems it's rather trained
[16:30:59] James Murdoch: So let's not say that unless we are sending it on a mission.
[16:31:04] Lorenz Helmschmied: Alright
[16:31:45] James Murdoch: // i like the noise pigeons make
[16:32:07] James Murdoch: /me He'd slowly climb down making sure not to drop the pigeon or spook it
[16:32:09] Lorenz Helmschmied: Anything wrong?
[16:32:23] James Murdoch: /me He'd close the hatch behind him.
[16:32:35] Lorenz Helmschmied: Alright, Lets move

[16:33:44] James Murdoch: That sounds like screams of agony.
[16:33:46] Lorenz Helmschmied: I'll have this ready, It's not a real weapon but it can work

[23:35:19] CCA.C14-UNION.i2.98240: Hm, It seems we don't really have any "Tools" to get rid of Posters on a wall. I recommend asking for work at a later time-
