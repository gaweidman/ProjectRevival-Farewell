[16:46:46] Paul-Henri Cartier: .// LMFAO
[16:46:47] Anna Gottlieb: It's a branch of store owners and employees. Tradtionally restaurants and stores, although other businesses can be opened. A hair salon wouldn't be unwelcome, nor would a nail salon.
[16:46:56] Paul-Henri Cartier: I didn't know you were there
[16:46:57] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: If ordered to I can issue a Civil Workers Suit.
[16:47:09] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: However for now I'll wait.

[16:49:20] Jackson Steere: Some sorta' shop uniform I suppose.
[16:49:21] Paul-Henri Cartier: Trust me, don't rank up
[16:49:25] Karlos Wilsono: Essentially, a business that serves alcohol, coffee, and a few select food items. A place for true citizens to network and lounge.
[16:49:30] Paul-Henri Cartier: or at least don't accept the union washing
[16:49:34] Jackson Steere: Nothin' too fancy- just somethin' different.
[16:49:35] Simon Amanda: I don't plan to go above like i2 or when is the union washing is
[16:49:38] Anna Gottlieb: Right, sound wonderful.
[16:49:39] Paul-Henri Cartier: i3
[16:49:43] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: New attire is permitted within reason, but usually us CPs don't give much of a shit.
[16:49:44] Anna Gottlieb: Do you have a location in mind for this place?
[16:49:46] Anna Gottlieb to admins: callinit now
[16:49:48] Paul-Henri Cartier: but you can get it voluntarily at i4

[16:50:53] Robbert Garth: Darn I only took two sips
[16:50:57] Jackson Steere: Gonna be cold now
[16:50:59] Anna Gottlieb: Do you have any prior retail experience? As an employee or manager?
[16:51:02] Simon Amanda: /y Stop
[16:51:12] Halifax: .// lol
[16:51:18] Karlos Wilsono: Employee for five years and was manager for two.
[16:51:32] Anna Gottlieb: Where was this?
[16:51:33] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: /me would take out what looked to be a hot beverage bag from an old US military MRE, sealed shut with some bright green liquid in it, "You can always have a CCA drink."

[16:52:17] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: /me chuckles, sloshing the drink around before placing it back into his KIBA arms case.
[16:52:25] Paul-Henri Cartier: /me turns the lock on the door
[16:52:28] Simon Amanda: .// I forget about this place all the time
[16:52:36] Karlos Wilsono: An old shop, we dealt with re-used batteries and construction of useful tools for citizens in er... damn.. I forget. Before I transferred here.
[16:52:38] Paul-Henri Cartier: come on in
[16:52:43] Simon Amanda: damn
[16:52:44] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: CCA drinks taste like Red Bull and some off-brand Sprite combined.
[16:52:53] Karlos Wilsono: Dealt with customers that were just passing by, other times we had repeat customers both good and bad.
[16:53:00] Paul-Henri Cartier: tell no one about this
[16:53:03] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Along with vitamins, a lot of vitamins in it as well.
[16:53:04] Simon Amanda: I wont
[16:53:16] Simon Amanda: You guys got a pretty sick hideout
[16:53:17] Halifax<STEAM_0:0:207137365> changed their name to Jorge Rivens
[16:53:20] Paul-Henri Cartier: yup
[16:53:21] Robbert Garth: Kinda weird. 
[16:53:24] Client "Sigmund_Valkrich" connected.
[16:53:32] Simon Amanda: You might find these things usefull, cuz I sure hell don't
[16:53:36] Karlos Wilsono: Best to never escalate odd encounters in my experience. Workplace must be kept clean and without loitering individuals.
[16:53:40] Robbert Garth: No coffee substitute?
[16:53:45] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: I mean.....
[16:53:49] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: On paper no.
[16:53:50] Jackson Steere: Must be mixed just for the nutrience n' stuff
[16:53:52] Paul-Henri Cartier: where'd you find a flashbang
[16:54:04] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: But in practice? well that's a different story.
[16:54:06] Simon Amanda: Found it on the boat with the pistol
[16:54:07] Anna Gottlieb: Alright.
[16:54:08] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: haha
[16:54:11] Paul-Henri Cartier: niiice
[16:54:15] Jackson Steere: New fella' just walked in
[16:54:20] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: I noticed 
[16:54:23] Karlos Wilsono: I transferred here shortly after their business went down. I didnt hear much, all I heard was something about conspiracy.
[16:54:30] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: You signing up?
[16:54:39] Anna Gottlieb: Do you have any experience cooking? Would you cook, or would you have someone else working the kitchen?
[16:54:45] Simon Amanda: Also if you guys need like supply runs into the city for filters and such
[16:54:51] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: /me tapes the newcomer on the shoulder, "Yo, you, signing up?"
[16:54:55] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: /looc taps*
[16:54:58] Paul-Henri Cartier: we do, we have others, but me and King can't really go in
[16:54:59] Jorge Rivens: Huh? No, I just got here from City-8.
[16:55:04] Anna Gottlieb: .//don't tape the poor man
[16:55:13] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Right, just wondering.
[16:55:14] Simon Amanda: I know thats why I offered
[16:55:19] Jorge Rivens: Just checking out the map.
[16:55:20] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: /looc Fuck you Q 
[16:55:30] Paul-Henri Cartier: we do have a map, though
[16:55:46] Karlos Wilsono: Well before that, I would cook part-time at a deli. We made fresh sandwiches with steaks, hams, and chicken. Typical ingredients, nothing wasteful but just enough to bring flavor out.
[16:55:54] Jackson Steere: Waitin' game continues
[16:56:02] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Affirm, these things take a while.
[16:56:04] Anna Gottlieb: Steaks? At a deli? Sounds interesting.
[16:56:05] Simon Amanda: Hm
[16:56:09] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Should see CCA tryouts...
[16:56:11] Simon Amanda: I wonder if I can get into the warehouses
[16:56:11] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Christ...
[16:56:14] Simon Amanda: if there is anythin in there
[16:56:22] Paul-Henri Cartier: also, keep that gun hidden
[16:56:22] Karlos Wilsono: We would finely slice the steaks into cuts.
[16:56:29] Karlos Wilsono: Really good, actually.
[16:56:35] Paul-Henri Cartier: if they find it, it's best to go out shooting. Or shoot yourself.
[16:56:53] Anna Gottlieb: I'm struggling to be confident in a business at a large venue with only one employee. Do you have anyone in mind as a business partner?
[16:57:01] Simon Amanda: I hide it all the time before I head into the city
[16:57:10] Paul-Henri Cartier: mhm
[16:57:17] Karlos Wilsono: The short answer is no. 
[16:57:18] Paul-Henri Cartier: want me to let you out?
[16:57:31] Anna Gottlieb: hm
[16:57:45] Simon Amanda: Well yeah, I'l try to get that application thing sped up 
[16:57:47] Anna Gottlieb: Were you admitted into the Commerce Corps, would you be willing to find a business partner?
[16:57:57] Paul-Henri Cartier: you want out the long way or quick way?
[16:57:57] Simon Amanda: I'l leave my pistol here, not like I'm gona need it anytime soon
[16:57:59] Anna Gottlieb: Either someone to manage front of house or back of house?
[16:58:00] Paul-Henri Cartier: sewers or bathroom
[16:58:06] Paul-Henri Cartier: put it in a locker
[16:58:08] Simon Amanda: Bathroom
[16:58:13] Simon Amanda: /me puts the pistol on the table
[16:58:27] Karlos Wilsono: Of course. That is actually a partial reason I came here. Nobody would take me serious unless I had something to offer.
[16:58:36] Karlos Wilsono: That, and infestation.
[16:58:39] Simon Amanda: so anything needed from the shop?
[16:58:43] Paul-Henri Cartier: food

[16:58:49] Anna Gottlieb: Right.
[16:58:52] Simon Amanda: Alright I'l grab em and put it in the sink here
[16:59:01] Karlos Wilsono: I work well with others, if they would prefer front house I can manage the back, and vise versa.
[16:59:06] Anna Gottlieb: I have no problem with allowing you in the Commerce Corps, but if you want the Grotto, you need a business partner.
[17:00:01] Karlos Wilsono: I see. If by chance I am unable, what about the building closeby? It almost reaches into sector 4, but is cutoff by a secure gate.
[17:00:16] Karlos Wilsono: What I believe to be sector 4.
[17:00:16] Anna Gottlieb: The corner store with the shutter window?
[17:00:20] Karlos Wilsono: Yes.
[17:00:20] Jackson Steere: Hey Rob'.
[17:00:23] Anna Gottlieb: District four, yes.

[17:00:58] Karlos Wilsono: Downscale my idea. Perhaps just coffee and grub. I wouldn't feel comfortable with alcohol in such a small place anyways.
[17:01:08] Anna Gottlieb: Alright. I think that will be it, then.
[17:01:14] Anna Gottlieb: Welcome to the Commerce Corps. Wait in the lobby, pleas.e

[17:15:55] Anna Gottlieb: So, as an infestation control worker you would be serving over our current supervisor. He acts as the manager considering we don't have one yet, but he does a good job of keeping things together.

[17:17:34] Anna Gottlieb: And cleaning is very broaed.
[17:17:55] Anna Gottlieb: That may be transporting dead xenobes to the incinerator, it may be spraying down an infested area, it might be scraping the walls of someplace.
[17:18:19] Anna Gottlieb: Very varied, but that part is the most important part of your job. Keeping the infestations under control and from spreading.

[21:49:07] Liam Acer: No... unforunatly.
