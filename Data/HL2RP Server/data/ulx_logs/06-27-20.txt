[12:17:33] James Albright<STEAM_0:1:53097688> changed their name to George
[12:17:36] George teleported to Lorenz Helmschmied
[12:17:37] James Murdoch: We are sorrunded by zombies.
[12:17:38] James Murdoch: And crabs.
[12:17:49] James Murdoch: Crabs that really want to fucking eat you.
[12:17:52] Lorenz Helmschmied: Yeah, Thats a issue. But we can maybe clear them out
[12:17:58] James Murdoch: Do you have that rebar?
[12:17:59] Lorenz Helmschmied: With some work.....
[12:18:01] Lorenz Helmschmied: Yep
[12:18:04] James Murdoch: Pass it here.
[12:18:08] James Murdoch: Let me use it as a weapon?
[12:18:12] James Murdoch: /looc .*
[12:18:25] James Murdoch: // be on standby we will probably need you for some roles
[12:18:29] George: //alright
[12:18:33] Lorenz Helmschmied: Hm, Re-Bar as a weapon isn't a great idea. But I have a idea.
[12:18:33] James Murdoch: /ooc rolls*
[12:18:43] James Murdoch: Nothing better.
[12:19:01] James Murdoch: Hey uh Lorenz.
[12:19:06] James Murdoch: Theres another crab back here.
[12:19:13] Lorenz Helmschmied: /me takes out the rebar "Rod" and starts scraping the bottom edge onto the ground.
[12:19:15] Lorenz Helmschmied: What?
[12:19:22] James Murdoch: Look.
[12:19:28] James Murdoch: Pummel the bastard.
[12:19:29] Lorenz Helmschmied: Uh, It might be dead
[12:19:36] James Murdoch: Alright.
[12:19:40] Lorenz Helmschmied: Yeah, It's dead
[12:19:47] James Murdoch: A
[12:19:49] Lorenz Helmschmied: Let me get back to sharpening
[12:20:02] James Murdoch: // is there a rebar weapon I can actually use?
[12:20:06] Lorenz Helmschmied: /me Returns to "Sharpening" the rod of Re-Bar.
[12:20:22] George: //given how big the weapon is, I'm gonna have to say no, only becuase i remember exactly wehre that bitch came from

[12:21:14] George: /me would attempt to lunge at the citizen, but he's unable to jump fully. He just sort of lunges weakly and rolls to the side.
[12:21:26] James Murdoch: /me He'd quickly jump down off the ladder.
[12:21:32] James Murdoch: /Y OI THERES A FUCKING CRAB!
[12:21:34] Lorenz Helmschmied: // I'm sharpening a Re-Bar rod using the Ground sharpening bullshit that somehow can work

[12:22:41] George: /me is on its back, squirming pathetically.
[12:22:55] James Murdoch: /me He'd grab the headcrab pinning it down.
[12:23:01] George: /me appears to have a limp-looking leg.
[12:23:02] James Murdoch: /rollstat str
[12:23:06] Lorenz Helmschmied: Hm, Wait James
[12:23:14] Lorenz Helmschmied: It might just be scared?

[12:23:33] James Murdoch: I'm holding the bastard down.
[12:23:38] James Murdoch: Don't smash it in yet.
[12:23:43] Lorenz Helmschmied: Hm, I'm not.
[12:23:58] James Murdoch: It might be a carrier crab.
[12:24:04] James Murdoch: /me He'd chuckle at his own joke
[12:24:05] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// That moment I don't hesitate to smash a bird but hesitate to smash a Headcrab lmao

[12:24:59] George: .//tfw you found the  best weapon in the game
[12:25:02] James Murdoch: The first think we are doing is getting rid of its claws and pincers.
[12:25:02] George: .//or best item rather
[12:25:13] Lorenz Helmschmied: Hm, Want to melt them off.
[12:25:15] Lorenz Helmschmied: /me Chuckles
[12:25:25] James Murdoch: I don't know how we could do it humanley.
[12:25:31] James Murdoch: Hang on.
[12:25:44] James Murdoch: You think it can have pain killers?
[12:25:50] Lorenz Helmschmied: Maybe the wrench could be used. Same as pulling teeth.
[12:25:54] Lorenz Helmschmied: /me chuckles
[12:26:04] James Murdoch: You're laughing but that's not a half bad idea.
[12:26:16] Lorenz Helmschmied: Let me check for any items we could use.
[12:26:28] James Murdoch: // we are getting every animal possible as a fucking pet
[12:26:31] Lorenz Helmschmied: Also no idea if Painkillers can be used on a animal
[12:26:42] Lorenz Helmschmied: // Lmao, We had a bird and now maybe a crab
[12:27:09] Lorenz Helmschmied: Oh shit, This is a gold mine.
[12:27:11] James Murdoch: /me He'd keep holding the sexy little crab down.
[12:28:01] Lorenz Helmschmied: I think it should be said, My stomach feel kinda shitty. So if I die because I went into the QZ. take the blowtorch.
[12:28:08] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// feels*
[12:28:18] Lorenz Helmschmied: Alright, Now then. Lets deal with this Crab
[12:28:22] James Murdoch: You are going to die for no reason.
[12:28:33] James Murdoch: /looc you are not*
[12:28:39] Lorenz Helmschmied: The QZ is a fucked up place my friend.
[12:28:59] James Murdoch: Clearly, but we haven't breathed anything in, I don't think.
[12:29:05] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// Actually. Fuck I died to a crab the second I spawned so I don't really know what we're gonna do about it.
[12:29:23] James Murdoch: Right, what are we going to do with this fucking crab?
[12:29:38] Lorenz Helmschmied: No clue. It seems kinda tame compared to other Crabs.
[12:29:47] James Murdoch: I suppose.
[12:29:53] James Murdoch: It's probably that broken leg really.
[12:30:07] George: /me is still very much squirming.
[12:30:15] George: /me can't muster up the strength to get out, thoguh.
[12:30:20] Lorenz Helmschmied: Yeah, We might have to cut it off and seal the wound using the blowtorch
[12:30:32] Lorenz Helmschmied: but do we have any Cutting tools?
[12:30:39] James Murdoch: I saw a hammer on the floor.
[12:30:49] James Murdoch: What else did you pick up?
[12:31:27] Lorenz Helmschmied: I have it, But smashing it's leg is kinda redundant. I picked up some chocalite and a box of screws. Let me check everything else.
[12:31:34] James Murdoch: I'm pretty sure the way these things couple with your head is that they dig their little pincers into your skull then they take control.
[12:31:41] Lorenz Helmschmied: I have some battered scrap now.
[12:31:48] James Murdoch: So if we cut off the pincers it will be harmless.
[12:32:07] James Murdoch: Or if we make the pincers blunt.
[12:32:31] Lorenz Helmschmied: Hm, Blunting them will still make it aggresive. Taking the pincers off would be a better idea.
[12:32:36] James Murdoch: Yeah.#
[12:32:38] James Murdoch: But how?
[12:32:45] Lorenz Helmschmied: /me Takes out his Wrench.
[12:32:56] George: //tfw my metropolice sound pack didn't download properly and i can't listen to the sounds
[12:33:06] James Murdoch: // the overwatch voice sounds?
[12:33:06] Lorenz Helmschmied: I have a idea. But it might not feel very good for the Crab

[12:33:19] James Murdoch: Alright.
[12:33:22] James Murdoch: I'll hold it still.

[12:33:41] James Murdoch: /me TIGHTLY GRASPS THE HEADCRAB WITH BOTH HANDS
[12:33:43] James Murdoch: /looc caps*
[12:33:58] Lorenz Helmschmied: /me Puts it over the First fang of the Crab and tightens the wrench up.
[12:34:12] James Murdoch: If it bleeds we cauterize the wound with a blowtorch.
[12:34:23] James Murdoch: /looc did you place these items here or are they randomly spawned?
[12:34:42] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// This was the stash for Pain.
[12:34:51] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// I think?
[12:35:00] George: /me squints as the wrench is tightened.
[12:35:08] George: /me 's head cavity tightens slightly.
[12:35:33] James Murdoch: /looc i keep almost saying headcrab 
[12:35:37] Lorenz Helmschmied: Hm, I think this might not be the best idea. What do you think these fangs are attached to?
[12:35:54] James Murdoch: I think it's just clenching up.
[12:35:54] Lorenz Helmschmied: .// I feel like I'm gonna kill you lmao
[12:36:02] James Murdoch: If somebody was pulling our teeth out we would clench up.

[12:37:56] James Murdoch: It doesn't seem to be bleeding.
[12:38:01] James Murdoch: Strange.
[12:38:08] Lorenz Helmschmied: Just a bit of blood?

[12:39:25] Lorenz Helmschmied: /me Holds out the Blowtorch to the man.
