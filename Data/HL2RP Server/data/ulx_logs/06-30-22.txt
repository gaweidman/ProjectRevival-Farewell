[14:21:54] CCA.C17-RCT.07722: /ooc afk
[14:22:02] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: Commanders lead a city, specifically the military and defense aspects, and Sectorials lead a sector. This means they have some say over the city and all the say over the outlands in that region.

[14:23:13] Ethan King: /looc Fuck you 
[14:23:15] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: Quartermasters are their own rank, although rank is a bit of a misnomer.
[14:24:07] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: They don't have much jurisdiction over regular units, and stick to themselves. In an emergency, they may give orders to anyone ranked i1 or below.
[14:24:21] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: They only leave the nexus to look around, and do not patrol.
[14:24:52] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: They also keep the guns working and clean, and maintain other weapon stocks.
[14:25:24] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: Any rank can become a quartermaster, but only a divisional or higher can transfer someone into the position of quartermaster.
[14:25:28] Emily Brown: // im gonna go afk for a bit, if you wouldnt mind q, can you permaprop my store when you're done with whatever you need to do next after training?
[14:25:30] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: Quartermasters report in to the Sector quartermaster.

[14:25:51] Emily Brown: // you too
[14:26:00] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: The sector quartermaster keeps an eye on larger stocks and quartermasters within a sector, they're not seen much.
[14:26:12] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: Quartermasters also manage quality of life and less important stocks.

[14:28:13] Robbert Garth: /charfallover 0.1
[14:28:27] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: They have to do with how the citizens in the city are acting.
[14:28:36] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: The more anti-civil activity, the higher the sociostatus.
[14:28:45] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: Green is regular procedure. Some anti-civil activity, but it's manageable.

[14:29:27] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.29852: shoo
[14:29:34] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: Red means the situation is out of control, and is normally seen in tandem with OTA and conscripts out in the streets patrolling. Martial law, if you will.

[14:30:30] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: Once sociostatus black is hit, citizens are removed from the city and deported, and that city is now dead, if you will.
[14:30:45] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.29852: civil judgement
[14:30:46] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: Sociostatus doesn't have to do with anything else, it only has to do with anti-civil activity.
[14:31:00] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: If Xenobes, that is, aliens, are roaming the street, sociostatus would still be green.
