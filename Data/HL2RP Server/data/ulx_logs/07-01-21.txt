[19:52:14] Freidrich Krueger: Nope? Ight, The floor it is then, or my suit.
[19:52:22] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Right.
[19:52:23] Freidrich Krueger: Good to know, I can hold it in for a bit.
[19:52:28] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Anyways, there are two options.
[19:52:48] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: You can either refine metal or refine electronics.
[19:53:05] Freidrich Krueger: Whatever involves less heavy lifting, I dont want to shit out my bowels.
[19:53:10] Freidrich Krueger: Electronics.
[19:53:26] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Refining electronics is fairly simple. Look through piles of electronic scrap, and pick out the parts that aren't broken.
[19:53:36] Freidrich Krueger: Nice, I can do that.
[19:54:03] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Refining metal is a little more difficult, but it pays more.
[19:54:13] Freidrich Krueger: Ah, Fuck it metal it is.
[19:54:13] Freidrich Krueger: /y HOOAH!
[19:54:18] Freidrich Krueger: /LOOC void
[19:54:24] Freidrich Krueger: /looc Old bind apologies
[19:54:33] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: You melt down some charred metal, take out the parts that are better quality, melt them down, repeat several times until you've got decently refined metal.
[19:54:37] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: .// No problem
[19:54:48] Freidrich Krueger: Ah fuck it electronics then.
[19:55:10] Freidrich Krueger: This guy next to me is quite.. quiet. You know what they say about silent people.
[19:55:16] Freidrich Krueger: The ones who speak less shit louder.
[19:55:34] Erwin Ramstein: /me *he'd sigh*
[19:55:40] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: So, refining metal pays more but takes more time. Refining electronics pays less but takes less time.
[19:55:47] Freidrich Krueger: Electronics.
[19:55:49] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//Also, electronics makes your engineering higher

[19:56:39] Erwin Ramstein: Alrighty.
[19:56:49] Freidrich Krueger: ight.
[19:56:55] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: You need blacksmith tongs, on the other table, for your metalworking.
