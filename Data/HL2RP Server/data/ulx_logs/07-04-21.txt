[13:56:30] Ethan King: Right after we got the city back.
[13:56:35] Ethan King: Frankly embarrassing.
[13:56:47] (tsay from The Consul) Yeah, it doesn't quite beat my old job. I could come to my family, it was nice. But the CWU is fine.

[13:58:05] (tsay from The Consul) No, the Combine killed them. I didn't find out, though, because they split us up into different precincts.
[13:58:15] Ethan King: Hm.....come with me.
[13:58:31] The Consul: /event The Minister clears her throat and makes a strained, stern look with her eyes, while her face holds up a very plastered smile.

[13:58:49] Ethan King: You want to talk like that? lets see if you can back up that statement.
[13:58:51] The Consul: /event It's almost like she's staring lasers into Matthew. Figuratively.
[13:58:58] Ethan King: Come on
[13:59:09] (tsay from The Consul) I mean come on. Let's be honest. They did. You can't deny that.
[13:59:27] (tsay from The Consul) Well, it's for the cost of safety, and liberty!
[13:59:32] Ethan King: Well then, howdy.
[13:59:49] (tsay from The Consul) Yeah, the liberty is fun. Nothing says I'm free like not being able to own power tools.
[14:00:03] Ethan King: // Spitting straight facts though

[14:00:40] Ethan King: Well then
[14:00:49] Mal Tresto: hi
[14:00:53] Ethan King: Whatever
[14:01:10] Ethan King: So, you stated you want to kill one of them?
[14:01:11] Mal Tresto: cheese
[14:01:15] John Donovan: Yeah.
[14:01:18] Ethan King: Do you still stand by that?
[14:01:19] Mal Tresto: dream about cheese
[14:01:27] John Donovan: Absolutely.
[14:01:27] The Consul: /event The camera cuts to a different view, pointing toward the rest of the production crew. It's pointed to the right of Matthew, only enough to see him sitting up in the chair. You see a shadow from his left approach him. You can't see who it is.
[14:01:37] John Donovan: Even if my life's n' danger
[14:01:39] Mal Tresto: dream about cheese
[14:01:43] Ethan King: Noted
[14:01:58] Ethan King: Well then, we should go somewhere a little more private.
[14:02:08] Mal Tresto<STEAM_0:1:191784883> changed their name to Crow
[14:02:30] Ethan King: Now then
[14:02:33] Ethan King: Oh, ignore him.
[14:02:37] The Consul: /event The sound of 3.5mm audio jacks having their cords ripped out is played through the citywide screens' speakers. Seems like they're cutting the sound.
[14:02:37] Crow<STEAM_0:1:191784883> changed their name to Mal Tresto
[14:02:41] Ethan King: .// It do be a vendor though.
[14:02:50] John Donovan: [[y
[14:02:52] Mal Tresto: // cant they just turn off the fucking broadcast
[14:03:06] The Consul: //broadcast ain't over guy
[14:03:20] Ethan King: I happen to be apart of a group that would love to take in people with your......goals.
[14:03:24] The Consul: /broadcast Put on the technical difficulties. Are they on?
[14:03:25] Mal Tresto: dream about cheese
[14:03:42] John Donovan: Mmh..
[14:03:43] The Consul: /event You hear no response, but the consul continues speaking.
[14:03:57] The Consul: /broadcast Good. Production, dismissed.
[14:03:59] Ethan King: At the moment I won't give away any specific details but we would love to take you in and supply you with gear and weapons if you can prove yourself.
[14:04:10] John Donovan: How can i prove myself?
[14:04:22] The Consul: /event Through his microphone you hear footsteps quickly leaving the room.
[14:04:29] Ethan King: Hello, there.
[14:04:45] Ethan King: Do you mind? we are all in an illegal area but we might as well keep our privacy.
[14:04:50] Mal Tresto: dream about cheese
[14:04:54] Ethan King: Duly noted
[14:05:07] The Consul: /broadcast I knew this was unwise. We should have brought on a higher-ranked loyalist. This... common man approach was idiotic.
[14:05:17] The Consul: //shut up consul, the consul is speaking
[14:05:28] Ethan King: Now then
[14:05:33] Ethan King: Alright
[14:05:49] Ethan King: Please stop
[14:06:10] The Consul: /event You see a strange-looking OTA drag Matthew out of his chair.
[14:06:22] Ethan King: Alright, all you need to do is eliminate a single CCA officer.
[14:06:25] The Consul: /event He's further to the right now, thrown onto the floor.
[14:06:31] Ethan King: Bring me his mask and i'll believe you.
[14:06:42] John Donovan: Sure
[14:06:43] Ethan King: You may use outside help as well.
[14:06:54] John Donovan: Do i need a gun for this?
[14:07:01] Ethan King: You can use whatever you find.
[14:07:10] Ethan King: Don't think you'll accomplish this in a single day.
[14:07:24] Ethan King: I want you to make a plan and use others to your advantage.
[14:07:33] Ethan King: That is what we do, and that is what you need to do.
[14:07:44] John Donovan: Noted
[14:07:51] The Consul: /broadcast Citizen, you are under violation of penal code 647e. You are judged guilty.
[14:07:55] Ethan King: Stomping on others is required for something like this.
[14:08:14] John Donovan: You gotta break some skulls to make meat.
[14:08:20] Ethan King: Yep, yep.
[14:08:35] Ethan King: I have a good feeling about you.
[14:08:39] Ethan King: Don't prove me wrong.
[14:08:53] The Consul: /event Tears go down the man's face. From reading his clips, you can guess he's saying "No" and "Sorry".
[14:08:55] John Donovan: Listen, i'll get to fuckin work, bloodshed or not.
[14:09:01] John Donovan: I already know what to do
[14:09:05] The Consul: //thank you for leaving out the period /event very cool
[14:09:06] Ethan King: Alright, then I hope to welcome you into the Legion.
[14:09:17] Ethan King: You may go now.
[14:09:21] Ethan King: Take your time.
[14:09:21] The Consul to admins: ethan i swear to sweet mother of fuck

[14:09:48] The Consul returned Themself to their original position
[14:09:55] Ethan King to admins: Is it stupid? yes, is it effective for making a large group? also yes.
[14:10:03] Ethan King: Need anything?
[14:10:15] Mal Tresto: .// enjoy
[14:10:25] The Consul: /event The OTA units from before grab him by his legs and drag him to the left. He's no longer on the screen. A minute later, a single gunshot is heard through the Consul's microphone.

[14:11:52] Mal Tresto: the lad you we're talking with
[14:11:58] Ethan King: Ah, probably.
[14:12:00] The Consul: /broadcast Now is not the time to play games and jokes, Smith.
[14:12:02] Mal Tresto: let's check
[14:12:15] The Consul: /broadcast Take off the technical difficulties screen and let me address the City.
[14:12:15] Ethan King: Eh, i've gotta get out of here.
[14:12:22] Ethan King: The city is too dangerous to stay in casually.
[14:12:30] Ethan King: Recruiting is the only reason to stay there.
[14:12:31] Mal Tresto: .// what do i do if i find a can of soda with infinite drink

[15:40:26] Mal Tresto: .// i just realized i have 0 mins left
[15:40:28] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: -you find, and through ration cycles. CWU members also earn tokens, and you can get tokens other ways through citizens, just by doing favors or whatever needs done.
[15:40:37] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: //you wat
[15:40:46] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Resin are these little pucks of shiny blueish metal.

[17:00:00] Mal Tresto: .// bc ik all im gonna do is sit here and fucking have to listen to your shitty virtual speech
[17:00:09] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i2.61020: As you know you have 4 major violations and 2 minor violations. 
[17:00:31] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i2.61020: Most prosecutions will ignore lower violations if there are much higher ones on the table, so consider it 4 major violations.
[17:00:43] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i2.61020: If you had hit the camera once, you would have been able to possibly get away with this.
[17:01:09] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i2.61020: Going back after running and hitting it two more times doesn't help your case.

[17:02:27] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i2.61020: You're going to be put on trial to discuss whether or not you deserve to live and whether or not you'll reoffend.
[17:02:31] Mal Tresto: .// spaghetti sauce, mostly meat
[17:02:36] Mal Tresto: .// with herbs 
[17:02:39] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i2.61020: Chance to reoffend affects the case greatly. You defend yourself, no lawyer.

[17:03:04] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i2.61020: Trials are held in this room or in the solitary confinement cell, and are not your typical pre-war trial.

[17:05:23] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i2.61020: Contest means you  want to defend yourself, no contest means you take the charges like a man and don't defend yourself. You take what the trial gives you.
[17:05:32] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i2.61020: Which is it?
[17:05:58] Mal Tresto: no contest
