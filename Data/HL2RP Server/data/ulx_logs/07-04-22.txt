[20:56:20] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.07722: affirmative, stack, prep, lock, inject...
[20:56:47] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Yes yes- those are the words.
[20:57:00] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: I would recommend just sticking to answering the questions
[20:57:08] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: How about basic data entry?
[20:57:20] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Loyalty status, and Infactions?
[20:58:12] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.07722: A decent bit, but I had learned more from other units.
[20:58:18] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: I see.
[20:58:35] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: What else did they show you- or go into detail about? I want to know if you have any gaps in your training.
[20:59:22] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.07722: i was taught about basic gun rules, reeducation... The ranks. Rollout...
[20:59:36] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.07722: Breaching.
[20:59:49] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.07722: the different divisions.
[21:00:01] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: All the way through the guidebooks however- I'm not certain you've had much *practical* training, yes?
[21:00:55] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.07722: Affirmative, we went through the guidebook, but for training, we used a magazine of 9mm, and breached doors twice and that was about it...
[21:01:34] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.07722: so not a lot of training, only going through the handbook.
[21:01:42] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Understood. Come with me for a moment. I want to go through a certain... *exercise* .
[21:02:15] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.07722: /me shivers, thinking of what could be planned for him.

[21:03:28] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: So I'm going to toughen you up so you're on par with the other ground units
[21:04:02] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.07722: never been here before...
[21:04:09] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Take this more as a quiz of sorts.
[21:04:16] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Well both quiz and practical.
[21:04:36] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Regardless of the result. Even if you do poorly
[21:04:43] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Nothing bad will happen.
[21:04:55] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: What you're getting out of this is a learning experience you can remember for your days on
[21:05:07] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: And you might not even learn anything
[21:05:08] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: However.
[21:05:22] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: This way
[21:05:34] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Alright. Now let me paint the picture
[21:05:39] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: One moment
[21:05:45] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: /me he raises his PDA and begins typing down something
[21:06:25] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Evidently this individual is in possession of contraband.
[21:06:30] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: His attire specifically.
[21:06:36] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: We will treat it as such
[21:07:21] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Now. Setting the scene- you are on a patrol and this individual begins threatning you, armed with a knife, and begins to attack you.
[21:08:15] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: In this scenario you are on a small patrol alone in an ally.
[21:08:51] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Having encounterd this individual what will you do
[21:08:56] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: .// ?*
[21:10:49] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.07722: Once the indivisual attacks me, he would be charged with 243; Assaulting a officer. I would then have to take out my firearm and administer his verdicts, whilst at the same time, calling for backup, via the radio.
[21:11:19] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Great.
[21:12:07] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Now you've raised you 9mm and you've fired some shots on the individual; non-leathal shots. You have them on the ground facing down.
[21:12:31] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: And you've called for additional assistance via radio. Great
[21:12:38] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Remember communication is key
[21:13:01] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Informing all units of your current location and the location at which you are going to be is important.
[21:13:23] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: If anything were to go wrong. Back up would be seconds away
[21:13:48] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: I want to touch into detail. Let's add up the counts of infractions on this individual.
[21:14:05] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Once you've had them on the ground, what do you do? 
[21:14:31] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Few minutes until backup arrives by this point
[21:14:37] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: One or two I'd say
[21:16:20] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.07722: once the suspect is on the ground, you would want to first, get the knife away from the suspect, and detain him, whilst being on high alert for any more threats that could appear. You would also want to report on the radio that you were attacked with a knife and have wounds.
[21:17:11] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Great. Now let's focus on the detained perspective. Let's say backup arrives and has secured the area.
[21:17:52] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Having the person on the ground, what do you do to them specifically- I like how you mentioned that you remove the weapon... but anything else? 
[21:18:17] Client "nasirgibson39" connected.
[21:19:11] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.07722: you would then want to search the suspect. Incase he had another weapon which he could use to harm you or another unit.
[21:19:36] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Awsome. Now I'll add on.
[21:21:10] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: You would want to search them- however once apprehending the threat you should always always restrain the individual. I figure you already know this since you mentioned to search. Now in doing this and in having the area secured you should administer the proper infractions on the individual's data.
[21:22:06] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: It is very important we keep details on citizen's data. Infractions specifically since they add up.
[21:22:26] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Even the simple misdemeanor violations add up.
[21:23:03] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: However- if the individual is unconcious it's a different story.
[21:23:59] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: But always remember prior to administering any verdict- write down in the individual's data... Of course we always have exceptions.
[21:24:19] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.07722: Due to the citizen being charged with 243, he would be amputated. But he has additional violations such as, 95, and 415.
[21:25:15] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Amputation should be delt with within the walls of the nexus when able.

[21:27:56] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Another thing to add if you can when administering a verdict; always take the individual suspect into a discreet location.
[21:28:02] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Just a good habit to have
