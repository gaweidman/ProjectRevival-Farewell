[23:44:54] Paweł Kalinowski: Did you hear of the great fire of city 8, Well the fire got soo bad that people couldn't control it. So we were evacted to a small town, I got a dog blue looking thing stuck in my hand. After the Officer took it off he told me to keep the fire extinguishe-

[23:53:19] CCA.C14-UNION.i2.98240: /actstand
[23:53:59] CCA.C14-JUDGE.i1.91412: not a large concern. Keep it in your fridge, or for all i care get a locker or some shit to keep it in
[23:54:24] CCA.C14-JUDGE.i1.91412: you don't need 3 bottles of Gin on you. It's slightly suspicious paired with some items
[23:54:36] Paweł Kalinowski: It's a big concern for me considering there is no shop that sells it.

[23:58:48] Paweł Kalinowski: Back in city 8 there was some kind of strange event, and I got teleported to the forest, I found it in a car. Later a hammer unit found me and arrested me and I was later brought back to the main city.
