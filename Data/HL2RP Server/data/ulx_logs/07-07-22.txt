[00:38:23] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: /rooc that's a good one too. i feel like in a regime like this it's best to purposefully understate the strength of the "enemy"
[00:38:30] Alex Palovichov: A screw driver?
[00:38:41] Denford F. MacMillian: Name everything you need and I'll hand it to you.

[00:40:59] Alex Palovichov: Top right one
[00:41:16] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: /me holds the screwdriver on the wall
[00:41:24] Alex Palovichov: /me Readies his crowbar, hitting it hard once
[00:41:32] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.29852: denford
[00:41:32] Denford F. MacMillian: /looc Guessing nothing?
[00:41:33] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: /me removes it from thr wall
[00:41:35] Denford F. MacMillian: Yes sir?

[00:41:41] Alex Palovichov: Final one!
[00:41:42] Denford F. MacMillian: Well you see.
[00:41:48] Denford F. MacMillian: My question is to you.
[00:41:49] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: /me puts its on the wall

[00:42:06] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: /me removes the screw driver
[00:42:10] Alex Palovichov: Wonderful!
[00:42:15] Alex Palovichov: EY!
[00:42:15] Denford F. MacMillian: How would I be able to help them if there's only one drill and two individuals on the work, it's best to do side work and make sure everything's ready before we place it.
[00:42:18] Alex Palovichov: DO YOUR JOB!
[00:42:20] Denford F. MacMillian: My question to you is.
[00:42:27] Denford F. MacMillian: /me slowly turns to Alex.
[00:42:29] Alex Palovichov: We don't have ALL DAY!
[00:42:36] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: Hes right you know
[00:42:40] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: /me would stay quiet, waiting to see what the UNION unit does and says.

[00:42:49] Denford F. MacMillian: Alex.
[00:42:51] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.29852: work together, not against eachother.
[00:42:59] Alex Palovichov: Sorry, thats just how supervisors speak...
[00:43:01] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.29852: being counter productive here is being counter productive to the Union
[00:43:04] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.29852: you don't want that, do you?
[00:43:08] Alex Palovichov: Never!
[00:43:10] Denford F. MacMillian: I'm checking if the cabinet's in good condition, if you want me on something else then tell me.
[00:43:16] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.29852: so, figure it out together.
[00:43:20] Denford F. MacMillian: I don't want to hinder any progress you two are doing.
[00:43:21] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: I would never do anything to hard our objective
[00:43:28] Alex Palovichov: We're simply waiting for you to install the cabinet...
[00:43:32] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: .// harm*
[00:43:33] Denford F. MacMillian: Oh, it's done?
[00:43:35] Denford F. MacMillian: Fantastic.
[00:43:37] Alex Palovichov: Yes...
[00:43:42] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: /me fixes his mask's eyes on the UNION unit.
[00:44:00] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: .// /me makes mad face through mask
[00:44:00] Alex Palovichov: lets move outta the way
[00:44:10] Denford F. MacMillian: /me grabs the cabinet from the table and walks over to the hole in the wall, the man sighed softly as he realised he didn't do a good job in keeping tab on the work. He placed it into the hole, then did the same with the cabinet face.
[00:44:22] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: /rooc alright getting food for real
[00:44:24] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: Can I breath in here?
[00:44:25] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: /rooc well done there

[00:44:59] Denford F. MacMillian: Don't test it.
[00:45:00] Alex Palovichov: Not my apartment...
[00:45:01] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.29852: cut the chatter, get it installed
[00:45:11] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: .// I dont like your mouth chief
[00:45:12] Alex Palovichov: We're waiting for him to install it!
[00:45:19] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: .//hes' doing good

[00:45:26] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: .//and denford
[00:45:29] Denford F. MacMillian: /me sighed softly as he continued getting the cabinet installed, he checked the measurements and decided it was good enough. He would sucessfully install it into the wall and stepped back.
[00:45:30] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: .//but he's wsriitng out a long /me i think
[00:45:30] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: .// I know everyone is

[00:45:47] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: Try to shake it. Does it move?
[00:45:59] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: /me starts messing with his hair clearly bored
[00:46:01] Denford F. MacMillian: /me walks over to the cabinet and shakes it softly, it doesn't appear to move.
[00:46:13] Alex Palovichov: Wonderful! 
[00:46:19] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: Now get the faceplate on and we can consider this done.
[00:46:27] Denford F. MacMillian: Copy that.
[00:46:30] Denford F. MacMillian: Alex, mind handing it over?
[00:46:32] Alex Palovichov: /me Reaches into the box and hands over the faceplate

[00:47:08] Denford F. MacMillian: /me takes the face-plate and nods to him, giving a thank you before facing back to the cabinet...He would adjust the face-plate and do some more measurements, then applied the face-plate onto the cabinet.
[00:47:10] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.29852: matt
[00:47:19] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.29852: you look real bored

[00:55:22] Denford F. MacMillian: /me grabs onto the cabinet with his hands at the bottom, he lifts it up with his legs before moving towards the wall and looking at it. He would attempt to see if it fit...
[00:55:44] Denford F. MacMillian: /looc Should I A. Roll and hope it fits, B. Say it doesn't and give them more work, or C. Say it fists.

[00:57:20] Alex Palovichov: I'd love to be an engineer if its THAT easy
[00:58:12] Denford F. MacMillian: /me walks over to the hole again and attempts to fit the cabinet inside, and this time it worked perfectly. The man did a few more things to assure it works, shaking it to see if it was too lose, which it wasn't and checking if it's stable. It was, and so he turned back and grabbed the cabinet face, he would then do the same as before, applying the face onto the cabinet and wall, stepping back once he's done.
[00:58:15] Denford F. MacMillian: There we go.
[00:58:48] Alex Palovichov: Wonderful!

[01:01:18] Alex Palovichov: Ah
[01:01:30] Alex Palovichov: Brick...
[01:01:40] Alex Palovichov: you could actually just drill right through it!
[01:01:45] Alex Palovichov: No fuss
[01:01:48] Denford F. MacMillian: Fa-
[01:01:56] Denford F. MacMillian: /me looks over to the camera slowly...
[01:01:58] Alex Palovichov: Just don't over heat the drill
[01:02:11] Alex Palovichov: Drill a bit, stop, Drill a bit stop...
[01:02:12] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: Yeah I did this when I moved into my apartment in college
[01:02:14] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: /me would take out his PDA.
[01:02:15] Denford F. MacMillian: /looc Dneford's about to be charged with Camera murder.
[01:02:16] Alex Palovichov: Sure
[01:02:19] Denford F. MacMillian: /looc *Denford.
[01:02:23] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: Im good to go>
[01:02:25] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: ?
[01:02:25] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: /me would hit a few buttons on his PDA, and the camera would turn off.
[01:02:31] Alex Palovichov: Yep
[01:02:40] Alex Palovichov: just don't overheat the drill
[01:02:41] Client "SAMURAI" connected.
[01:02:52] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: /me would drill into the wall stopping for a couple seconds then going again
[01:03:06] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: /me repeats the process for the next couple holes
[01:03:10] Denford F. MacMillian: /me opens the box once more, hoping it will be the final time for this day, as he grabbed out the cabinet and the cabinet face, he would place them onto the other crate and began his inspections...He over-heard what Alex said, and spouted out a suggestion - "After drilling a hole, give it tiem to cool off."
[01:03:30] Alex Palovichov: Sure...What...uhh
[01:03:36] Alex Palovichov: Denford! Said
[01:03:39] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: /me would talk while drilling "I did this in my college dorm whole brick wall."
[01:03:44] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: in my room
[01:03:48] Denford F. MacMillian: Give it like Fiften to Thirty seconds.
[01:03:49] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: /me finishes drilling
[01:03:52] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: Alrightr
[01:03:53] Denford F. MacMillian: /looc *Fifteen.
[01:04:05] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: I finished
[01:04:10] Alex Palovichov: Alrighty!
[01:04:25] Denford F. MacMillian: /me continued to inspect the cabinet and hoped to find nothing wrong if it, the man would then do the same for the cabinet face, remaining a little slow but also effective in his work and job.
[01:04:30] Denford F. MacMillian: Is it ready?
[01:04:36] Alex Palovichov: Yep!
[01:04:39] Denford F. MacMillian: Alright.
[01:04:44] Denford F. MacMillian: Let me do these final checks and we'll be good.
[01:04:45] Denford F. MacMillian: Actually.
[01:05:03] Denford F. MacMillian: /me walks over to the other crate and pulls out measuring tape, he would use it to measure the cabinet, then walks over to the hole and did the same...
[01:05:05] Denford F. MacMillian: /roll
[01:05:13] Denford F. MacMillian: Hmm...
[01:05:24] Denford F. MacMillian: Drill a little bit more on the bottom.
[01:05:36] Alex Palovichov: Which...Alright
[01:05:41] Alex Palovichov: /me Grabs the drill
[01:05:41] Denford F. MacMillian: Both sides.
[01:05:53] Alex Palovichov: /me Begins to drill further into the wall on both sides
[01:06:04] Denford F. MacMillian: /me grabbed onto the cabient with both of his hands and just awaited for Alex to finish with what he's doing.
[01:06:12] Alex Palovichov: /me Reaches into his pocket taking out a water bottle and splashes the water on the drill to prevent overheating
[01:06:29] Alex Palovichov: There!
[01:06:32] Alex Palovichov: Done
[01:06:34] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: // god the cps look like a angry dad and his small kid
[01:06:40] Denford F. MacMillian: /looc WHY DID YOU SAY THAT!
[01:06:46] Denford F. MacMillian: /LOOC NOW I'M GONNA NOT UN-SEE THAT!
[01:06:51] Denford F. MacMillian: /looc you monster!
[01:06:56] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: /rooc my legs hurt very badly
[01:06:57] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: .// family bonding
[01:07:46] Denford F. MacMillian: /me whistles the Australian anthem as he slides the cabinet into the wall, and then did the same process he did twice before with the final checks. He checked the strength of the wall then the cabinet, making sure it never shakes, etc. After that, he would go back to the box and grabbed the cabinet face, he knew it was in good shape due to inspecting it earlier, and so he would apply it onto the cabinet slowly but again, effectively.
[01:08:15] Denford F. MacMillian: Done.
[01:08:19] Alex Palovichov: Wonderful!
[01:08:21] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.29852: right
[01:08:26] Denford F. MacMillian: That the last one?
[01:08:31] Alex Palovichov: Should be
[01:09:06] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.29852: affirmative
[01:09:17] Denford F. MacMillian: Guessing we return these?
[01:09:24] Alex Palovichov: Matt grab a box
[01:09:27] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: Sure
[01:09:42] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.29852: get them set up near the exit
[01:09:59] Alex Palovichov: It seems stuck!
[01:10:01] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: // HOOOOOO

[01:10:59] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: no

[01:11:24] Matthew 'Matt' Miller: Meh
[01:11:30] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: /me would not respond to denford.
[01:11:36] Denford F. MacMillian: /me felt rejected.
[01:11:38] CCA.C08-GRID.EpU.06912: Leave the crates in this fenced in area here.

[01:21:52] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //becuase the guide doesn't say they do
[01:21:54] Denford F. MacMillian: // But what if I said...Ye-
[01:22:11] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /w Exactly. It's a much better way of ensuring sociostability than just plain beatings.
[01:22:12] Alex Palovichov: /ooc Also Q you sure there is priority rations? cause I was told when I was getting my ration they didn't have em?
[01:22:21] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //they might not be in the machine, i[ll check
[01:22:24] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.29852: /w I see. That makes much more sense.
[01:22:40] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /w Beatings still work, but just beating them won't do the entire job of keeping them engaged with what we're trying to do.
[01:23:13] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /w You have to break how they think and feel.
[01:23:18] Denford F. MacMillian: // Is it possible to do community work after a work shift or is there a cool-down.
[01:23:21] Matthew 'Matt' Miller<STEAM_0:0:143523274> changed their name to Tim Hardmen
[01:23:31] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //you mean like a work desk job
[01:23:32] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.29852: /w ...I see. I'll keep it in mind for my future.
[01:23:34] Tim Hardmen: // Id like this to be my cwu char
[01:23:49] Denford F. MacMillian: // Yeah, sorry if I don't use the right wording.
[01:23:59] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /w Just like BASIC training in the military or standard training in the CCA. You have to break old habits of thought and feelings.
[01:24:05] Denford F. MacMillian: // Not too familiar with that, haven't played proper HL2RP in a *long* time.
[01:24:07] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //you're good. yes, you can. there's no cooldown
[01:24:14] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //welcome, then
[01:24:20] Denford F. MacMillian: // Thanks gamer.

[01:24:35] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.29852: /w That makes sense.
[01:24:38] Tim Hardmen: // I will say PR is a keeper server
[01:24:42] Denford F. MacMillian: // It is.
[01:24:50] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /w Alright, we've been here a bit long. Get patrolling. I have other things to do.
[01:24:54] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /w Actually..
[01:24:54] Tim Hardmen: // Alr so what do I have to do now
[01:24:55] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.29852: /w Copy.
[01:25:05] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //wait for one of us to process you. chief will redeem that for you after he processes you
[01:25:15] Tim Hardmen: // alright

[01:26:21] Tim Hardmen: // Commerce corps
[01:26:27] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //logistics core isn't open right now because we don't have enough CWU members to need people in it
[01:26:29] Denford F. MacMillian: Does a pipe count as contraband?
[01:26:31] Denford F. MacMillian: Because.
[01:26:32] Tim Hardmen: // I wanna own a resteraunt
[01:26:33] Denford F. MacMillian: In a sense.
[01:26:38] Denford F. MacMillian: You can beat the ever loving shit out of someone.

[01:26:53] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.29852: it's literally just a pipe
[01:26:58] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: You could beat someone with your fists too. Are hands illegal?
[01:27:09] Denford F. MacMillian: My hands are legally considered weapons, officer.
[01:27:13] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.29852: beat it
[01:27:25] Denford F. MacMillian: Understood, officers, have a good one!
[01:27:25] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /me would unclip his stunstick and flick it on.

[01:27:29] Denford F. MacMillian: Oh.

[01:27:38] Denford F. MacMillian: Apologies, sir.
[01:27:39] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Wall.
[01:27:42] Denford F. MacMillian: God damn it.
[01:27:42] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912 set the hp for Denford F. MacMillian to 20
[01:27:52] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The extra comments aren't helping.
[01:27:58] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /me would confirm his stunstick is on low voltage.
[01:28:08] Denford F. MacMillian: Apologies, officer.
[01:28:09] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Union, cover my left side.
[01:28:12] Denford F. MacMillian: It appears I have a big mouth.

[01:28:30] Denford F. MacMillian: /me nods.
[01:28:44] Denford F. MacMillian: /looc would you blame me if I said I found this funny?
[01:28:46] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /me would move his arm out to be in line with the rest of his chest, about a half of his arm's span.
[01:28:51] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//no it's pretty funny
[01:28:56] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//i gotta be a nitpicky dick

[01:30:04] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /me would deliver a firm blow to the man's right shoulderblade. Not with all of his possible force, that would be a bit too much, but it's still a good bit of force.
[01:30:32] Denford F. MacMillian: /me the man would recoil from the pain and grunted as a result, his body tensed up and he tried to remain on his feet, mostly succeeding.
[01:31:21] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /me would give the man a moment to feel the pain before hitting him again. He draws his arm back again and delivers another firm blow to the man's left side, in line with his pectorals.

[01:37:22] Denford F. MacMillian: /looc Either way, he'd still be scared of the EpU.
[01:37:23] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.29852: blood type
[01:37:31] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /me would raise his stunstick up, now holding it on its side and in line wiht the citizen's forehead. The stunstick points down towards the citizen's neck.

[01:37:40] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.29852: /viewdata tim
[01:37:59] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.29852: any medical or mental conditions?
[01:37:59] Denford F. MacMillian: /me felt stunned as he looked at the EpU, he was...Scared, a feeling he's never felt in a long time, and he just stared at him and awaited for the EpU to finish...
[01:38:06] Tim Hardmen: None that I know of

[01:38:51] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.29852: ah, great.
[01:38:54] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /me would force the stunstick into the back of the man's upper back and neck, between the two. He lets it sit there for a second, hurting the man with the blunt force at first, and then letting the electricity shock him as well.
[01:39:00] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.29852: need some more... Cooked food around here
[01:39:01] Tim Hardmen: Maybe I can get you a discount

[01:39:37] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /it He doesn't keep it there for long, just three seconds, but for this kind of experience, it likely feels like a very long three seconds. After this time has passed, he brings his stunstick back and keeps it raised, pointed up.

[01:40:31] Tim Hardmen: Yes?
[01:40:33] Tim Hardmen: Alright
[01:40:45] Denford F. MacMillian: /me let out a painful grunt as he felt the shock and the blunt force happening, it may have just been three seconds but it was the most painful three seconds he's felt in a long time...The man would breathe heavily onto the floor, attempting to speak but stopping himself...A wise choice.
[01:41:04] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.29852: /r Citizen is at the nexus.

[01:41:44] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /me would flick his stunstick off and lower it to his side. He takes a step back.
