[22:13:17] CCA.C14-GRID.i3.69192: APCs are easier and faster in city settings.
[22:13:24] CCA.C08-HELIX.i5.50299: True
[22:13:25] CCA.C14-GRID.i3.69192: Anything we would need with a tank is covered by synths.
[22:13:30] CCA.C14-GRID.i3.69192: Like the STR units.
[22:13:49] CCA.C14-GRID.i3.69192: Same speed, if not faster, but more destructive and durable.
[22:13:54] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Yeah, Although I don't think I've ever seen STR units.
[22:14:03] CCA.C08-HELIX.i5.50299: Me either.
[22:14:04] CCA.C14-GRID.i3.69192: .//in the game they patrol in the city regularly
[22:14:07] Laura Crawford: .// out of character whats a STR unit
[22:14:10] CCA.C14-GRID.i3.69192: .//strider
[22:14:13] Laura Crawford: .// oh
[22:14:54] CCA.C08-HELIX.i5.50299: Wish
[22:14:56] CCA.C14-GRID.i3.69192: Back in... what was it, city 27, striders would patrol all the time.
[22:14:59] Rafik Bezrukov: Let me think, Univeral Union yes. This is different from Combine Civil Athority, Yes? So mayor, But mayor not exist in this city. So it must be this City Administor I hear on the big tv outside. That or Commander of Combine Civil Athority, I don't there p-
[22:14:59] CCA.C08-HELIX.i5.50299: /looc void that
[22:15:03] Rafik Bezrukov: proper name.
[22:15:13] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: I'm hoping if any of these units pass that they choose UNION as the Divison they stick to.
[22:15:13] CCA.C08-HELIX.i5.50299: Seems pretty freaky
[22:15:21] CCA.C14-GRID.i3.69192: Same with the AFUs.
[22:15:27] CCA.C08-HELIX.i5.50299: Probally pretty bad to be one of those synths.
[22:15:36] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: hm
[22:15:37] CCA.C14-GRID.i3.69192: /w Zip it.
[22:15:48] CCA.C14-GRID.i3.69192: /w We can't have them thinking synths are fucked up.
[22:16:03] CCA.C14-GRID.i3.69192: Nah, we treat them well. No different from being an attack dog.
[22:16:10] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: Anymore questions for him?
[22:16:14] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: affirmative
[22:16:18] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: Good.
[22:16:18] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: you are close
[22:16:27] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Hm, rather funny to think of a STR unit as a attack dog
[22:17:01] CCA.C08-HELIX.i5.50299: True
[22:17:02] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: who is the military lead of the city?
[22:17:41] CCA.C08-HELIX.i5.50299: I think I've seen one of those OTA like once or twice.
[22:17:53] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Only once or twice?
[22:18:04] CCA.C08-HELIX.i5.50299: Yeah not too comonly.
[22:18:08] CCA.C14-GRID.i3.69192: /pm ofc if they get in, tell them they get in, but then take them downstairs. When the second citizen comes in, yell, "Ready to amputate." and shoot the wall. Then come up and tell the i5 to fill up the water bucket. Trust me it'll be funny.
[22:18:12] CCA.C08-HELIX.i5.50299: /looc commonly*
[22:18:22] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: /pm grid ok bet
[22:18:32] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: I've seen them plenty of times. But I've had a rather good streak of being on duty when bad stuff happens
[22:18:43] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: /pm OfC Fuck yeah, I'll help support the idea of it.
[22:18:54] CCA.C14-GRID.i3.69192: I mean, the OTA cadets are the ones who patrol the QZ.
[22:19:00] CCA.C14-GRID.i3.69192: You'd see them a lot here.
[22:19:06] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: yeah
[22:19:06] Rafik Bezrukov: Ummm, Let me think. You speak of Overwatch. You asked it in way that seem they are seperate from you. So Overwatch must be high up. So Overwatch.
[22:19:08] CCA.C08-HELIX.i5.50299: I mean I only got hospilitized like once from revolver wounds, so pretty lucky on that part.
[22:19:21] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: 357?
[22:19:25] CCA.C08-HELIX.i5.50299: Yep
[22:19:48] CCA.C14-GRID.i3.69192: Revolver wounds? Who'd you piss off?
[22:19:53] Laura Crawford: .// afk
[22:20:03] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Your lucky. That round would probably break multiple bones and bounce around your insides....
[22:20:10] CCA.C08-HELIX.i5.50299: Some citizen was waiting with a gun around the corner.
[22:20:22] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Bullets suck when they perfectly go through armor
[22:20:27] CCA.C08-HELIX.i5.50299: I filled him with lead before he could get off the third shot.
[22:20:52] CCA.C14-GRID.i3.69192: //new rule, but it's official now. if you get killed by the combine within 5 minutes after killing a cp, it's a pk

[22:21:25] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: final question
[22:21:27] CCA.C08-HELIX.i5.50299: Why
[22:21:53] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: congrats you didn't die to a 357, now you just need to get shot with a couple more bullets and you'd have survived most bullets
[22:21:55] CCA.C14-GRID.i3.69192: //CCA.C14-GRID.i3.69192 has set "communityURL" to "https://goatse.ru/".
[22:22:01] CCA.C08-HELIX.i5.50299: I'd rather not.
[22:22:12] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: let's say you become an Officer. A citizen says to you, "You are bad." and walks away. What do you do?
[22:22:19] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Most would rather not
[22:22:23] CCA.C08-HELIX.i5.50299: True

[22:22:50] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Gun manufacturer.

[22:23:08] Laura Crawford: .// back
[22:23:20] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: If you hate the smell of gunpowder and metal then you wouldn't like it
[22:23:47] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: It gave me a good amount of knowledge on how guns work and act so it was good to have.
[22:23:56] Laura Crawford: // You get amputated for -20 LP

[22:25:05] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Start cleaning your gun. You wouldn't leave a knife in the mud and take it out to battle.
[22:25:10] Rafik Bezrukov: I go up to the man, tell him I am not bad. And tell i'm to stay still whole I smack him around with dubinka. Untill he understands that I am not bad person, and he should not spread that myth around.
[22:25:12] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Same principle
[22:25:26] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: /w ooc, when i take him down and do the fake amputation, can you ask him the ooc questions then so its quicker
