[01:06:57] Denford F. MacMillian: Sounds like it.
[01:07:01] Denford F. MacMillian: I'm...Not loyal enough to do it.
[01:07:03] Denford F. MacMillian: System wise.
[01:07:06] Anastasia Ivanovich: perhaps being a Conscript is easier
[01:07:11] Ashley Adams: Yea it is.
[01:07:15] Denford F. MacMillian: Ana, do you just want us to become conscripts and join you?
[01:07:20] Anastasia Ivanovich: partly

[11:29:41] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.08313: What are you doing in the construction zone, and I know the answer isn't playing basketball.
[11:29:59] Ashley Adams: Officer, I wasnt in the CZ after I was arrested the first time.
[11:30:18] Ashley Adams: Ive tried to report more crime instead of causing it.
[11:30:32] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.08313: The only loyal acts on your record are turning in contraband.
[11:30:35] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.08313: You've reported no crime.

[11:32:17] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.08313: This isn't explained by luck.

[11:34:50] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.39867: When I spoke to you before, you told me "somebody must keep leaving it there." Awfully convenient for you to return with more contraband not long after. A knife, no less.
[11:35:04] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.08313: /me would slowly step around the desk.

[11:35:11] Ashley Adams: Im fully aware of how bad this sounds.
