[18:57:23] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: tasers are less impactful.
[18:57:39] CCA.C14-RCT.36307: Still might be useful for suspects fleeing
[18:57:45] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: And whips are harder to keep undercontrol.
[18:58:00] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: Pretty good chance that you could hit your teammate
[18:58:14] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: Decent idea though
[18:58:15] CCA.C14-RCT.36307: that's why you shout taser 3 times
[18:59:23] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: Hm, I do enjoy the idea of a taser. But honestly we have a fine line between shit thats worth tasing somebody for and just letting them run away.
