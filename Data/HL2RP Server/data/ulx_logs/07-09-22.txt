[07:49:31] Denford F. MacMillian: You're trying to convict an innocent man.
[07:49:37] Denford F. MacMillian: I recommend getting your higher up here.
[07:49:40] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.39867: We'll see how innocent you are.
[07:49:48] Denford F. MacMillian: You suck at interrogation.
[07:50:05] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.39867: /me would step around the table
[07:50:06] Denford F. MacMillian: /pm Epu Shots fired :troll:
[07:50:16] Denford F. MacMillian: Your little stick won't do much, I recommend you don't do anything stupid.
[07:50:21] Denford F. MacMillian: Otherwise you'll just beat an innocent man.
[07:50:31] Denford F. MacMillian: Won't look good for our holy benefactors, hm?
[07:51:02] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.39867: /me would flick the stunstick onto low, before jamming it into the citizen's gut, holding it there for several seconds.
[07:51:04] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.39867: /toggleraise
[07:51:42] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.39867: /y You're lying and we both know it.
[07:51:45] Denford F. MacMillian: /me would feel a painful stun as he fell onto the table, he would try to catch his breathe but had struggle for a brief moment...He wouldn't get onto his feet for a bit, coughing from the pain towards his precious Australian gut.
[07:51:49] Denford F. MacMillian: I ask again...
[07:51:51] Denford F. MacMillian: Your proof.
[07:51:56] Denford F. MacMillian: You have none.
[07:52:04] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.39867: Your interactions with one Ashley Adams.
[07:52:10] Denford F. MacMillian: What of her?
[07:52:47] Denford F. MacMillian: /me Salutes the higher ranking individual, even if he doesn't want too.
[07:52:50] Denford F. MacMillian: /looc void.
[07:53:04] Denford F. MacMillian: /pm epu I have the perfect counter if they're trying to use Ash as a card.
[07:53:06] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.39867: We have recieved several detailed accounts of your activity in the restricted zones. We even know how you are breaching the gates. 
[07:53:16] Denford F. MacMillian: Which gates?
[07:53:19] Denford F. MacMillian: Not sure what you're speaking of.
[07:53:22] Denford F. MacMillian: And if Ashley did accuse me.
[07:53:34] Denford F. MacMillian: Would you trust an innocent man or a lady who was convicted for the same charge I'm being accused of?
[07:53:45] Denford F. MacMillian: Quite the shocker, HELIX unit...
[07:53:47] Denford F. MacMillian: Quite.
[07:53:47] Denford F. MacMillian: The.
[07:53:48] Denford F. MacMillian: Shocker.
[07:54:07] Denford F. MacMillian: /me walked around the table, he seemed...Confident, direct.
[07:54:13] Denford F. MacMillian: /looc gonna stop me?
[07:54:33] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.39867: /me grips the citizen and pulls him back, before delivering another swing in the same place.
[07:55:33] Denford F. MacMillian: /me would get pulled back and hit again, the same reaction as before but a little bit worse...He would smile under the mask, but it wasn't quite clear.
[07:55:40] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.39867: Your interactiosn with one Civil Worker's Supervisor.
[07:55:52] Denford F. MacMillian: Ah, yes him.
[07:55:53] Denford F. MacMillian: I do admit.
[07:55:58] Denford F. MacMillian: I was a bit harsh with him.
[07:56:02] Denford F. MacMillian: But he did commit a Level 1 crime.
[07:56:19] Denford F. MacMillian: /pm epu Do you find this entertaining?
[07:56:31] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: /pm Macmillian lowkey yes lol 
[07:56:37] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.39867: A bit harsh? 
[07:56:39] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: /pm Macmillian gonna have to have a talk 
[07:56:40] Denford F. MacMillian: /pm epu The CITIZEN is taking over this interrogation.
[07:56:45] Denford F. MacMillian: yES.
[07:56:47] Denford F. MacMillian: /looc *Yes.
[07:56:48] Denford F. MacMillian: I uhh.
[07:56:57] Denford F. MacMillian: He wouldn't shut his mouth about a pipe in the IC HQ.
[07:57:00] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: /pm Macmillian though I can't see this going well for you? maybe... ?
[07:57:00] Denford F. MacMillian: So I told him to shut up.
[07:57:02] Denford F. MacMillian: By yelling.
[07:57:14] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: /pm Macmillian Atleast with my CP here now 
[07:57:18] Denford F. MacMillian: /pm epu If they continue to beat me and get nothing, they'll look like an ass.
[07:57:25] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.39867: This same individual has given us accounts of your anti-civil activities. You are a *liar.* 
[07:57:26] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: /pm Macmillian he aint gonna let something like this slide
[07:57:39] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.39867: /me stops his boot into the citizen's right foot, pressing down. 
[07:57:54] Denford F. MacMillian: /me would tense up, he didn't do anything but stare at the CP...Then chuckled.
[07:57:55] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.39867: You have been going into the construction zone and sewers.
[07:58:00] Denford F. MacMillian: With what evidence?
[07:58:07] Denford F. MacMillian: Let me ask you this, HELIX.
[07:58:10] Denford F. MacMillian: Would you trust a Loyalist?
[07:58:18] Denford F. MacMillian: Loyalists may be loyal for their own self gain.
[07:58:26] Denford F. MacMillian: Would you trust the Supervisor?
[07:58:42] Denford F. MacMillian: He might just be accusing an innocent man for his own gain.
[07:58:43] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.39867: I'm the one asking the questions.
[07:58:50] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.39867: /me would stomp down into his foot.
[07:58:51] Denford F. MacMillian: And I'm the one providing logic.
[07:59:01] Denford F. MacMillian: /me moved his foot to the right, smiling.
[07:59:13] Denford F. MacMillian: Get your other CP unit here.
[07:59:19] Denford F. MacMillian: You aren't doing a good job at interrogating an innocent man.
[07:59:39] Denford F. MacMillian: /pm EPU I prefer to talk with you on God.
[07:59:48] Denford F. MacMillian: /pm EPU Because this HELIX doesn't know SHIT about interrogations.
[07:59:55] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.39867: /me would set the stunstick onto medium, before deliver a blow just above the man's ear, near his temple area.
[07:59:58] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.39867: /toggleraise
[07:59:59] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.39867: /toggleraise

[08:02:39] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.39867: Either way, this one is tough to crack. We need an interrogation unit.
[08:02:46] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Understood.

[20:57:54] Ethan King: We probably should have done that in hindsight.
[20:57:54] Paul-Henri Cartier: we have not
[20:58:03] Paul-Henri Cartier: a lot of it is actually kind of attached
[20:58:07] Paul-Henri Cartier: .// attatched
[20:58:19] Ethan King: I would imagine we could cut off some of it, get atleast something.
[20:58:32] Kal'Taar: Attattached.
[20:58:32] Ethan King: Lambda uniforms use some OTA armor.
[20:58:37] Paul-Henri Cartier: the only thing that could EASILY be taken would probably be the gloves and boots, but we could probably cut a vest off
[20:58:51] Kal'Taar: It is just armor. Just take it off. This task seems trivial.
[20:58:55] Ethan King: Cutting the vest off and atleast using some of the armor would be nice.
[20:58:59] Kal'Taar: Or perhaps the humans can tie the body to their own.
[20:59:04] Anastasia Ivanovich: /me simply awaited.
[20:59:06] Paul-Henri Cartier: it's not /just/ armour, well it is
[20:59:16] Paul-Henri Cartier: but some parts are grafted to the skin

[20:59:22] Kal'Taar: Then take it off.

[21:05:46] Denford F. MacMillian: /me continued to clean up the wall, he would mainly focus on the bottom part of the barricade and began to wipe off the dust from said wall. He didn't say anything while doing this and kept to himself, just wanting to get the work done, but he was still doing well with his progress, he would then reach to the middle part of the wall, cleaning up the rag before wiping down the wall, and slowly going up towards the upper half, his height being an advantage for this.
[21:05:48] Ethan King: Right, get a cameras attention Paul, preferably one near the slums, and then rush back, if he walks down the alley we'll jump him.
