[16:29:00] Alex Palovichov: Well...What the tasks asked for...
[16:29:12] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.23710 to admins: cool beans
[16:29:26] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.23710: // police assault in progress
[16:29:27] Anna Gottlieb: Did you just count upwards for this list?
[16:29:34] CCA.C17-RCT.06748: /ooc yea XD
[16:29:48] Anna Gottlieb: /toggleraise
[16:29:56] Alex Palovichov: No. 10 was the least and one is the most
[16:30:02] Alex Palovichov: As the task asked
[16:31:12] Alex Palovichov: /chardesc
[16:31:16] Anna Gottlieb: Right, but there's not one place with the same rating, and they count upwards perfectly.
[16:31:28] CCA.C17-RCT.06748: 10-4
[16:31:31] CCA.C17-RCT.06748: 104
[16:31:39] Alex Palovichov: Well, I didn't know if one place could have more than one rating
[16:31:52] Alex Palovichov: So I had to double check alot of different possiblities for It
[16:31:53] CCA.C17-RCT.06748: 10-8
[16:32:03] Alex Palovichov: How close to sewers...CZ...
[16:32:10] Anna Gottlieb: They just so happened to all have a unique number, going perfectly from one to ten?
[16:32:31] Alex Palovichov: Well...Thats how it was told to be done...One to ten.
[16:32:43] Alex Palovichov: I simply had to make longer final calls for a locations number
[16:32:54] Alex Palovichov: To try make it go up perfectly one to ten
[16:33:15] Anna Gottlieb: right, but you don't find it strange that not even one of them had the same ranking?
[16:33:20] Anna Gottlieb: Doesn't that strike you as odd?
[16:33:37] Alex Palovichov: Indeed, I was going to mark others as the same...But I wasn't aware that to be a possibility...
[16:33:46] Alex Palovichov: I thought all of them could only have one location...
[16:33:48] Anna Gottlieb: you don't understand how a ranking system works?
[16:33:56] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.23710 to admins: how long is ashley gonna stay at rct
[16:34:02] Anna Gottlieb to admins: until she's trained
[16:34:07] Anna Gottlieb to admins: no idea why she's still flagged up
[16:34:11] Alex Palovichov: It seems I don't
[16:34:12] Anna Gottlieb: You see two movies and decide to give them 1-5 stars.
[16:34:15] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.23710: /pm rct please flag down
[16:34:15] Anna Gottlieb: But they're both very good.
[16:34:19] Anna Gottlieb: Both perfect movies.

[16:34:26] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.23710 to admins: asked her to flag down
[16:34:30] Anna Gottlieb: But you give one four stars and one five stars.
[16:34:32] CCA.C17-RCT.06748: /ooc woops
[16:34:32] Anna Gottlieb: does that make sense to you?
[16:34:41] CCA.C17-RCT.06748<STEAM_0:0:25179524> changed their name to Ashley Adams
[16:35:01] Alex Palovichov: Indeed, I can see that...But I was simply unaware that I could choose more locations than one...I thought the task was asking for one each...so I do apologize
[16:35:14] Ashley Adams: /reply done
[16:35:15] Anna Gottlieb: you're not giving more than one ranking to one location.
[16:35:21] Anna Gottlieb: You're giving one location one ranking
[16:35:21] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.23710: /pm ashley <3
[16:35:32] Anna Gottlieb: One being it's easy to be infested, ten being it's very hard to be infested.
[16:35:34] Anna Gottlieb: Do you understand now?
[16:35:58] Alex Palovichov: Yes I'm aware of that...I was unaware I could give more than one location the same ranking...
[16:36:09] Anna Gottlieb: How didn't that occur to you?
[16:36:31] Alex Palovichov: I would have thought that the task would've specified that more than one location can be on the same ranking
[16:37:32] Anna Gottlieb: We figured it was self explanatory, because we fiugred you understood how a 1-10 ranking system goes.
[16:37:36] Anna Gottlieb: We thought that was common knowledge.
[16:37:39] Anna Gottlieb: C
[16:37:44] Anna Gottlieb: Common sense
[16:38:17] Alex Palovichov: Indeed, that was I was doing in the first place...Though I was unaware that you would've wanted up to multiple locations per ranking.
[16:38:36] Alex Palovichov: So after I looked over the task and wasn't able to understand if you wanted that I put them down as it is now
[16:39:02] Anna Gottlieb: Right, I'm saying you should have understood that. Because it's *common sense.*
[16:40:31] Alex Palovichov: Indeed it may have been common sense for a normal ranking, though due to it being a different system than I have worked with before I was unaware that it was wanted like that. So I spent longer on each location in order to find a difference between different locations to ensure that they are indeed different on the ranking system
[16:40:47] Anna Gottlieb: So you've never worked with a 1-10 ranking system?
[16:40:58] Anna Gottlieb: Never once in your life have you ever rated things 1 through 10
[16:41:25] Ashley Adams: /ooc Bruh, where the hell is everyone XD
[16:41:27] Alex Palovichov: No I have, I have not worked with a ranking system that was asking for this kind of ranking...I was thinking that it required a different location for each...
[16:42:08] Anna Gottlieb: So the answer is no. You've never worked with a 1 through 10 ranking system, because that's what this is.
[16:42:16] Anna Gottlieb: This is that, but with infestation vulnerability.
[16:42:18] Anna Gottlieb: Exact same thing.
[16:42:34] Anna Gottlieb: So did you not fully read it, or is this your first time using a 1-10 ranking system?
[16:43:22] Alex Palovichov: Thou- I did read the task fully but due to it not being specified I believed that it was wanting a different rank for each
[16:43:46] Anna Gottlieb: Are you deaf, too?
[16:44:04] Anna Gottlieb: *This task* is the same as that. It is a *One through ten system*.
[16:44:05] Alex Palovichov: No, at most minor hearing damage due to gunshots
[16:44:18] Alex Palovichov: Yes I'm aware of that
[16:44:19] Anna Gottlieb: How can you not get this into your head?
[16:44:24] Anna Gottlieb: So you're saying they're different.
[16:44:26] Anna Gottlieb: They're not differnet.
[16:44:34] Anna Gottlieb: You made them different because you're illiterate.
[16:44:39] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.23710: // yes
[16:44:44] Alex Palovichov: I'm not, I was simply stating that I didn-

[20:03:53] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: /r Who the fu-.....attention ground units, why is there an AR2 on my armory desk for no reason?
[20:03:58] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Take a few steps back recruit. I'll have you *line* up here
[20:04:06] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: /r Un-biolocked along with that, espond.
[20:04:10] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: /rooc respond*
[20:04:28] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: /radio 240, reported to be contraband.
[20:04:42] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Right here is fine. Where I'm standing
[20:05:06] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: /r Who t-....Right, returning it to the armory after a thourough investigation, I'll be taking this thing apart.....hope Dispatch doesn't mind.
[20:05:39] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Right, I'm under the assumption that you've atleast *looked* at the operating handbook of the Combine Civil Authority.
[20:05:51] Client "DRD" connected.
[20:05:55] CCA.C17-RCT.06748: Correct, Read it over 4 times.
[20:06:05] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Great
[20:06:15] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: // Considering actually doing the RP to take apart an AR2....
[20:06:19] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: /me says with such exaggeration
[20:06:45] CCA.C17-QrM.98240<STEAM_0:1:17219621> changed their name to Ethan King
[20:06:46] Ethan King: // AGH 
[20:07:08] Client "DRD" spawned in server <STEAM_0:0:193599766> (took 77 seconds).
[20:07:13] Ethan King: // What a bit-
[20:07:20] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Well highlighting the *training* perspective I can't say much of the start will be used in the field however it can be used during parades or the frequent combat scenario.
[20:07:32] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: This being the Faces and Formations.
[20:07:59] DRD<STEAM_0:0:193599766> changed their name to Lucy Chen
[20:08:20] Lucy Chen<STEAM_0:0:193599766> changed their name to Paul-Henri Cartier
[20:08:21] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Just touching on Faces; I'm sure you're aware that when called they are to be either ninty degree turns or one eighty turns...
[20:08:31] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Right face, Left Face... About face.
[20:08:40] CCA.C17-RCT.06748: a Full right or left face is 90 degrees.
[20:08:59] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: /me he sort of nods, "Correct. Correct."
[20:09:29] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Not too many people have a hard time figurin' em' out. So I'm not going to go into detail over it.
[20:10:02] Paul-Henri Cartier: /toggleraise
[20:10:04] Paul-Henri Cartier killed Ethan King using player
[20:10:09] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Formations are hard to describe with only one Unit.
[20:10:21] Paul-Henri Cartier brought Ethan King
[20:10:36] Paul-Henri Cartier gave Ethan King 160 rounds
[20:10:39] Paul-Henri Cartier gave Ethan King 20 rounds
[20:10:45] Paul-Henri Cartier gave Ethan King 100 rounds
[20:10:49] Paul-Henri Cartier gave Ethan King 20 rounds

[20:11:06] Paul-Henri Cartier killed Ethan King using player
[20:11:23] Paul-Henri Cartier gave Ethan King 180 rounds
[20:11:28] Paul-Henri Cartier gave Ethan King 140 rounds
[20:11:39] Paul-Henri Cartier brought Ethan King
[20:11:49] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Typically will see Diamonds to protect high value individuals. Mostly with more combat focused scenarios or individuals such as the transhuman arm.

[20:12:37] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: These two parts; the Faces and Formations arn't of much concern. 
[20:12:51] Paul-Henri Cartier: /y Tabarnak!
[20:12:54] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Divisions however and our ranking structure are.
[20:13:03] Ethan King: /y Let me in!
[20:13:06] Ethan King: Cool
[20:13:08] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Tell me, what are all of our divisions within the Combine Civil Authority?
[20:13:28] Ethan King: Give me a second....
[20:13:36] CCA.C17-RCT.06748: Union, Grid, Helix, And Judge?
[20:13:43] Ethan King: /me slings over his MP7, sitting on the bed and looking over his injuries.
[20:13:45] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Are you sure?
[20:13:45] Ethan King: /roll 30 
[20:13:55] CCA.C17-RCT.06748: 90%

[20:14:21] Paul-Henri Cartier: /chareditbodygroup paul
[20:14:22] Ethan King: /it minor scratches along with a small bit of metal can be seen within his skin, possibly due to a Zombine explosion of some kind....or perhaps from a past battle that he had forgotten.
[20:14:53] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: What of the transhuman arm? They are a seperate entity within the Universal Union. I'm just testing you.
[20:14:57] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: You were correct from the start.
[20:15:04] Paul-Henri Cartier: feeling okay?
[20:15:10] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Union, Grid, Helix, and Judge are our divisions.
[20:15:15] CCA.C17-RCT.06748: /me lowers their head, shakes it from side it side.
[20:15:23] CCA.C17-RCT.06748: /me nods
[20:15:42] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Being apart of a division-
[20:15:56] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Gonna have to call someone 'bout that camera.
[20:16:02] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: That will come later though
[20:16:05] Ethan King: /me huffing, he would grab a small morphine pen, stabbing himself before taking out several small pieces of metal within in skin, taking out a bandage and smearing it with biogel, along with smearing the wounds he had with biogel and wrapping them, ensuring that they would heal properly.
[20:16:13] Ethan King: /looc his*
[20:16:19] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: hm
[20:16:30] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Alright it's back
[20:16:39] CCA.C17-RCT.06748: God, that cameras going crazy
[20:16:45] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Let's move over here actually
[20:16:59] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Perfect.
[20:17:34] Ethan King: alo
[20:17:48] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: As I was going off about... The Divisions act as a *Side* job, or side task... All units patrol, all units go out in the field... Some are just given extra tasks depending on specialization.

[20:19:21] Paul-Henri Cartier: /toggleraise
[20:19:25] Paul-Henri Cartier: /toggleraise
[20:19:38] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Also get a bit in our kit compared to other functionaries.
[20:20:08] Paul-Henri Cartier: ooooh, Otchi Chornia
[20:20:11] Ethan King: You know it?
[20:20:14] Paul-Henri Cartier: yeah
[20:20:21] Ethan King: Cool
[20:20:37] Ethan King: This place is of the few locations in this new world that ain't so bad.
[20:20:39] Ethan King: I'll be honest
[20:20:45] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Grid specializes in the mechanical field- doing general maintenance or constructing combine equipment. Technology is very important with em'... You'll mostly find them in the Gridbay when the day is slow.
[20:21:20] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Helix are our combat medics and generally anything medical related. That's what they take pride n' specialize in.
[20:21:53] CCA.C17-RCT.06748: /chardesc
[20:22:02] Paul-Henri Cartier: yeah, imagine if it was popular, though
[20:22:08] Ethan King: That'd be fuckin' cool 
[20:22:15] Ethan King: Also I'm expecting a CP to walk in any second now.
[20:22:15] Paul-Henri Cartier: we wouldn't be able to go in our out our base from that enterance
[20:22:19] Ethan King: True 
[20:22:29] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Judge is a fairly rare one within our ranks as the tasks can be demanding. You'd specialize in prison maintenance, proceeding with interrogations on suspects, conducting proper and thorough investigations
[20:22:35] Ethan King: Wish our plan to kill a CP worked 
[20:22:39] Paul-Henri Cartier: mhm
[20:22:50] Ethan King: Too bad they seem smarter here than my previous locations.
[20:22:56] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Any major questions at this point?
[20:23:02] CCA.C17-RCT.06748: No, Sir.
[20:23:03] Ethan King: /me chuckles lightly, flicking the safety of his MP7 off as he gazes at the entrance.
[20:23:10] Paul-Henri Cartier: that seems almost like an insult
[20:23:23] CCA.C17-RCT.06748: /looc void
[20:23:23] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Moving to rank structure.
[20:23:24] Ethan King: Take it how you will, but you're seperate from them.
[20:23:32] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: What can you tell me of what you know so far?
[20:23:41] Ethan King: You made the right choice, atleast.
[20:24:15] Ethan King: Ever been on the rooftops?
[20:24:24] Paul-Henri Cartier: of the city? No
[20:24:33] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.24999: // Guess i better carve into some more drywall
[20:24:35] Ethan King: Wanna try? might be nice to do some scouting.
[20:24:37] Ethan King: // based 
[20:24:39] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: // hell ye
[20:24:40] Paul-Henri Cartier: uh
[20:24:44] Ethan King: Huh...
[20:24:55] CCA.C17-RCT.06748: For unions theres Recruit through I1 then theres EPU, Then squad leader, then Officer, Division Leader, then Commander, and finally sectorial.
[20:24:58] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.24999: Uh
[20:25:01] Paul-Henri Cartier: uh
[20:25:04] Ethan King: uh
[20:25:04] CCA.C17-RCT.06748: Pretty Confident in that one.
[20:25:14] Ethan King: Mind closing that door?
[20:25:19] Ethan King: Cool
[20:25:25] Ethan King: /me sniffles
[20:25:27] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.24999: Huh...
[20:25:34] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Can't specifically say *just* for Unions.
[20:25:34] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.24999: Times... change....
[20:25:36] Paul-Henri Cartier: you never saw us here
[20:25:43] Ethan King: Or we let you free 
[20:25:43] CCA.C17-RCT.06748: Thats fair.
[20:25:49] Ethan King: That's an idea 
[20:25:51] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Divisions have a part within the Ground Unit ranks all the way up to Divisional.
[20:25:59] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.24999: /me glances off- looking past them
[20:26:02] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: After that we'll have the Commander and Sectorial Commander.
[20:26:10] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.24999: Change...-
[20:26:16] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: For obvious reasons they're above the Divisions.
[20:26:17] Ethan King: What do you mean?
[20:26:22] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.24999: Times....
[20:26:28] Paul-Henri Cartier: times do indeed change
[20:26:34] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.24999: /me Shivers before refocusing on the man infront of him
[20:26:40] Ethan King: /looc which one 
[20:26:47] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.24999: /me closes
[20:26:50] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.24999: .// u
[20:26:51] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.24999: .// OOC
[20:26:52] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.24999: .// AA
[20:27:11] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Looking in detail the ranks in specific divisions will have unique rollout.
[20:27:23] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: I'm fairly certain you've had a read at those.
[20:27:23] Ethan King: /me sighs, slinging over his MP7 as he nods towards the worker Vort, "I hope we won't have a problem, Vort, if you wish to be free we are....well we might be able to do so."
[20:27:30] CCA.C17-RCT.06748: Correct.
[20:27:37] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.24999: Free?
[20:27:40] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Perfect.
[20:27:46] Ethan King: Shackles gone, that kinda thing.
[20:28:06] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Let's have a look at sociostatus. This is an important one.
[20:28:10] Paul-Henri Cartier: /me would follow Ethan's lead, placing his revolver in a holster on his hip, closing the flap. "We could probably make it happen."
[20:28:11] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.24999: /me mubbles to himself "Times.... Wil.... Change....-Yes..."
[20:28:33] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Various Colour codes with have to measure sociostatus levels.
[20:28:44] Ethan King: My friend here has a good idea of engineering and shit, he can make it happen with the tools we have.
[20:28:49] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: It's our main focus to moniter sociostatus.
[20:28:54] Paul-Henri Cartier: christ, get inside before someone sees us
[20:29:04] Paul-Henri Cartier: we'll talk in the kitchen
[20:29:09] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.24999: Yes, This one shall follow
[20:29:18] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Now that that means is the general anti-civil activity within the widespread area. 
[20:29:34] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Any crime and little infraction has a play into sociostatus.
[20:29:37] Ethan King: /me chuckles softly, sitting on the table, "Right, do you remember your name, Vort?
[20:29:39] Ethan King: /looc "
[20:29:57] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.24999: Name?
[20:30:07] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.24999: This one does not go by a name...
[20:30:19] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: This comes ties into our communication as well; always be diligent with our communications.
[20:30:22] Ethan King: I'm sure you had one at some point, come now.
[20:30:24] Paul-Henri Cartier: really? We have a Vortigaunt friend, goes by the name uh... Shit, King, what's their name?
[20:30:29] Paul-Henri Cartier: Kal something
[20:30:30] Ethan King: Kal'Tar
[20:30:42] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Very important that all units know what you're currently doing and where you are going to be.
[20:30:53] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: This also meets with our Combat Strategy.
[20:31:00] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.24999: Ah...
[20:31:16] Ethan King: /me corrected, sighing as he looked over the Vort worker, "If you don't have a name, we can make it happen, regardless I'd like to know if you'll be willing to cooperate with us once you're free."
[20:31:22] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Now to review the ranks of sociostatus; Green, Yellow, Red, Black.
[20:31:34] Ethan King: Doing such a thing is....difficult, takes time and as such I'd like you to lay low with us for a bit.
[20:31:48] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.24999: This one would have to-... Affirm, these shackles do make it a challenge for memory...
[20:31:54] Ethan King: Right
[20:31:56] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Green in this case would be right now. No reported activity; sightlines on the streets are fairly neutral.
[20:32:24] Ethan King: We'll give you time to rest after the procedure is finished, we don't want to intrude on you, but we'd just like you to assist us in our endeavors.
[20:32:34] Ethan King: You likely won't be put into active combat, do not fear.
[20:32:35] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Yellow is when we have wide spread influence of anti-civil behavior... nothing too crazy or violent yet.
[20:32:57] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Red is where it jumps to a threatning level... evidently violent. 
[20:33:08] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.24999: Hmm.... This one wishes to be this its kin once again...
[20:33:16] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.24999: No matter the cost-
[20:33:21] Ethan King: Right....we can make it happen.
[20:33:28] Ethan King: You are....what did they call it....
[20:33:29] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Black is basically doomsday for em' civs'.... Full Autonomous Judgement.
[20:33:40] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Everyone is to be shot on sight. 
[20:33:45] Ethan King: 'severed' from your Kin, yes? that Vortessence of yours is cut or something....
[20:33:54] Ethan King: Regardless, we can make it happen.
[20:34:06] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Chaos in summery. 
[20:34:12] Paul-Henri Cartier: I'm not sure if I can sever it by myself, could use some help from Kal
[20:34:24] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Onto infractions
[20:34:34] Paul-Henri Cartier: i honestly have little clue how Vortigaunt bindings really work
[20:34:34] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.24999: Yes... this one is bounded- and therfore am unable to use this 'vortessence'
[20:34:45] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.24999: Hmm?
[20:34:46] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: How many types do we have? Or rather *levels* of infractions.
[20:34:47] Ethan King: /me looked over towards Paul, "Paul, please get the necessary tools from our base, we have plenty of CWU shit there, but if you deem it impossible to do the procedure without Kal we can post-pone it.
[20:34:58] Ethan King: /looc "
[20:35:15] CCA.C17-RCT.06748: Seven.
[20:35:34] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Now name them out.
[20:35:34] Ethan King: I will provide security in the mean time, report if you have any problems getting to the base.
[20:35:36] Ethan King: Sound good?
[20:36:17] Paul-Henri Cartier: i think we should wait for Kal, just to be sure
[20:36:36] CCA.C17-RCT.06748: Misdemeanor, Petty Violation, Minor Violation, Major Violation, High Violations, and Capital Violations.
[20:36:42] Ethan King: /me simply sighs, "Right, we can wait then."
[20:37:07] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Right to detail; remembered well.
[20:37:09] Ethan King: /me turns towards the Vort worker, motioning for him to follow, "I am sorry friend, but we will have to post-pone this for now."
[20:37:20] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.24999: .// QUEBEC!?
[20:37:37] Ethan King: /looc hold
[20:37:59] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Misdemeanor are the most common for individual's to be charged with. Action would be for us to bring them to the nearest wall and administer Reeducation. More leaned on a minor reeducation.
[20:38:05] Ethan King: /me grabs onto the Vorts shoulder? quickly speaking to him, "We were not here, you were simply sweeping the dirty floors, sound good?"
[20:38:12] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Something I cannot stress enough
[20:38:19] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.24999: /me Nods
[20:38:23] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Always get them to show identifications first.
[20:38:31] Ethan King: /me nods back, motioning for him to move along, before closing the doors.

[23:24:53] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: /me would sit down at the bench.

[23:25:14] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: /radio U-47 is 10-7.
[23:25:24] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: I figured you would want to give your legs a break.
[23:25:26] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.06748: /radio Unit is out of service
[23:25:37] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: So. What's the occasion? 
[23:25:45] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: /r Unit is 10-7 temporarily for lunch.
[23:25:57] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: So, there was this citizen a bit ago, earlier today.
[23:26:10] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: I forget the name, it was something weird. Harlow or something? You might have run into him.
[23:26:21] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: He was being really disrespectful, bickering like a child, all this stuff.
[23:26:34] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Possibly.
[23:26:49] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.06748: Sounds like someone we had in detainment earlier.
[23:26:49] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: I recal an individual bickerin' about recently. Yeah
[23:26:59] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Yeah, that was him.
[23:27:02] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Out of touch so to speak
[23:27:11] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: If I had to comment on it.
[23:27:18] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: So, I put him in detainment for a cycle because he just won't stop. I didn't charge him with anything, he just went in and went out.
[23:27:29] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: To calm down or work out his.. whatever was causing him to be that way.
[23:27:48] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: So he gets let out, goes to the work desk.
[23:27:57] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: I'm giving him a job and he makes a comment about me being unproductive.
[23:28:15] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: I've learned with my time in the force to not take things like that personally, but yknow, I can't stand for disrespecting the union, yknow?
[23:28:28] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: so I have him get on the wall, I get out of my stunstick, keep in mind this is my second time re-educating him.
[23:28:31] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.06748: *cough* trial for ampuation *cough*
[23:28:34] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.06748: Im kidding.
[23:28:48] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: I've had to hit em' multiple times.
[23:29:01] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.06748: Ive wanted to hit him multiple times
[23:29:01] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Trial for amputation is for bad offenders.
[23:29:08] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Why wanted to hit him?
[23:29:16] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Anyways.
[23:29:18] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Was *this* close to haven em' marked in more detainment.
[23:29:34] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: He was being a real pest, disrespectful and all that, you know the type.
[23:29:40] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: I gotta re-educate him, that's part of our job.
[23:29:45] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: So I do that, but he won't let up.
[23:29:49] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: So... I get mad.
[23:29:53] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Several counts of 249; that I can add.
[23:29:54] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: And I hit him again. And again.
[23:29:59] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: He fell to the ground...
[23:30:08] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: /me would start to sound distant and bothered.
[23:30:11] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Uhuh...?
[23:30:11] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: I hit him in the head...
[23:30:18] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Dead?
[23:30:21] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: No..
[23:30:24] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: And uh.. I kicked him while he was down.
[23:30:34] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: And I kicked him again and again, and I hit him, and..
[23:30:37] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: I lost my temper.
[23:30:42] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: In a way I haven't before.
[23:30:52] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: I ran to that bathroom there.
[23:30:58] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: /me motions with his head to the bathroom.
[23:31:01] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: .// thats a bathroom now lol?
[23:31:03] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: And I wretched for a bit.
[23:31:06] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: .//that's how i treat it, idk
[23:31:08] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: .//anyways
[23:31:19] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: How are you now?
[23:31:24] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Shaken up? Disturbed?
[23:31:29] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: I know re-education is part of the job.
[23:31:30] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: I accept that.
[23:31:43] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Better now though since you've vented out?
[23:31:45] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: The Combine is here, they've given us a new way to live and operate. I've had many a re-education in my day, I get it.
[23:31:54] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Kind of? I wanted to get your thoughts.
[23:32:07] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: I don't take joy in re-education, none of us do, because we're not sociopaths or monsters.
[23:32:13] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: This is just... how the world works.
[23:32:22] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: For better or worse, we have to do a bit of hitting sometimes.
[23:32:38] Alex Palovichov: /ooc I do be pining tho
[23:32:42] Alex Palovichov: /ooc pinging*
[23:32:53] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: I've re-educated that individual on a few counts. Whilst they were in detainment I had them... *communicate* more... reasonably towards us.
[23:32:56] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: But, I never felt emotionally invested in it. Re-educating is just part of it, like filing paperwork or changing the tires on an APC
[23:32:57] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Seems he's lost it though
[23:33:12] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: But this time, I felt.. invested in... hitting him.
[23:33:24] Alex Palovichov: /ooc Also Q NOW I'm finished the final task
[23:33:33] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: You should treat re-educating as that. Nothing more, nothing less then your usual day to day task.
[23:33:33] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: I don't like it, and I don't want to like it, none of us should like it, it's just the job.
[23:33:36] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Exactly.
[23:33:41] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Do you ever have times like that?
[23:33:48] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Where you get pushed to your breaking point?
[23:33:51] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: And.. lose your temper?
[23:33:57] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.06748: Yes.
[23:34:25] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Only when I've felt threatened would I latch out like that. Isolating myself from them is the best thing I can recomend. Before you go out... like that
[23:34:38] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: .// yourself*
[23:34:47] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Right.
[23:34:54] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: I guess that's just part of me. A temper.
[23:35:02] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Especially when they're locked up like that. They can't run... you can take your time
[23:35:07] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: I should keep it under control like I keep the rest of myself under control.
[23:35:25] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Keep up that tough guy facade, yknow?
[23:35:30] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Just take your time... think diligently before your actions.
[23:35:41] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: That's the idea.
[23:35:55] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Thanks.
[23:36:00] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: I really appreciate that.
[23:36:09] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.06748: It might be benefital to have another unit with you, Just to make sure your okay.
[23:36:30] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: We have a medical division for a reason sometimes... Hah.
[23:36:33] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Good point. Someone to tap me on my shoulder.
[23:36:40] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.06748: Yea.
[23:36:42] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: And say "hey, he's down, he's learned his lesson."
[23:36:56] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Mental Status of our functionaries is something they should take into consideration.
[23:37:03] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.06748: Its what I did to officer back before all this.
[23:37:04] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Yeah.
[23:37:20] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Can't say it's my specialty however I can say they'll have more insight. 
[23:37:39] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: True. Maybe anger management is good. Or healthy. Breathing exercises?
[23:37:40] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Heh.
[23:37:52] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.06748: haha
[23:37:54] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: imagine if the citizens heard us having this conversation, we'd never hear the end of it.
[23:38:01] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: I'd say with you... a good breather or break would be working in the Grid Bay.
[23:38:09] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Divisional would have our asses on a plaque.
[23:38:21] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: True, I've got that time.
[23:38:28] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: And.. that's my job.
[23:38:33] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Second job, at least.
[23:38:33] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Yup.
[23:38:45] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.06748: All I can recomend Is just always having another officer with you, All times.
[23:39:06] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Especially with *that* individual... Yeah that's a two person job.
[23:39:13] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.06748: Agreed
[23:39:16] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.06748: haha
[23:39:19] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Sad to say though two Helix units almost went through the same experience.
[23:39:21] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: He's a handful.
[23:39:28] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: So I can't say you're the only one Grid.
[23:39:28] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Really?
[23:39:39] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Close to yeah. Civ gave em' a hard time as well
[23:39:44] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.06748: God to be honest we should just gag him, He dosent know how to shut his trap
[23:39:51] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: I managed.
[23:39:55] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: I mean, let's not.
[23:39:59] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Be hasty.
[23:40:04] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: He's boisterous, he hasn't learned yet.
[23:40:08] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: That's why we're here.
[23:40:15] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: we need to educate them to live the better way.
[23:40:21] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.06748: Dont worry, I wasnt going to.
[23:40:21] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Throw away all that old Earth society stuff.
[23:40:31] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Educate is right. I got em' to work for a bit n' that seemed to do the trink
[23:40:36] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: .// trick*
[23:40:42] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.06748: /me reaches into my pocket and pulls out my old police pin
[23:40:47] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Talked to us normally n' respectfully.
[23:40:50] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.06748: yea cant throw all this away.
[23:40:57] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: For that short moment...
[23:41:00] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.06748: /me puts it back
[23:41:17] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: All about that tough guy act.
[23:41:22] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Way I do is always be direct.
[23:41:32] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Simple streight to the point n' direct.
[23:41:32] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Yeah. It's a hard balance to strike.
[23:41:36] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: It is.
[23:41:59] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: You need to be intimidating enough for people to think twice about getting in your way
[23:42:15] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: But you still need to be helpful and do the other part of your job.
[23:42:26] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Yknow, the actual part of it. Not just looking scary, but actually helping people.
[23:42:34] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.06748: Being a OFficer,
[23:42:36] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Appearance plays a part in that, but action does way much more
[23:42:39] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Either helping them accept the Union or helping them in just.. day to day things
[23:42:58] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Yeah. What you say and do is a lot.
[23:43:36] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Well, thanks, 347.
[23:43:38] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: I appreciate it.
[23:43:46] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Any time.
[23:44:11] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Not my specialty in having talks like this with Ground Units, but I suppose I should be expecting more from the future.
[23:44:20] Client "Mr.Ganar" connected.
[23:44:27] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: I think these kinds of things are healthy. People need guidance sometimes.
[23:44:28] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Had a few chats recently with the newer recruits and ground protection units.
[23:44:28] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.06748: Yep, You 100% should.
[23:44:31] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: You did fine, in my opinion.
[23:44:43] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: That's good to know.
[23:44:52] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: You said what I needed to hear
[23:45:19] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Least I could do is get ya' back on your feet.
[23:45:42] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: For sure. You're a leader, not just in giving orders.
[23:45:49] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: .// when that bgm hits hard

[23:47:21] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Alright, I should get back on duty.
[23:47:29] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Seriously, thank you.
[23:47:29] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Yup.
[23:47:32] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: No worries.

[23:48:46] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: /me would give the EpU a firm handshake. Behind his mask, he'd be smiling, look at the EpU with a thankful look, but of course, that's not visible.
[23:48:57] CCA.C17-UNION.EpU.93347: Glad you're doin' better... That's part of my responsibility lookin' after you guys anyway.
