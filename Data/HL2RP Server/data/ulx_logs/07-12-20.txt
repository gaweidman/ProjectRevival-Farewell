[18:29:38] Natalie Sarkova: What proof do you have to back up this claim?
[18:29:42] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: And she says that her DOB is 107-
[18:29:47] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: .// 1970*
[18:29:53] Natalie Sarkova: Yes, I am 31
[18:29:57] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: .// I just fucking died on the keyboard
[18:29:59] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Hm
[18:30:10] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.36307: Doubtful
[18:30:15] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: And she called her DOB 1982 before quickly changing it
[18:30:18] Natalie Sarkova: I take this up with supervisor if you continue, you are physically and verbally harassing me
[18:30:25] Natalie Sarkova: I told you, was mistake
[18:30:32] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: This isn't physical, i haven't touched you
[18:30:36] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: And it's not verbal
[18:30:42] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.36307: How the hell do you mistake your birthdate?
[18:30:42] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Simply asking you questions

[18:30:54] Natalie Sarkova: Yes it is
[18:30:56] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Simply asking questions
[18:30:59] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Now then
[18:31:11] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: She has never been tested for diseases before
[18:31:18] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Apparently
[18:31:19] Natalie Sarkova: Not my fault
[18:31:34] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Which how the hell has she not been tested atleast once in her life

[18:32:25] Natalie Sarkova: What?
[18:32:27] Natalie Sarkova: Obviously not

[18:33:30] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: .// gonna wait for the i5 so we have two POV's sorry
[18:33:40] Natalie Sarkova: .// why do you need 2 povs
[18:34:28] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: .// Eh, solidifies the prosecution if I have another person who gives his own ideas on the situation (Also remember that CCA is corrupt as fuck)
[18:34:36] Natalie Sarkova: .// you do realise epu can judge for themselves 
[18:34:42] Natalie Sarkova: .// epu isnt corrupt lol

[18:35:40] Natalie Sarkova: .// you can train and drive an APC
[18:36:08] Natalie Sarkova: .// you are one rank below officer, you've been union washed and brainwashed, they wouldn't risk putting someone into EPU without union/brainwashing 
[18:36:24] Natalie Sarkova: .// you have too much senior responsibilities to not get brainwashed lol
[18:36:48] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: .// wait a moment.......what do you think I mean when I say I'm corrupt?
[18:36:56] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: .// We might be on two different pages here lmao

[18:37:50] Natalie Sarkova: .// wdym
[18:38:11] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: .// When I say "Corrupt" that just means I'm a total dickhole pretty much
[18:38:29] Natalie Sarkova: .// "having or showing a willingness to act dishonestly in return for money or personal gain"
[18:38:32] Natalie Sarkova: .// thats what corrupt is
[18:38:39] Natalie Sarkova: .// so accepting bribes and shit
[18:38:42] Natalie Sarkova: .// things an i5 would do
[18:38:50] Natalie Sarkova: .// EpU can't be corrupt, being an asshole isnt corrupt
[18:38:56] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: .// Fair
[18:39:25] Natalie Sarkova: .// you have mistaken the word corrupt for something else
[18:39:26] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Hm....i5 give me your opinion on this. As a i5 you of course need to also work on prosecuting.
[18:39:30] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: .// Ye
[18:39:40] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.36307: There's no way she's 31.
[18:39:56] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Hm....but we have no real way to prove that.
[18:40:00] Natalie Sarkova: You have no way of telling this
[18:40:04] Natalie Sarkova: Look at it this way
[18:40:32] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.36307: .// would any pre-war records have been preserved you think?
[18:40:42] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: .// Maybe
[18:40:43] Natalie Sarkova: I am a loyalist. If you kill one of your own and then find out later you were wrong, what would you do?
[18:40:50] Natalie Sarkova: Most likely face punishment
[18:40:53] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: .// Imma actually ask Q about that
[18:41:03] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.36307: sir
[18:41:25] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.36307: Do we have any pre-war records preserved?
[18:41:31] Natalie Sarkova: .// where would you get that
[18:41:41] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.36307: .// probably digitized 
[18:42:04] Natalie Sarkova: .// i was literally born a couple of years before the invasion, i havent been processed
[18:42:11] Natalie Sarkova: .// 
[18:42:18] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.36307: .// birth certificate
[18:42:30] Natalie Sarkova: .// where would you find that if i wasnt processed
[18:42:51] Natalie Sarkova: .// who would have my birth certificate
[18:43:21] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: .// that would tell us that you were young either way probably, and if you were never proccessed into the index during the Combine takeover you would be a Non-Citizen
[18:43:37] Natalie Sarkova: .// wdym
[18:43:57] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: .// Kinda like how Gordon Freeman freaked out the Combine once he got their because he was never documented
[18:44:15] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: .// So all of the camera and shit would go red because you were never documented
[18:45:48] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Boomer
[18:45:50] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: .// Void
[18:46:19] Natalie Sarkova: .// ive obviously been processed at some point. i'm not gordon freeman. there's records of me but all of them say the same shit. otherwise i would've been apprehended before i even got here. on my document it says i've been through multiple cities.
[18:46:23] Natalie Sarkova: .// the combine have no way
[18:46:30] Natalie Sarkova: .// of checking my documents
[18:46:35] Natalie Sarkova: .// they dont have access
[18:46:42] Natalie Sarkova: .// to the world populations documents
[18:47:01] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: .// Welp........then we don't really have anyway to prove you wrong so wonderful
[18:47:01] Natalie Sarkova: .// nor did they have any way of telling if someones documents were forged
[18:47:11] Natalie Sarkova: .// because they were human documents with human seals
[18:47:42] Natalie Sarkova: .// you're stumped at the minute until you somehow dig up my birth certificate and documents, and idk how you'd do that
[18:48:03] Natalie Sarkova: .// icly my data says i've been processed through like 3 cities before 14
[18:48:23] Natalie Sarkova: .// all evidence you have currently point to the fact that it was a mistake
[18:48:28] Natalie Sarkova: .// the initial dob given
[18:48:53] Natalie Sarkova: .// many people look young for their age, i could pass it off as good genes
[18:49:04] Natalie Sarkova: .// 31 isnt even really old either
[18:49:10] Natalie Sarkova: .// its legit early 30s
[18:49:48] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: .// Actually wait a moment....i'm talking with Q and just realised something....how did you not get amputated by the Combine when they were killing off underaged people?
[18:49:58] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: // We never put them in camps
[18:50:08] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: .// Just killed off everybody who is underage
[18:50:10] Natalie Sarkova: // then how were cremators made
[18:50:23] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: // Normal manufactoring just without the Children
[18:50:32] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: // Not like they NEED children to be made lmao
[18:50:37] Natalie Sarkova: // ok then thats a different story, there isnt any lore document that was given to me at all
[18:50:49] Natalie Sarkova: // with cremators being a thing i assumed so did camps
[18:51:15] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: // We're a mix of re-tail and beta so we have the Airex and also nova prospect
[18:51:20] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: // Shit like that
[18:51:28] Natalie Sarkova: // there needs to be a lore write-up
[18:51:33] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: // I agree
[18:51:46] Natalie Sarkova: // because how are new players supposed to know that
