[00:03:14] Anastasia Ivanovich: Am I saying that right?
[00:03:30] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Yes, absolutely. I think she's in the precinct at the moment if you'd like to talk to her.
[00:03:44] Anastasia Ivanovich: Alright.
[00:03:54] Anastasia Ivanovich: Is she in the CWU building?
[00:04:31] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: No, she's in the nexus. I'm not sure on what business, but I can try to page her and bring her over.
[00:04:45] Anastasia Ivanovich: Alright. That's... Great I guess. I can wait though if she's busy however
[00:04:48] Anastasia Ivanovich: I don't mind that
[00:05:08] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: I'll try and see.

[00:11:51] Anna Gottlieb: Hi, you're Anastasia?
[00:11:57] Anastasia Ivanovich: greetings Ma'am. I uhh. Would like to speak to you about obtaining a shop license. Though I'm... Not sure my shop would be... K- Yes ma'am.
[00:12:01] Anastasia Ivanovich: /apply
[00:12:22] Anna Gottlieb: Great, let me step out, we can talk.
[00:12:45] Anna Gottlieb: Right, so, we're not like other cities. Shops aren't done with a license.
[00:12:54] Anastasia Ivanovich: well. I'd like to run a Gym- Oh... Well. That changes things. Uhh.
[00:13:06] Anna Gottlieb: Instead, we grant CWU commerce members to own their own places under the protection of the combine.
[00:13:10] Anna Gottlieb: Judicially speaking, of course.
[00:13:11] Anastasia Ivanovich: Ah
[00:13:13] Anastasia Ivanovich: I see
[00:13:27] Anastasia Ivanovich: Well, I ain't a CWU Commerce member. I didn't know that was a thing
[00:13:32] Anna Gottlieb: That said, you would have to join the Commerce corps. But it's a great idea, and I'm interested in it.
[00:13:33] Client "LynxQueen" connected.
[00:14:05] Anastasia Ivanovich: I suppose that can be arranged quickly. I'd like to help with the city as much as I can.
[00:14:25] Anna Gottlieb: Absolutely, we're always looking for new members.
[00:14:34] Anna Gottlieb: one moment...
[00:14:36] Anastasia Ivanovich: I uhh, Believe I had nine LP.
[00:14:39] Anastasia Ivanovich: alright

[00:20:10] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: /me would place both cards in the window.
[00:20:15] Anastasia Ivanovich: /me takes them both.
[00:20:22] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Your CWU ID card does not replace the regular ID card.
[00:20:29] Anastasia Ivanovich: I suspect not
[00:20:33] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.49620: // I need to find someone I can sell mechanical scrap to
[00:20:36] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: For the sake of safety, you always need the regular card, and we only count that as identification.
[00:20:45] Anastasia Ivanovich: /me nodded.
[00:21:14] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: the CWU ID card is to help verify membership and open doors. This isn't like the US government where a driver's license and a passport are both valid ID.

[00:26:43] Anastasia Ivanovich: wait there's a dumpster around?
[00:26:43] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: We have vortipodes and cleaners take this to the incineration plant
[00:26:50] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: I mean, there's dumpsters everywhere.
[00:26:55] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: .//there's workibng dumpster container entities around

[00:27:27] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: Yeah, we're still setting up some industrial things. Keep in mind, this city just reopened.
