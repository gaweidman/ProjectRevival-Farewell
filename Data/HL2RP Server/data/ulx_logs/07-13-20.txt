[15:06:28] Gordo Kin: Hm....how much more is reinforced?
[15:06:34] Gordo Kin: In terms of price
[15:07:09] Ben Chomizack: Standard is around 15 tokens, while reinforced is 30. Though the reinforced is both bullet proof and resistant to anything trying to break it.
[15:07:21] Gordo Kin: And how much is a crate?
[15:07:55] Ben Chomizack: Well crates can break easily, so I'd suggest a better alternative.
[15:08:05] Gordo Kin: Hm.....I'm listening

[16:25:51] Emily Brown: I found it in the alleyways, and wanted to hand it into the EpU. I told him I had a crowbar and he said not now, so I went back to the alleyway to go to my shop
[16:26:02] Emily Brown: I got attacked by crabs, so I ran to the unit
[16:26:07] Emily Brown: And I told him where they were
[16:26:10] Emily Brown: Then I gave it back
[16:26:19] CCA.C08-HELIX.i5.50299: Hm

[16:40:34] Emily Brown: Okay
[16:40:50] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: Now, I'll start this off with asking what your story was.
[16:41:35] Emily Brown: Alright, first off, I'm just going to tell you that I meant no harm at all. I have had nothing questionable on my record and previous records, and I was only using the crowbar for self-defence whenever I was attacked by the headcrab, lowering it in the-
[16:41:37] Emily Brown: -presence of the unit.
[16:41:51] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: Going to stop you for a second.
[16:41:57] CCA.C08-HELIX.i5.50299: /oldviewdata emily
[16:42:15] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: If you are near a unit, you have no reason to use self defense.
[16:42:22] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: Got it?
[16:42:26] Emily Brown: Yeah
[16:42:28] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: Contiune.
[16:43:12] Emily Brown: I found the crowbar in the alleyways, and when I came out of the alleyway I saw the black-masked unit with blue eyes.
[16:43:22] Emily Brown: So I wanted to give it in, but he told me he was busy.
[16:43:33] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: Hm
[16:43:33] Emily Brown: I told him I had it, and he told me that he couldn't do anything right now
[16:43:45] Emily Brown: Whenever he was busy the other times I have tried to hand in contraband,
[16:43:52] Emily Brown: He usually told me to store it in my locker at my store
[16:44:00] Emily Brown: So that is what I assumed he wanted me to do with the crowbar
[16:44:05] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: God-fucking-damnit.
[16:44:22] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: Next time, go find another unit immediatly. Do not store it anywhere.
[16:45:16] Emily Brown: Noted, however I could not find any other units and like I said, the black-masked unit retreated through the forcefield after telling me he was busy
[16:45:35] Emily Brown: So I put it into my storage to make sure no one took it
[16:45:41] Emily Brown: And that's what I thought I was expected to do
[16:45:49] Emily Brown: Since that is what I've been told to do on previous occasions
[16:46:03] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: IF there are no units, do not store it. Simply wait for one to get on duty, or wait for the one you just asked to finish up.

[16:58:03] Emily Brown: Okay

[16:58:54] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I saw a filing cabinet go missing a while ago
[16:58:58] Gordo Kin: Hm.....that is a good point.
[16:59:12] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: So I wouldn't be surprised if someone took it, or they got CCA down here at some point
[16:59:20] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Or... OTA.
[16:59:25] Gordo Kin: Where should I put it though....

[17:00:04] Gordo Kin: You can lead the way, I'll bring it
[17:00:20] Gordo Kin: // Pain can you phys gun this with us
[17:00:22] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Here, I can lift it up.
[17:00:27] Gordo Kin: Sure, I guess
[17:00:29] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Well, when we get to the balcony.
[17:01:00] Gordo Kin: .// lmao
[17:01:32] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Anyway behind this?
[17:01:36] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Out of curiosity
[17:01:48] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: It... looks more functional than the one I came through to get to City 14.
[17:01:55] Gordo Kin: I believe so, but it's also locked so at the moment it's impossible to go here.
[17:02:01] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Damn.

[17:04:14] Gordo Kin: Yeah
[17:04:25] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Alrighty.
[17:04:28] Gordo Kin: I want to explore the QZ but we need soem hazmat suits
[17:04:31] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: A lot... safer of a area Combine wise
[17:04:33] Gordo Kin: .// Some*
[17:04:37] Gordo Kin: Yeah
[17:04:48] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Hazmat suits... maybe. I have a gas mask, but it doesn't have any filters.
[17:05:08] Gordo Kin: Hm.......we could always mug a unit without killing them....
[17:05:16] Gordo Kin: Maybe their filters would work...
[17:05:24] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I... couldn't come with you on that venture
[17:05:37] Gordo Kin: Hm......understandable
[17:05:39] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: If they know I'm here, and report it, people could get really fucked.
[17:06:09] Gordo Kin: Yeah.....your identity is a bit of a nuisance isn't it....
[17:06:11] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: They completely flooded the Outlands due to actions of a few anarchists. They knew I was hiding out there.
[17:06:17] Gordo Kin: Jesus.....
[17:06:18] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: They would flood down here, most likely.
[17:06:27] Gordo Kin: Hm......how.....terrifying
[17:06:44] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I'm tired of those fuckin Hunters. I would prefer fighting a Antlion fists only than to fight a Hunter ever again.
[17:06:53] Gordo Kin: Hunters?
[17:07:05] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Yeah. They look like... small striders?
[17:07:08] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Except blue.
[17:07:27] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Fire some sort of explosive round that digs into your flesh before going off.
[17:07:33] Gordo Kin: Oh my.....
[17:07:34] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Hell, not even a bullet.
[17:07:42] Gordo Kin: thats rather scary...
[17:07:46] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Yeah...
[17:08:05] Gordo Kin: Well I probably won't be seeing them anytime soon, the most you see down here is just fucking zombies and headcrab
[17:08:11] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Thank fuck.
[17:08:18] Gordo Kin: Yeah....makes living a lot easier
[17:08:23] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: At least headcrab makes for... a alright... food.
[17:08:42] Gordo Kin: I've never tried headcrab....purhaps I'll have to get onto that someday
[17:08:44] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I can't ever stop burning the skin though. Always turns out leathery
[17:08:49] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Eugh...
[17:09:04] Gordo Kin: Hm...purhaps your ability to cook will need some improvements
[17:09:10] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Maybe.
[17:09:16] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I've only been using that fireplace down here.
[17:09:41] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I've been thinkin bout setting up here at least.
[17:09:45] Gordo Kin: Uh....and how long do you put them on the fire for?
[17:09:57] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Only around... 7-8 minutes
[17:10:09] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I try to cook them pretty deeply to kill whatever alien bacteria is in them
[17:10:20] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Works out well.
[17:10:25] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Tastes bad though.
[17:10:40] Gordo Kin: Hm.....considering this is a unregulated fire purhaps cutting the headcrab into pieces and then cooking them for a little less time would be a bit more affective
[17:10:50] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Yeah, maybe.
[17:11:03] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Antlions at least tasted surprisingly meaty.
[17:11:10] Gordo Kin: Really....
[17:11:14] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I don't get why people say headcrabs taste like chicken though...
[17:11:18] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Fuckin bullshit I say.
[17:11:31] Gordo Kin: Maybe they put that into their head to feel better about what their eating
[17:11:40] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Probably. Hm... question.
[17:11:45] Gordo Kin: Hm?
[17:11:47] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: You have access to a working computer monitor?
[17:11:52] Gordo Kin: No sorry
[17:11:55] Gordo Kin: Why?
[17:12:01] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Shit, I found this a while ago. It has all the parts n shit.
[17:12:08] Gordo Kin: Oh my
[17:12:20] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Been trying to figure out a way to power it on.
[17:12:21] Gordo Kin: That is rather rare
[17:12:25] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Yeah.
[17:12:28] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Might contain something useful
[17:12:35] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I took it when I left City 08 for the better.
[17:12:53] Client "Madeline Wuntch" connected.
[17:13:01] Gordo Kin: Hm.....maybe if I find anything that could work for it we can see
[17:13:10] Gordo Kin: If it has a password we're fucked though
[17:13:17] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Yeah
[17:13:36] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I might be able to get into it though.
[17:13:43] Gordo Kin: Hm......hopefully..
[17:14:16] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: But that might be me having wishful thinking
[17:14:24] Gordo Kin: Purhaps
[17:14:38] Gordo Kin: Where was city 08 located again?
[17:14:44] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Japan.
[17:14:47] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Or what was left of it.
[17:14:53] Gordo Kin: Uh......
[17:15:00] Gordo Kin: We're in Russia my friend
[17:15:15] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Jesus. I knew I was in Europe, but goddamn.
[17:15:54] Gordo Kin: Yeah.......are you still living by chance. Because I think you have gone beyond the limit of what a Human body can do just by walking all the way here
[17:16:13] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Haha, I dunno. For a long while, Antlion is what fueled me.
[17:16:46] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Then again, this wasn't exactly my first time surviving outside of cities for long periods of times.
[17:16:51] Gordo Kin: I see
[17:16:58] Gordo Kin: How was city 08 before the accident?
[17:17:11] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I don't know. I never got in.
[17:17:18] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Didn't have a reason
[17:17:20] Gordo Kin: So you were in the outlands?
[17:17:24] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Yeah
[17:17:32] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I was trying to get into a bunker at the time.
[17:17:42] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Hmph... I wonder...
[17:17:47] Gordo Kin: Oh my, did you have any assistance-
[17:17:49] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: There was this guy I saw a while ago there.
[17:18:07] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Some guy managed to get a Civil Protection uniform. He disappeared one day. Never knew what happened to him.
[17:18:08] Gordo Kin: .// Ethan time
[17:18:23] Gordo Kin: Oh my......hopefully he is still out their....
[17:18:29] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I... can't remember his name well. Ethan... maybe?
[17:18:35] Client "Madeline Wuntch" connected.
[17:18:47] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: He seemed like a trustworthy guy at the time.
[17:18:57] Gordo Kin: Hopefully the Combine didn't get to uhim
[17:19:01] Gordo Kin: .// Him*
[17:19:05] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Yeah.
[17:19:55] Gordo Kin: Well....at some point tomorrow i'll simply mug a unit, I have a rather large needle that if need be I can use.
[17:20:00] Client "Madeline Wuntch" spawned in server <STEAM_0:0:193599766> (took 85 seconds).
[17:20:06] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Alright. If you are going to try that...
[17:20:10] Gordo Kin: I don't want to kill if I don't have to-
[17:20:17] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Use that to get away if you get out of sight
[17:20:24] Gordo Kin: Thank you, I will
[17:20:33] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: It's a bit dirty, but you guys have a laundromat, right?
[17:21:01] Gordo Kin: Yes we do, I can use it if need be but the shirt itself will only be used for a quick get away.
[17:21:08] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Alright
[17:21:25] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Best to clean yourself up before then. Look like a Loyalist.
[17:21:33] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Loyalists wear whiteshirts here... right?
[17:21:40] Gordo Kin: Yes they do
[17:21:46] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Great.
[17:22:16] Gordo Kin: I'll clean myself up at some point, we have that water near that small base thats clean enough I guess
[17:22:23] Gordo Kin: Not like I can get much other clean water
[17:22:37] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Yeah...
[17:22:43] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I've been having to drink that shit.
[17:22:48] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: But eh, at least I have a way to boil it
[17:22:53] Gordo Kin: yeah
[17:23:26] Gordo Kin: These metro's have abundant amounts of supplies for free use...their just a little dirty
[17:23:33] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Yeah.
[17:23:38] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I should scour around here sometime
[17:23:46] Gordo Kin: Feel free
[17:23:46] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Maybe see if I can take a CID from one of those zombies
[17:23:49] Madeline Wuntch<STEAM_0:0:193599766> changed their name to CCA.C14-UNION.i5.36307
[17:24:01] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I won't be able to use it, but it would be useful.
[17:24:06] Gordo Kin: Yeah
[17:24:48] Gordo Kin: I just......don't really know how to contrabute to the right rebels.....at the moment I'm more of a sewer dweller so to speak
[17:25:07] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Trust me, better to not contribute than to contribute the wrong people.
[17:25:17] Gordo Kin: Yeah...
[17:25:25] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I haven't seen a strong presence of rebel cells here.
[17:25:33] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: So... I've been weary of who to trust
[17:25:39] Gordo Kin: Thats good
[17:25:47] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I saw a loyalist down here once, but he was terrified of his life.
[17:25:53] Gordo Kin: Oh my
[17:26:03] Gordo Kin: Why the hell was a loyalist down here?
[17:26:04] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: He ran out before I could ask him.
[17:26:15] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: It was during that really fuckin... weird storm.
[17:26:24] Gordo Kin: Oh.....that 
[17:26:35] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Thank god I was barely touched by it.
[17:26:38] Gordo Kin: Good
[17:26:57] Gordo Kin: I saw a few aliens but mostly hid inside a few bases
[17:27:12] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Good. At some point i want to clear out that big fucking... thing
[17:27:18] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: In that hall

[22:26:22] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.36307: // we have a tram from nomad to the nexus?
[22:26:31] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: // One way and need to be called for it.

[22:27:54] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: That yours?
[22:28:11] Gordo Kin: No, if I'm unmistaken it has deactivated manhacks in it
[22:28:25] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: E-Excuse me...? How the fuck did you manage that?
[22:28:52] Gordo Kin: not me, I simply assisted with the people who did.
[22:29:06] Gordo Kin: Understandably don't tell anybody I told you that
[22:29:09] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Hmph. Mind if I get their name? Unless of course, they want you to keep quiet.
[22:29:32] Gordo Kin: They wanted me to keep quiet about everything about them unless I know that you are a rebel
[22:29:44] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: /me chuckled a bit at what Kin just told him, saying "As if I could tell anyone."
[22:29:55] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Either way, that's understandable.
[22:30:06] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I won't pursue further, for their own's sake.
[22:30:20] Gordo Kin: but I'll probably tell you more since you are through and through a rebel....
[22:30:24] Gordo Kin: maybe at some point
[22:31:07] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: The fuck does Diva Roach mean?
[22:31:14] Gordo Kin: No fucking clue
[22:31:20] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I found a... chicken nugget.
[22:31:23] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Right below it
[22:31:28] Gordo Kin: W-What?
[22:31:29] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I fucking bashed it with my pipe.
[22:31:35] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: It was... covered in something
[22:31:39] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Smelt horrible.
[22:31:40] Gordo Kin: oh my.....
[22:31:47] Gordo Kin: We have some wierd people down here
[22:32:01] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: At some point,
[22:32:09] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I want to try fortifying my are
[22:32:11] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: /looc area
[22:32:27] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: At least have some barricades to prevent the... shit from leaking in.
[22:32:32] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Whatever it is...
[22:32:33] Gordo Kin: Wonderful to hear, hopefully I can be of a assistance with this fortifying 
[22:33:14] Client "the talking duck" connected.
[22:33:18] Gordo Kin: Hm......that syringe might be of use....
[22:33:33] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Maybe. I found some newspaper if you want a good read
[22:34:00] Gordo Kin: I'm all good, reading about what people were thinking when the Combine was taking over is the last thing I want on my mind
[22:34:15] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Haha, I think it's even fucking older, but eh.
[22:34:21] Gordo Kin: Impressiv
[22:34:37] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I would love to sanction this entire area off
[22:34:58] Gordo Kin: yeah....but purhaps it could be useful for exploration.
[22:35:06] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Not for a long while
[22:35:19] Gordo Kin: I know that they have a few turrets and a lot of tents ripe for the picking
[22:35:33] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Shit, turrets?
[22:35:35] Gordo Kin: The turrets don't even attack registered civilians
[22:35:36] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I was shot by one once.
[22:35:41] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Wait, really?
[22:36:00] Gordo Kin: It seems like it since I've been in the QZ with a hazmat suit on and they didn't do shit
[22:36:03] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Hope it doesn't detect CID...
[22:36:07] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Because I never got one.
[22:36:17] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Or well, ever had the chance of getting one.
[22:36:27] Gordo Kin: actually....
[22:36:37] Gordo Kin: I know a path into the intrance of QZ
[22:36:46] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Hell, I'm doubtful they only have numbers to my name because of my Anti Civi identity.
[22:36:48] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Hm?
[22:37:01] Gordo Kin: I know a path into the intrance so it isn't a infectious area
[22:37:08] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Huh...
[22:37:10] Gordo Kin: maybe they store suits their?
[22:37:13] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Maybe.
[22:37:21] Gordo Kin: We can grab a few and figure out how to get out of their.
[22:37:28] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Yeah...
[22:37:36] Gordo Kin: Pretty sure they have a window into one of the factories.
[22:37:41] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Hm...
[22:37:45] Gordo Kin: That can be opened in the QZ intrance
[22:37:50] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Maybe see if you can get your buddy to source you one...
[22:37:55] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Do they send civis in there?
[22:38:03] Gordo Kin: Sometimes
[22:38:16] Gordo Kin: Well the Combine love to make us work in the QZ
[22:38:19] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Do they give you the suits? Or just amputate after they're finished?
[22:38:25] Gordo Kin: They give us suits
[22:38:37] Gordo Kin: If the suits are broken in any way they amputate
[22:38:44] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Right. If you feel like you can, try to take two suits. One to give back, one to keep
[22:38:57] Gordo Kin: I've seen a OTA kill himself because of a suit breach
[22:38:59] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: We truly only need one to go exploring and benefit the both of us.
[22:39:01] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Damn...
[22:39:06] Gordo Kin: Yeah
[22:39:30] Gordo Kin: I'm happy to volunteer....that place is scary but fasinating in a way

[22:39:50] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I bet my non-existant tokens they'll ignore gunshots in the QZ
[22:40:00] Gordo Kin: Most likely they'll think its the turret
[22:40:05] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Also... the fuck do tokens look like? I've never seen em, at least I think.
