[12:39:49] Merissa Myers: "Red and not yellow or green."
[12:40:28] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: I would hope. You don't know the letter and rhesus factor?

[12:44:18] Merissa Myers: "Specifically. War related."
[12:44:38] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: You'd be surprised how many people admit that.,
[12:44:45] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Alright.
[12:45:02] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: That should be it. I've got a lot of information for you.

[12:46:47] Merissa Myers: .// I was *almost* in the military last week

[12:47:09] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: .//i need to ask, feel free to tell while i type all this stuff out for you
[12:47:25] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: We've got air vents all aroound the city, in each apartment and in various other places. They look like the device to your left between these two windows.
[12:47:53] Merissa Myers: .// Oh I just felt worthless and skillless and thought maybe if I joined the military I could turn my life around. Nothing special, pretty typical really.
[12:48:03] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: .//omg i'm sorry to hear!!!
[12:48:22] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: They spit out clean air and help preserve your filters. You can remove your suit in their vicinity.
[12:48:31] Merissa Myers: .// Had a long talk with my girlfriend who was in the navy.
[12:48:54] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: You'll need to keep getting filters over time, but there are many ways to make tokens.
[12:49:01] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: .//the air vents always have a tooltip on them when you hover over them
[12:49:25] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: You can donate blood at machines like the one behind you.
[12:49:27] Merissa Myers: "Speaking of tokens, I was curious about.. Civil Authority application."
[12:49:43] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Yeah, hold on. Questions at the end, I'm trying to get this out from memory.
[12:49:53] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: 10 tokens for your blood, you can donate once every 36 hours.
[12:50:43] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: We're in the middle of a resin buyback, so if you find any pucks of blueish black metal, you can turn it in to a machine at the ration distrbiution terminal in exchange for tokens.
[12:50:53] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: I'm missing something.
[12:51:16] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Anyways. 
[12:51:31] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Combine Civil Authority, you need 10 LP, you can get more LP by doing various loyalist tasks, as you can imagine.
[12:52:01] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Work desk tasks are worth 1 each, but giving medical aid to a CCA unit, saving a life, reporting in progress crimes, turning in contraband, all get you more.
[12:52:08] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Saving the life of a CCA unit, that is./
[12:52:27] Merissa Myers: Most of the lifesaving I know is with a firearm, but we'll see what I can do.
[12:52:42] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: You'd be surprised how many stories we have of a citizen taking a bullet for someone.
[12:52:48] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: .//me when lying IC
[12:52:57] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Let me clarify you only receive LP for reporting crimes you are not the victim of. You don't get LP for telling a CCA unit that someone attempted to murder you.
[12:53:05] Merissa Myers: Already had a few bullets.
[12:53:51] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: different CWU branches require different amounts of LP. you don't have to be in the CWU to make tokens.
[12:54:11] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: So if you want to sell non-contraband to fellow citizens, that won't be restricted.
[12:54:36] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Any questions?
[12:54:53] Merissa Myers: None yet.
[12:55:00] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: That's all I have for you at the moment.
[12:55:07] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: .//void the jump, i have fat fingers
[12:55:09] Merissa Myers: Awesome sauce
[12:55:13] Merissa Myers: I am not saying that again.
[12:55:32] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: /me places the now room temperature CID card on the counter and slides it forward.
[12:55:59] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Despite what people would say, you can ask us questions at any time given we aren't busy.
[12:56:06] Merissa Myers: Mhm.
[12:56:13] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: You're free to go if you like. Stay out of trouble.
