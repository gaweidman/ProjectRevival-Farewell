[20:32:24] Charles J. Buckley: Believe what you want, but I have no reaosn to lie.
[20:32:29] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Literally every-fucking-thing in the QZ.
[20:32:36] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.36307: Then it's "the citizen"?
[20:32:38] Gordo Kin: The QZ ITSELF is dangerous
[20:32:40] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Even the Combine are afraid of whatever is in there.
[20:32:41] Charles J. Buckley: I was going to offer you sanctuary nearby with anotehr person, but you threatened to bash my skull in.

[20:33:17] Gordo Kin: because we don't want to die from fucking brown air going into our lungs, if the headcrabs and zombies don't get us first

[20:33:43] Charles J. Buckley: There is not brown air, unless you go near the smog pits. Which I avoid- because you know. It's toxic.
[20:33:49] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: Do you have your coupon?
[20:34:00] Gordo Kin: A OTA unit killed himself just because his suit got breached while in the QZ and said he was going to kill himself so he doesn't get infected.
[20:34:10] Charles J. Buckley: With?
[20:34:12] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I don't believe that. I opened the door to there for a split second, only to be met with that fucking dust.

[20:34:14] tom the citizen: no

[20:34:19] Gordo Kin: You heard me
[20:34:25] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: You don't have your relocation coupon
[20:34:27] Charles J. Buckley: No, you're being vague.

[20:34:30] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: // Tom, can you give me a proper name?
[20:34:32] Charles J. Buckley: It adds to your creepy factor, so.

[20:34:38] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: // apparently
[20:34:42] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.36307: /radio He doesn't have a coupon?

[20:34:48] Charles J. Buckley: What was he infected with? Now your a question dodger.
[20:34:54] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: /radio 10-91 does not have a relocation coupon.
[20:34:55] Gordo Kin: He never elaborated
[20:35:03] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: /radio Or, claims to not have one.
[20:35:09] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: If a OTA kills themselves, it's something bad.
[20:35:18] Gordo Kin: Only said he doesn't want to get infected and left me and another civvie to die in the QZ
[20:35:24] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: /toggleraise
[20:35:33] tom the citizen: nooooo
[20:35:34] Charles J. Buckley: So why were you talking to a OTA?

[20:35:45] Charles J. Buckley: /me becomes more wary of the man, looking to the crowbar, then him.
[20:35:51] Charles J. Buckley: Workcycle?

[20:36:18] Charles J. Buckley: /me looks between the two.
[20:36:20] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: But I guess they do it with the extra spice that is the QZ.
[20:36:24] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.36307: .// do you resist
[20:36:25] tom the citizen: im good citizen
[20:36:27] Charles J. Buckley: I haven't beenin the city, so. You lost me there.
[20:36:36] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.36307: .// im gonna take that as a no
[20:36:38] Gordo Kin: And it was important enough for a OTA unit in full hazmat gear to come and force us to do it
[20:36:47] Charles J. Buckley: Did you guys take anything from the OTA? Well. Clearly not.
[20:36:52] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.36307: /me searches the man for the coupon
[20:36:54] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.36307: /charsearch

[20:37:04] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: Great.
[20:37:07] Gordo Kin: My partner here never knew I existed once this happened
[20:37:08] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: Citizen, move up to the window.
[20:37:11] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: Cut his ties, 363.
[20:37:12] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I never saw it for myself, but I wouldn't of dared to take anything from the QZ.
[20:37:18] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.36307: /me cuts the ties
[20:37:22] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.36307: go
[20:37:28] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: Hand me his coupon
[20:37:32] Charles J. Buckley: Right, so you have this insane fear of the QZ. Almost psychotic.
[20:37:38] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: /me grips the coupon, moving over to the machine
[20:37:41] Gordo Kin: It's normal honestly
[20:37:44] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Almost everyone does. 
[20:37:53] Charles J. Buckley: /me looks to his hands, then him. "No. It isn't."
[20:37:59] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: /me inserts the citizen's relocation coupon into the machine. It soon prints out a brand new, black coloured card.
[20:38:02] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Flesh trees and brown dust that come from some fucking alien thing is enough to make a grown man panic.
[20:38:19] Charles J. Buckley: Yes, Lovecraft Eldritch Weird Fiction come true.
[20:38:25] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: Citizen, pick up your ID
[20:38:26] Charles J. Buckley: But there isn't some dust infection that kills people.
[20:38:32] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: Now,
[20:38:36] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: I'm going to ask you a few questions
[20:38:38] Gordo Kin: And having aliens, zombies Et-cetera come at you in that setting is even worse
[20:38:41] tom the citizen: thank you
[20:38:45] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I'm doubtful of that. 
[20:38:48] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: First, what is your Date of Birth?
[20:38:50] Charles J. Buckley: I mean Zombies are easy to maneuver.
[20:38:53] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: .// it's 2001 for reference
[20:39:04] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: .// 21 is the miminum until amputation
[20:39:05] Charles J. Buckley: The headcrabs are parasites- yes. But... Yeah.
[20:39:09] Charles J. Buckley: That's it about them.
[20:39:18] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: If the QZ didn't scare the combine, I doubt it would still exist.
[20:39:24] tom the citizen: 1999
[20:39:25] Gordo Kin: I've seen what that place has to offer.....it has plenty of fast zombies and I've seen a infected OTA before
[20:39:31] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: 1999?
[20:39:31] Charles J. Buckley: So have I.
[20:39:36] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: But something is... making them worry. 
[20:39:36] Charles J. Buckley: But guess what they had in common.
[20:39:41] Charles J. Buckley: They all head crabs on them.
[20:39:47] tom the citizen: is my year and my age is 19
[20:39:51] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: ARe you trying to be funny?
[20:39:55] Charles J. Buckley: If they wre really worried they would bomb it, you know that right?
[20:39:56] Gordo Kin: What my partner has said, if they wanted to they would have destroyed it by now but they haven't
[20:39:59] tom the citizen: no?
[20:40:01] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Ugh, you don't understand, do you? The threat of the QZ is something we cannot see.
[20:40:03] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: hm
[20:40:10] Gordo Kin: It is a infection you dimwit
[20:40:12] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: It's something that is microscopic.
[20:40:16] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: 363
[20:40:18] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.36307: He's either 10-103M or an ass.
[20:40:18] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: Come here.
[20:40:20] Charles J. Buckley: No, the threa tis non exsistent. Let's think about it forma  different angle.
[20:40:24] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: A infection can deal a lot more damage than a Parasitic. 
[20:40:26] Gordo Kin: Something that if it is blown up would most likely spread faster
[20:40:36] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I can spread it to friends, family, Civil Protection, etc etc.
[20:40:45] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: Suspect is clearly 10-103M, giving false information to a police officer
[20:40:53] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: Constant running
[20:40:55] Gordo Kin: .// Covid 19 but in the HL universe be like
[20:40:58] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.36307: yep
[20:40:58] tom the citizen: hi
[20:40:59] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: how old are you?
[20:40:59] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: As is 19
[20:41:07] Charles J. Buckley: The Combine don't destroy things they want, so they study it. Iv'e seen OTA doing that before. They want citizens and rebels out? Instead of putting a garrison, they put a fake virus to scare people away.
[20:41:17] tom the citizen: why 
[20:41:21] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.36307: We're thinking 10-103M
[20:41:21] Charles J. Buckley: They send in some people, and tell a Overwatch to kill themselves to sell it even more.
[20:41:26] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: are you questioning my orders, citizen?
[20:41:29] Charles J. Buckley: Now you have a fool proof concept of defense.
[20:41:35] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: judge
[20:41:35] tom the citizen: no im not
[20:41:40] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: what
[20:41:47] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Fake virus? Bullshit. If the Combine made a fake virus, it's a real virus knowing them.
[20:41:54] Charles J. Buckley: If they really wanted it gone. They have the WORLD'S resources plus their own alien technology to completely annaliate it.
[20:41:59] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: Suspect is a possible 10-103M, claims to be 19 years of age, however the Date of Birth he has given does not correlate with this.
[20:42:01] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: answer the question
[20:42:03] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: .// doesn't match up*
[20:42:11] Gordo Kin: Bold of you too assume that you CAN deal with it
[20:42:21] Gordo Kin: Even the Combine have their limits
[20:42:23] tom the citizen: oof
[20:42:31] Charles J. Buckley: Orbitbal bombardment, glassing, flamethrowers, mortars.
[20:42:44] Charles J. Buckley: Simple cleanings with aero-fluids.
[20:42:53] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: wall
[20:42:56] Charles J. Buckley: Isn't there a Infestatio Control unit in City 17 too?
[20:43:02] Charles J. Buckley: You have their unfiform on right now.
[20:43:04] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: /me Attempts to restrain the citizen/suspect via Ziptie by placing one on their wrists. (Do you resist?)
[20:43:08] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Bombing would make it would... in all honesty.
[20:43:14] Charles J. Buckley: make it what?
[20:43:20] tom the citizen: no
[20:43:27] Gordo Kin: It would spread more considering blowing it up just spreads it more
[20:43:27] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: That dust would potentially spread into the air. Envelop the city if they tried bombing it.
[20:43:33] tom the citizen: just let me goooooo
[20:43:33] Gordo Kin: Exactly
[20:43:38] Charles J. Buckley: The QZ is topside.
[20:43:40] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: be quiet
[20:43:42] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Hell, I just say dust. It's some fucking organism.
[20:43:47] tom the citizen: reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[20:43:48] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: /me begins dragging the man.
[20:43:49] Charles J. Buckley: WHy wouldn't particulates get caught in the wind and carried into the city?
[20:43:54] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: move
[20:43:58] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: It's walled off.
[20:44:02] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: move it
[20:44:03] Charles J. Buckley: No it isn't.
[20:44:10] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: Follow the officer
[20:44:19] Gordo Kin: Are you dumb?
[20:44:21] Charles J. Buckley: It's right behind their HQ, with low buildings around it.
[20:44:23] Gordo Kin: I've seen it
[20:44:26] Charles J. Buckley: The walls are Combine gates.
[20:44:33] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: And secondly, that also means that the dust itself is heavy.
[20:44:33] Charles J. Buckley: I tohught you said you never went up there?
[20:44:34] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: /me forcefully sits the man down.
[20:44:35] tom the citizen: whyyyyyy
[20:44:46] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: /pm union come watch through the window
[20:44:55] Gordo Kin: He said he has but right as he saw the dust he bolted
[20:45:00] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: /me tightens the restraints on the man.
[20:45:04] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: what is your age?
[20:45:09] Charles J. Buckley: He opened the door a bit, he said.
[20:45:13] Charles J. Buckley: The doors to the metro.
[20:45:15] tom the citizen: 19
[20:45:22] Charles J. Buckley: /me looks directly at the man when he says this, after calling him out.
[20:45:25] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Yes. It's clearly completely walled off. 
[20:45:27] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: interesting
[20:45:30] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: date of birth?
[20:45:30] Charles J. Buckley: But. It isn't.
[20:45:42] Charles J. Buckley: Riddle me this, both of you.
[20:45:42] tom the citizen: 1980
[20:45:48] Charles J. Buckley: Have you SEEN one of these dusted infected?
[20:45:58] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: so you are not 19
[20:45:58] Gordo Kin: I have
[20:46:03] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: the year is 2001
[20:46:04] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: No, but I've heard rumors of... things topside happening.
[20:46:11] tom the citizen: ......
[20:46:16] Charles J. Buckley: I don't believe you.
[20:46:18] Gordo Kin: I've seen some shit that you couldn't possibly imagine.
[20:46:25] Charles J. Buckley: If you did, that would have said that first.
[20:46:30] Charles J. Buckley: Before I even said anything.
[20:46:37] tom the citizen: im what age you want me to be
[20:46:42] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: You consider that he might want to forget it?
[20:46:54] Charles J. Buckley: Usually traumatic things are core memories, whether you try to forget or not.
[20:46:59] Charles J. Buckley: He would have mentioned it.
[20:47:03] Gordo Kin: And if you don't remember my good sir
[20:47:04] Charles J. Buckley: You both... Are crazy.
[20:47:20] tom the citizen: why cant you let me leave
[20:47:25] Charles J. Buckley: Iv'e been in there one or two days. ANd I have never once seen this.
[20:47:31] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Whatever. In my case, I might be crazy, but crazy has apparently kept me alive.
[20:47:43] Charles J. Buckley: Actually, no it hasn't.
[20:47:45] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: are you 19 or are you 21?
[20:47:52] Gordo Kin: A high up CCA officer went onto the city camera and warned us that if we go their it is immediate amputation
[20:47:54] Charles J. Buckley: Avidly avoiding people, beliving superstition, and threats keep you alive.
[20:48:02] Gordo Kin: Not just prison time
[20:48:05] Charles J. Buckley: Yes because it's outside the city. They want you inside.
[20:48:12] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: I've never been to prision before.
[20:48:18] Charles J. Buckley: If you're outside the city it's instant death.
[20:48:20] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: Citizen, answer all of the questions given to you by the officer truthfully, or risk recieving civil judgement.
[20:48:20] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Nor any CCA related ones.
[20:48:27] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: /toggleraise
[20:48:28] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: Debatable.
[20:48:34] Gordo Kin: No "Charles" it isn't instant death
[20:48:45] tom the citizen: 21 my  final answer plz let me leave
[20:48:50] Charles J. Buckley: Emphasizing my name like I lied to you is retarded.
[20:48:53] Gordo Kin: They atleast take you to prison and give you a low LP score
[20:48:58] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: not yet
[20:48:59] Gordo Kin: Not instant death
