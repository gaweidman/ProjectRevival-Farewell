[11:29:48] Chloe Cullen: .// Just tell me what to go over
[11:29:58] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .// the basics of rp, description making, the basic lore.
[11:30:06] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .//also shit like the ooc and looc commands
[11:30:26] Chloe Cullen: .// Right so first step. LOOC is for local chat. You can use .// in the bar to do it
[11:30:32] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .// just basic stuff so they dont get banned.
[11:30:35] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: Alright
[11:30:37] Chloe Cullen: .// doing // will make it global.
[11:30:43] jimity: /looc like this?
[11:30:46] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .//yeah good
[11:30:48] Chloe Cullen: .// Yes!
[11:31:05] jimity: /looc so ooc is global out of character chat?
[11:31:08] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .//so when your not talking in character, like when you are not talking as your character use .//
[11:31:14] Chloe Cullen: .// Correct!
[11:31:27] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .// like if you need to ask "hey how do i do insert ooc task here" 
[11:31:39] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .// ask in looc and you should get some decent help.
[11:31:48] jimity: /looc thanks
[11:32:13] Chloe Cullen: .// As for your description, it varies how you want to go. I use rather basic descriptions over the heavily remarkable to allow more imagination of what I look like. 
[11:32:25] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .// alright, for descriptions you really just have to describe what you first notice about your character
[11:32:40] jimity: /looc alright
[11:32:40] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .// like how youd describe someone to the cops
[11:32:41] Chloe Cullen: .// Chloe has facial scarring, which is an immediate noticable factor.
[11:32:52] Chloe Cullen: .// Severe burn scars.
[11:33:04] jimity: /looc im gonna get to doing that
[11:33:12] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .// so stuff like, brown hair, brown eyes, standing somewhere between 5'10 and 6'0, gang tattoos, spanish accent
[11:33:14] Chloe Cullen: .// what was the other thing, uhhh.
[11:33:16] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .//stuff like that
[11:33:25] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .// just basic lore and rp customs 
[11:33:31] Chloe Cullen: .// Basic lore. Are you familiar with Half Life?
[11:33:40] jimity: /looc yeah
[11:33:57] Death Razor<STEAM_0:1:66880501> changed their name to Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez
[11:33:57] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .// also, heres our forums. it contains most of the info about the server youll need
[11:33:59] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .// https://projectrevival.xyz/forum/
[11:34:06] Chloe Cullen: .// We don't differ much. Our year is... 2006 I believe. Three years after the Combine invasion in 2003.
[11:34:22] Chloe Cullen: .// I'm sure everything else is the same. The portal storms, the resonance cascade..
[11:34:47] Chloe Cullen: .// But, alas, this is beta! BETA IS DIFFERENT AND BETTER
[11:34:50] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .// just basic hl beta lore.
[11:35:01] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .// yeah, more grim and deppressing.
[11:35:07] Chloe Cullen: .// Children exist! They are enslaved. ANybody under 18 is a slave.
[11:35:11] jimity: /looc i know a tad from beta i'll look into it after this
[11:35:28] Chloe Cullen: .// More synths and aliens are around! They are commonplace due to the presence of the Combine and the portal storms.
[11:35:39] jimity: /looc ok ok ok
[11:35:42] Chloe Cullen: .// Earth's atmosphere has been altered. It is hardly survivable now.
[11:36:00] jimity: /looc thats why we have filters okay.
[11:36:14] Chloe Cullen: .// It's more like Xen's atmosphere I believe. Plus the Combine have been harvesting resources like water.
[11:36:42] Chloe Cullen: .// The reason why we still live is Breen I presume. The Combine are still seen as the good guys by many due to them saving us from the Portal Storms. 
[11:36:59] Chloe Cullen: .// Most believe them to be evil, though evil doesn't really suit a race that spans entire universes.
[11:37:12] Chloe Cullen: .// many, not mostr
[11:37:15] jimity: /looc so standered combine things got it.
[11:37:44] Chloe Cullen: .// Yeah basically. The brutality is excusable. It's necessary to survive. Others believe we don't need the Combine. But the reality is we don't have a choice.
[11:37:58] jimity: /looc huh
[11:38:12] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .// they ruined everything and now we need them to survive.
[11:38:24] Chloe Cullen: .// /Xen/ ruined everything. Humans ruined it.
[11:38:51] Chloe Cullen: .// Humans opened the portals and destroyed Earth. Combine put a stop to it and made the cities. A safe haven. It's easy to see how people like them.
[11:39:09] jimity: /looc alrighty
[11:39:17] jimity: /looc thanks for the lore lesson
[11:39:23] Chloe Cullen: .// At the same time they're a brutal military dictatorship
[11:39:44] Chloe Cullen: .// They saved humanity at a cost. 
[11:39:45] Client "[AU] AtlasUpriser[LEC]" connected.
[11:39:56] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .// like an abusive relationship, you love them when their nice and you hate them when their not.
[11:40:22] Chloe Cullen: .// That cost was humanity, so we lost it either way. Just this way we continue to exist somewhat.
[11:40:51] jimity: /looc untill some maniac with a crowbar saves the day
[11:40:54] Chloe Cullen: .// Basically think 
[11:41:05] Chloe Cullen: .// If Nazi Germany was during the industrial revolution.
[11:41:12] Chloe Cullen: .// And they also had advanced future tech
[11:41:26] Chloe Cullen: .// that basically sums up Beta aesthetic.
[11:41:41] jimity: /looc so modern tech in the medieval ages
[11:42:01] Chloe Cullen: .// More like advanced super tech during the early 1900s and late 1800s
[11:42:21] jimity: /looc okay so what do the stat bars do i see 3 of them
[11:42:26] Chloe Cullen: .// There's smog, there's streets full of filth, hospitals filled with the sick..
[11:42:29] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .// pretty much bringing an ak47 to a linr battle
[11:42:48] Chloe Cullen: .// Crime is commonplace, but the brutality of the Combine sees it ended quickly.
[11:43:03] Chloe Cullen: .// Propaganda is as normal is not breathing the air.
[11:43:22] jimity: /looc we okay to move on
[11:43:36] Chloe Cullen: .// Yeah that covers it
[11:44:00] jimity: /looc i want to know what the 3 bars in the top left of my screen do because i know the red is health since i took damage.
[11:44:12] Chloe Cullen: .// Hey Cheese, send my regards to Matt. I like being helpful! :D
[11:44:20] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .// green is food, blue is thirst
[11:44:24] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .// of course.
[11:44:28] Chloe Cullen: .// yellow is stamina!
[11:44:34] Chloe Cullen: .// It only shows up when you sp-
[11:44:37] Chloe Cullen: .// sprint.
[11:44:43] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .// forgot about stamina.
[11:44:51] jimity: /looc how do i get food and water
[11:45:03] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .// ration cycles and the local shops
[11:45:06] Chloe Cullen: .// Ration times which really should be a machine instead imo
[11:45:19] Chloe Cullen: .// I've never seen a cycle yet but I was also just homeless for three days
[11:45:44] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .// most of the time i just buy 800 tokens worth of food and dump it around the city. along with filters so
[11:45:48] jimity: /looc okay so just makesure i don't die and be apart of the city atmopshere?
[11:45:50] Chloe Cullen: .// which is fun btw, I recommend it. Really gives you a new outlook.
[11:46:07] Chloe Cullen: .// Oh yes! I forgot
[11:46:15] Chloe Cullen: .// There's loot around the city. The resin you can sell.
[11:46:47] jimity: /looc okay so keep a watch out for resin, got it.
[11:47:07] Chloe Cullen: .// The other stuff you can buy and sell from me once I have a store which is WHY I CAME DOWN HERE
[11:47:30] jimity: /looc Okay so find stuff for you got it.
[11:47:47] Chloe Cullen: .// Yup. Is that all, mister officerino?
[11:48:00] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .// rp customs
[11:48:01] Chloe Cullen: .// I need to find other boy

[12:51:19] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: I forgot about cats
[12:51:29] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: I'm a dog person myself.
[12:51:29] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Other than Geneva, but it's become the top 3 cities to live in
[12:51:40] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Hell, if we had police hounds, I would be a *happy* man.
[12:51:41] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: City 24 is the hotbed for quality of life almost.
[12:51:43] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .// gonna actually grab my cat, shes been big pimpin alone all day
[12:51:46] Chloe Cullen: Most cities never lasted the portal storms, so...

[12:51:53] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: .// my dogs been getting all the attention
[12:51:55] Chloe Cullen: Plus when I left most of Berlin was still on fire.
[12:52:10] Chloe Cullen: Maybe that post-World War II construction helped stop that.
[12:52:33] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: You should see City 24, they made it into a loyalist heaven
[12:52:45] Feng Yi 'Eric' Hseuh: I heard so, City 24 is pretty.

[12:53:02] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Definitely nicer quality of living
[12:53:10] Feng Yi 'Eric' Hseuh: I spoke to CWU friends in last city, and they had gone to City 24 for work. They said it is the best city.
[12:53:10] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: Could use pets as a way to bribe Civilians with loyalty.
[12:53:16] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: Your good enough you get a little kitten.
[12:53:20] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Shit, that's a good idea.
[12:53:23] Chloe Cullen: If you aren't CWU, sure.
[12:53:26] Chloe Cullen: It still has slums.
[12:53:45] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: But minimal
[12:53:46] Chloe Cullen: Loyalists are the only ones who can eat and live in the main square.
[12:53:56] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: I may have to take credit for that idea, guy.
[12:54:15] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: As long as i can have my dog again, Im a happy man.

[12:54:59] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: He ran away durin the War, Never saw him again.
[12:55:01] Chloe Cullen: Forgot what trees looked like.
[12:55:10] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Damn.
[12:55:10] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: The medical ward there was amazing
[12:55:13] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Hope he's doing alright.
[12:55:13] Chloe Cullen: But hey. Some of the kids were nice.
[12:55:20] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Better offices and laboratories
[12:55:23] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: You'd be surprised, a tough dog like a pitbull could probably survive in the wild.
[12:55:30] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: Doubt it, LA Is a wasteland.
[12:55:38] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Oh, LA.
[12:55:40] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Hmph

[12:56:06] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Far fetched it sounds but, you never know.
[12:56:07] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Well.
[12:56:13] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: He sounds like he was a good boy.
[12:56:17] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: I'm more of a german shepherd person.
[12:56:35] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: A big, black shepherd.
[12:56:36] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: America is the source of the bad air, That dog couldnt survive 2 weeks in something like that. Bums me out a lot.
[12:56:48] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: I'd like to go back there someday, see how it all comes out.
[12:56:49] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: You sure it is?
[12:56:55] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: Mhm, New Mexico.

[12:57:11] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: I figured that's where it was from.
[12:57:12] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: I hear thats where the first portal storms opened up.
[12:57:22] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: Considering thats where every alien sighting is

[13:50:01] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.10852: So your friend met him. Your friend met him how?

[13:53:21] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i3.10852: And you pushed him further how?
[13:53:45] Merissa Myers: I straight up asked if he had rebel connections. He answered rather vaguely with 'not quite'.

[20:21:16] Jim Bostello: I have done things your little Russian brain cannot comprehend.
[20:21:25] Ethan King: The fuck?
[20:21:31] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Well if the city is lost I wouldn't be surprised if it changed..
[20:21:38] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.23710<STEAM_0:0:193599766> changed their name to Paul-Henri Cartier
[20:21:38] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Don't get hopeful yet.
[20:21:40] Drake Salvador: Three openings. In front, left, and right.
[20:21:41] Ethan King: The fuck?
[20:21:45] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: If you're talking about rebellions you're not the first
[20:21:46] Drake Salvador: We should keep moving before they catch on to us.
[20:21:52] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: At least here
[20:21:56] Ethan King: Sarge?
[20:21:59] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: The antlions? They're dumb as a bag of bricks.
[20:21:59] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: Yeah?
[20:22:05] Ethan King: He's one of us.
[20:22:05] Drake Salvador: Yet when one spots us.
[20:22:05] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: You know this dipshit?
[20:22:09] 1LT Samuel Brody: Can't think worth a damn
[20:22:14] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: *If*.
[20:22:14] Ethan King: A rebel warlord I knew in the past.
[20:22:16] Jim Bostello: Who else been here the?
[20:22:21] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: *If* one spots us.
[20:22:21] Ethan King: He'll be a great aid to us.
[20:22:22] Jim Bostello: .// then*
[20:22:24] Paul-Henri Cartier: /r Who the fuck spilled the shit bucket?
[20:22:25] 1LT Samuel Brody: can communicate with each other real well though
[20:22:30] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: this is true
[20:22:31] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: They're a hivemind
[20:22:31] Jim Bostello: /me would lower his smg, staring down to the man in green.
[20:22:35] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Of sorts.
[20:22:37] Drake Salvador: Well I'd say that's a large opening to spot us there.
[20:22:47] Ethan King: /radio Clean that up
[20:22:49] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: They are a literal hivemind in the sense that they live in hives and also act like ants or bees
[20:22:57] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: Ugh, I've been trying to get out of that trash hole they call a city for a bit
[20:23:04] 1LT Samuel Brody: or a combination of both
[20:23:08] Ethan King: Alright, lets head back to the base.
[20:23:09] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Because when one screeches..the pack comes forth.
[20:23:10] Drake Salvador: Bee-ants.
[20:23:11] Jim Bostello: You didn't even answer my question.
[20:23:14] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: Got caught up in the infestation or whatever is going on
[20:23:20] Ethan King: We'll talk at the base
[20:23:22] Jim Bostello: Right.
[20:23:34] 1LT Samuel Brody: i can see why we chose the name Antlion instead
[20:23:48] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Deadly pack if you're alone
[20:23:49] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Okay, this here says the city is doing... poorly.
[20:23:50] 1LT Samuel Brody: instead of Ant-bees or Bee-lions
[20:23:54] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: There are...
[20:23:55] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: What the hell?
[20:24:00] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Vortigaunts working *with* the antlions.
[20:24:05] Ethan King: No, no, no.
[20:24:08] 1LT Samuel Brody: thats odd
[20:24:12] 1LT Samuel Brody: even for us
[20:24:13] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Enemy of my enemy is my friend.
[20:24:16] Jim Bostello: Fuckin' lord.
[20:24:19] Jim Bostello: Swarms of them.
[20:24:21] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Guess they learned it
[20:24:22] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: You mean the friend of my enemy is my enemy?
[20:24:25] Jim Bostello: Out of nowhere, of course.
[20:24:29] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Oh, I get what you're saying.
[20:24:31] Preobrazhensky Bogolepov: Ahhh you guys are no fun
[20:24:40] Ethan King: We need to get some plan.
[20:24:47] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: The saying is what I originally said.
[20:25:03] Ethan King: /radio Paul, do we have any grenades or explosives?
[20:25:03] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: No, I get that. I was trying to correct- Nevermind, it's not worth explaining.
[20:25:07] Drake Salvador: Are we missing someone?
[20:25:12] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: .//GRID flagged down
[20:25:14] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: So we're fucked, the city is *possibly* fucked, and now we're stuck here potentially
[20:25:15] Drake Salvador: .// Ah
[20:25:32] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: I'm not going to stay in here with a bunch of assholes who smell like sewage, so we better not be.
[20:25:36] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: We're waiting on orders.

[20:26:11] Ethan King: /reply Yep
[20:26:14] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Correct.
[20:26:20] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: For now, you need *something*.
[20:26:21] Ethan King: /radio It would appear we have a small nest of Antlions in our way.
[20:26:22] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: so, just let me have..
[20:26:23] Paul-Henri Cartier: /r You have guns, don't you?

[20:27:14] Ethan King: /radio That is second priority now, move it so we can actually get to our base.
[20:27:15] Paul-Henri Cartier: /R Human beings need oxygen to live.
[20:27:16] Drake Salvador: I don't like it.

[20:29:05] Drake Salvador: Well what's smart survival between four ragtag people compared to a multi-million strong bug race.
[20:29:05] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: I was able to find these.

[20:29:27] Ethan King: So, about that air vent?
[20:29:29] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: Feel free to use them as weapons in case shit goes down.
[20:29:37] Ethan King: Could you tell me what needed maintenance on it?
[20:29:43] Paul-Henri Cartier: The air intake valve needed to be replaced.
[20:29:45] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: take whatever you like
[20:29:48] Drake Salvador: /me takes the pickaxe, getting a feel for the weight. "Better than nothing, even if it's not a firearm."
[20:30:01] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023: /y If I gave you a firearm we'd both be put to death.
[20:30:01] Ethan King: Really, and that was prioritized over assisting us with literally anything?
[20:30:05] Ethan King: I see
[20:30:10] Paul-Henri Cartier: well you look fine to me.
[20:30:19] Ethan King: Sarge, what did you learn while in the city?
[20:30:37] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.51023<STEAM_0:1:53097688> changed their name to Freluci

[20:31:08] Paul-Henri Cartier: dispatch broke?
[20:31:09] Ethan King: Glad this city never changes.
[20:31:14] Ethan King: Uh....
[20:31:18] Drake Salvador: I don't know where he went.
[20:31:18] Freluci: I have come to speak to you all.
[20:31:20] Ethan King: It would appear the Vort is back.
[20:31:22] Jim Bostello: Right next to me, again.,
[20:31:24] Paul-Henri Cartier: at least it wasn't replaced with an old gu-
[20:31:34] Jim Bostello: Ethan, I need to talk to you after this.
[20:31:45] 1LT Samuel Brody: you two, stay here
[20:31:46] Jim Bostello: You need to do some explaining, I do too.

[20:32:16] Freluci: But I am not able to do everything.
[20:32:28] Drake Salvador: /w They hate every religion. I wasn't a religious person anyway.
[20:32:30] 1LT Samuel Brody: yeah I have no idea

[20:33:01] 1LT Samuel Brody: he can take car of himself
[20:33:07] Jim Bostello: I didn't get sent here for nothing, what is it?

[20:33:13] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Exactly
[20:33:17] Ethan King: Same here, what do you need?
[20:33:25] 1LT Samuel Brody: i know him, and from experience he will show back up
[20:33:34] 1LT Samuel Brody: guarentee it
[20:33:44] Drake Salvador: Before, during, or after the antlions show up?
[20:33:45] Freluci: You, Bostello, have been sent differently than you think. He works mysteriously, but more predictable than you may think.
[20:33:52] Freluci: In exchange, I will take care of your Hunter problem.
[20:34:05] Freluci: Excuse me.
[20:34:14] 1LT Samuel Brody: i saw him in the wastelands, where everything is way more dangerous, he'll be fine
[20:34:16] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: I can't take the word of a man that is part of a group that made a massacre, last time I checked
[20:34:28] 1LT Samuel Brody: what?
[20:34:29] Jim Bostello: Wait, so does that mean he needs me?

[22:12:40] Freluci: The shell beach entrance.
[22:12:45] Freluci: They will send units to act as scouts.
[22:12:52] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Who knows if he's taking us to another city or to be killed.
[22:12:56] Drake Salvador: Right, let's search the rest of the rooms for supplies then.
[22:12:58] Freluci: They will ensure people like you are dead and pose no threat.
[22:13:11] Ethan King: They've got another thing coming.
[22:13:15] Areth  Martin: No clue what exactly what items, i suppose anything.

[22:35:35] Ethan King: We are living the lives of soldiers now.

[22:39:51] Drake Salvador: I'm not willing to waste alcohol like that.
[22:39:54] Jim Bostello: That would be enslavement, in a sense.

[22:40:17] Drake Salvador: Try to nail one. They'll be used as spotting flares.
[22:40:26] Ethan King: Samuel, I hope you're aware that you can't go back after this.

[22:43:18] Drake Salvador: The MP7 is fine.

[22:44:28] Drake Salvador: /me glances at Andrew, before looking down at his MP7. He takes out the magazine and shows it to him. "These pierce armor. If we hit 'em with this and they got any armor on, it tumbles more than a rifle would on a meat target."
