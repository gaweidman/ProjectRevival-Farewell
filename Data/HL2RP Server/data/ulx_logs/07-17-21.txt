[18:23:51] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: /pm 510 It is what it is man honestly, I've told people numerous times I can't go from bottom up anymore. It's like a senior vice president of Company A going to another company because it's a better workplace, but only if he gets the same level he was in
[18:24:04] Burt Bambze: those other items may only represent 1 mole of iron.
[18:24:17] Burt Bambze: which can be deadly in human lungs
[18:24:38] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: /pm 510 When you talk to people who've gone through repeated cycles, it's a burnout to go back up, it's why corporate executives don't leave their companies unless they know they're getting the same equivalent
