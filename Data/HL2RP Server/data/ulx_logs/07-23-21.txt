[20:06:34] Drake Salvador: /me walks over to the counter, leaning on it as he takes off the mask to his suit, pulling said suit down to around his waist. "Yeah." he walks over to the counter and leans on it as he looks around for a menu.
[20:06:42] Drake Salvador: Oxygen, huh?
[20:06:50] Chloe Cullen: It is what we breathe.
[20:07:15] Drake Salvador: Well let's hope that's the only thing they're giving us through them.
[20:07:44] Chloe Cullen: /me scowls. "I don't take that kind of talk at my bar."
[20:07:59] Drake Salvador: What kind of talk? Are you assuming I'm against the Union?
[20:08:24] Chloe Cullen: Just a fair warning.
[20:09:10] Drake Salvador: Lady, I risked my life as a temporary conscript for this city. If you want to keep this business alive, don't assume the worst out of a comment.
[20:09:17] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Drake, enough.
[20:09:24] Drake Salvador: Fine.
[20:09:25] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Not worth the argument
[20:09:40] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: /me puts up his glasses as he continues to read his Bible
[20:09:48] Chloe Cullen: /me perked a brow at this 'Drake'. "Yeah. I wouldn't."
[20:10:02] Drake Salvador: They let you have that now, Razor?
[20:10:20] Chloe Cullen: .// there's invisible buttons over here and I hate it
[20:11:05] Drake Salvador: .// Invisible buttons have made me piss myself before. Trap door in a custom-built map for an old Metro server I was in, dropped open the entire buffer zone between the station and the tunnels.
[20:11:16] Chloe Cullen: Can I get you anything, 'Drake'?
[20:11:17] Drake Salvador: .// It was supposed to be for admins only but they found it.
[20:11:23] Drake Salvador: What do you have?
[20:11:32] Chloe Cullen: Menu is over in the middle of the bar.
[20:11:50] Drake Salvador: /me leans over, glancing through the menu.
[20:12:23] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: /me slides the menu to Drake for better view
[20:12:23] Drake Salvador: It's all non-alcoholic right? With the whole Union approved thing?
[20:13:18] Chloe Cullen: Synthetic alcohol, yup. Union tech is interesting. Tastes the same and I've seen people placebo drunk because they didn't know that.
[20:13:39] Drake Salvador: Right. I'll take a coffee and absinthe.

[20:16:31] Drake Salvador: /w I wouldn't know.
[20:16:58] Drake Salvador: /w So, did they always let you have a Bible?
[20:17:34] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: /w I had it for as long as I remember, when an officer saw it he didn't care it seemed
[20:17:47] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: /w Most don't give a shit, it seems

[20:20:22] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: /w Thing is where can you have a god forsaken fucking church in this place?
[20:20:52] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: /w I'll be forced under their control but it's not much of a change
[20:21:12] Drake Salvador: /w I wouldn't know. Perhaps approach that general store once the owner returns, see if you may set up an area there?
[20:22:26] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: /w Perhaps, don't know if they will approve it though, with the "Workers' Union" being all about themselves
[20:23:23] Drake Salvador: /w That can change. Though... forgiveness will need to be begged sooner or later if that path is taken.
[20:23:49] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: /w Lot of people have sins they need to repent for, Drake. Even the Authority themselves
[20:24:57] Drake Salvador: /w The authority carry the most sin. We must simply live with it until our time comes. I'm sure there's plenty of ways we can make the Worker's Union begin to care more about us.
[20:25:07] Drake Salvador: /w Though you cannot forget, they too are limited by the Union.
[20:25:59] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: /w The Union and Humans themselves are at an endless war, Drake.
[20:26:17] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Only a matter of time until the torch comes along in the name of the Lord.
[20:26:20] Chloe Cullen: I'm back. Hi.
[20:26:20] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: [[ void
[20:26:26] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: /w Only a matter of time until the torch comes along in the name of the Lord.
[20:27:01] Drake Salvador: Welcome back. So, what's your story if I may ask?
[20:27:21] Drake Salvador: /me takes a few large gulps, finishing his mixture of drinks, looking back up at her.
[20:27:22] Chloe Cullen: You're questioning the scars.
[20:27:54] Drake Salvador: Well, yes and no. Scars are I'm sure a big part of the story, but my question's about your life.
[20:28:51] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: /me flips the page again, reading again
[20:30:22] Chloe Cullen: Nothing to it. Raised in New Orleans. Nothing to me. I was a clerk at a bank til portal storms happened. That's where the scars come from. Always wear face protection around bullsquids is what I learned.
[20:30:47] Drake Salvador: Ah, bullsquids... yes. Acid is a bitch. Or whatever it is.
[20:30:50] Chloe Cullen: Now I run my own bar under the protection of the Union. A lot better than that life.
[20:31:11] Drake Salvador: That cannot be argued. Either inside here, or out there with something wanting to chomp on y'ah.
[20:31:40] Chloe Cullen: Hey apparently some dipshits want to be zombie bait.
[20:32:24] Chloe Cullen: Can't argue with the fact the Union can be heavy handed. But it's that or chaos and the outside. I'll take the walls and the cities over constant war and zombies.
[20:33:17] Drake Salvador: Very true. Who knows? Maybe one day the Union will start expanding too. Cleaning out other areas as they gather more resources and build.
[20:33:24] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Remember the Old Testament and the Rapture..
[20:33:34] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: /me says this as he continues to read
[20:34:03] Chloe Cullen: Bit hard with how some of those 'Xennians' are.. but hey..
[20:34:09] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: You'll come to know that God's creations are not to be trifled with.
[20:34:30] Chloe Cullen: What're you on about? Old Testament? Hell, we saw the world end already. Union probably killed god and took his place.
[20:34:52] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: God is never killed Chloe, he's never in physical form.
[20:35:04] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: That is why Jesus was a thing, you see.
[20:35:10] Drake Salvador: .// brb gonna' feed the dogs
[20:35:28] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Before the Romans still believed in Paganism.
[20:36:05] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: The Union and us are..mere creations in the eyes of God.
[20:36:11] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Some distorted more than others
[20:36:18] Chloe Cullen: Well, I saw the world end and didn't see any god there. I saw portals rip through the 'heavens' and unleash creatures from another world that we could not begin to fathom.
[20:36:36] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Some created perhaps by Satan himself
[20:37:08] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: I like to believe these creatures was Satan distorting creatures into his own sick image
[20:37:55] Chloe Cullen: Mmh. I don't think so. They're just animals doing what animals do.
[20:38:07] Chloe Cullen: Eating, defending territory..
[20:38:47] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Our perception of an animal is far different than the Union
[20:39:00] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: We see these new creatures as monsters
[20:39:24] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: But they perhaps were once something far beautiful before distortion or evolution
[20:39:38] Chloe Cullen: Well they are dangerous. Like wolves and tigers and other shit we used to have.
[20:39:57] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: They are still animals nonetheless
[20:40:26] Chloe Cullen: And insects... and whatever barnacles are.
[20:40:26] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: God loves everyone equally, but there are some who wish to undo his making or take over his place
[20:40:36] Chloe Cullen: Barnacles remind me of slugs.
[20:41:48] Chloe Cullen: Honestly if it weren't for antlions the earth would be sort of okay. Well, and the fact that the portal storms destroyed the enviroment.
[20:42:40] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Lovely forests we had
[20:42:55] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Shame what it came to
[20:43:41] Chloe Cullen: Perhaps. Though the xen infestations can be beautiful. Too bad they're harmful to human life.
[20:44:34] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Which is why God make the universe and different worlds

[20:44:59] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: [[ Yep
[20:45:18] Chloe Cullen: I think you mean self-sufficient.
[20:45:40] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: I just use the synonym, always called it that but yes
[20:45:53] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Self-sufficient, self-govern
[20:46:06] Chloe Cullen: I don't think headcrabs had a government.
[20:46:19] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: They had a pack
[20:46:32] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Or went it alone
[20:46:52] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Regardless they were in another ecosystem, one that isn't compatible with ours
[20:47:20] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: But greed and power turns some to do dangerous things like that
[20:48:56] Chloe Cullen: Dunno if that's why the portals opened. Maybe it was humans. Maybe it was whoever was doing the invasion.
[20:49:34] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: We humans have the greed and power that makes some corrupt for things they shouldn't be touching
[20:49:44] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Whoever did so falls under that
[20:50:47] Chloe Cullen: Could've just been humans not knowing what they were messing with.
[20:50:59] Chloe Cullen: We're curious. Can't fault us for that.
[20:51:17] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: I've learned to stray away from that line
[20:51:28] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: [[ brb one moment let me grab a drink
[20:54:05] Chloe Cullen: Maybe. Progress doesn't come without a price sometimes.
[20:54:26] Chloe Cullen: That price is we lose our world. But we gain stability, new technology centuries beyond our own...

[21:00:10] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Because as a priest, and a bishop, your duty is to help those in need.
[21:00:25] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: [[ true story
[21:00:45] Chloe Cullen: I don't recall any gay or women priests. The only thing that stuck out to me was the amount of child molestation.
[21:01:03] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: I didn't mean priests, I meant followers
[21:02:32] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: I've seen homosexual people come to me with a bloody nose because they were beat
[21:02:46] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: I gave them help and in return they see that God loves everyone
[21:02:53] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: [[ Also a true story on that first part

[21:05:23] Chloe Cullen: .// That's good. I'm glad she could find comfort.

[21:07:36] Drake Salvador: The Union's uniforms are killer.
[21:07:39] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: World War Two black and white.
[21:08:20] Chloe Cullen: Yeah, terrorists against Order, structure, and protection. Very black and white to me.
[21:08:38] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: With civilians in the crossfire..
[21:08:48] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Yes..very black and white
[21:09:08] Chloe Cullen: Maybe the terrorists should stop attacking cities, then.
[21:09:36] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: You think people that go to church peacefully are terrorists then, Chloe?
[21:09:37] Drake Salvador: Don't get it wrong, they don't attack the cities. They attack the infrastructure of the Union.
[21:09:43] Drake Salvador: Attacking a city is suicide.
[21:10:05] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: The Union slaughtered my church, so you know Chloe
[21:10:12] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: They killed a child
[21:10:44] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: If you think they're "terrorists" because they wanted to preach the word of God, you need to see that it isn't two sides
[21:10:53] Chloe Cullen: Didn't say it's perfect. It's preferable to the old world.
[21:11:05] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: There are people that just want their lives back to how they saw it, Chloe
[21:11:16] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: /me closes his book, standing up and taking off his glasses
[21:11:16] Drake Salvador: As much as I hate to say it, that will never happen.

[21:11:51] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: Maybe there are people that just want to live their lives without prejudice
[21:12:03] Chloe Cullen: They'll never leave. And they'll never be forced off. Terrorists are just deranged folk who can't let go of the old world and move on.
[21:12:44] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: The day I see persecution stop against peaceful people wanting to live their life, I will gladly leave.
[21:13:07] Chloe Cullen: Leave what?
[21:13:25] Andrew 'Razor' Gonzalez: I'll even have myself arrested if it means that peaceful people can go back to their routine

[21:26:31] Drake Salvador: I suppose so. I heard they get a lot of benefits.
[21:26:34] Chloe Cullen: You said you were a conscript. Not anymore?
[21:26:54] Drake Salvador: Temporary, with the whole city going to shit after the restrictor failed.
[21:27:28] Drake Salvador: We got to Industrial Seventeen, and a unit was given permission from a Divisional and the Conscript captain to deem Razor and me as temporary conscript.
[21:28:22] Drake Salvador: /me taps the medal on his chest a few times. "That's what I got this for. Apparently some rebels came in and intercepted a synth that was carrying City Eight's dispatch and transporting it for repair."
[21:28:38] Drake Salvador: Took the chip and fled. We chased 'em into the sewers anddd well, here I am now.
[21:29:19] Chloe Cullen: Good work, then.
[21:31:05] Drake Salvador: Yeaaah, I don't know. I feel like they were just a bunch of scrubs who found working firearms and decided to name themselves an organization... Revolutionary Opposition Front of something like that.
[21:31:37] Drake Salvador: I don't know. They were easy work or so I thought. A lot of units didn't come back. Both Civil Authority and the Transhuman Arm.

[21:33:19] Chloe Cullen: Seems the terrorists did better than they should have.
