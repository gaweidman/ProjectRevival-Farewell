[10:13:07] Hans Weiß: // i might be a sewer rat again
[10:13:35] Morgan Beck: // F.
[10:13:46] Hans Weiß: // nah it's kinda fun, plus people hide shit down here
[10:14:08] Morgan Beck: // Yeah. I have a  character that actually HAS to hide there, albeit OTA might be on his ass any moment tbh
[10:14:17] Hans Weiß: // rip
