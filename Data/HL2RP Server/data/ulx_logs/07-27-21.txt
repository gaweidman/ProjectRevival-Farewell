[13:49:29] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860 to admins: should be good for now
[13:49:50] Morgan Beck to admins: Alright. *just nothing too complex because brain is being stirfried*
[13:49:57] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Alright, let's get started on the rest.
[13:50:20] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y There are four main rank groupings, and 13 ranks.
[13:50:24] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Technically fourteen
[13:50:35] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y After the rank of recruit you will start out at i5 and progress into i1.
[13:50:51] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Those ranks are called ground units.
[13:51:24] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y You can give orders amongst yourselves, but it tends to happen around bigger rank differences, like i5 to i1. Not much order giving happens between i5 and i4.
[13:51:38] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /charsethunger union 100
[13:51:41] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /charsetthirst union 100
[13:51:52] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Then, you reach the rank leader ranks. Elite Protection Unit, then Squad Leader.
[13:52:31] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y These ranks are also called field command. You still patrol on these ranks, but your word goes, and you are well trusted by other units to lead effectively.
[13:52:46] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Then you have the ranks officer and divisional, in that order.
[13:53:04] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Those are your officer ranks. They rarely leave the nexus, and do supervising jobs more than anything else.
[13:53:20] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: .//fuck me, made a typo
[13:53:23] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: .//those are the command ranks
[13:53:54] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y When Command units die, it's big and bad news. Command units know the Commander and Sectorial on a next-to-personal level.
[13:54:05] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y That brings us to high command. Commander, then Sectorial.
[13:54:18] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Somebody, tell me the difference between a commander and a sectorial. Anyone. Blurt it out.
[13:54:24] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Give it a good guess.
[13:54:31] CCA.C08-RCT.08222: Commander runs the city
[13:54:42] CCA.C08-RCT.08222: Sectorial runs a sector, multiple cities?
[13:54:56] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Closest a recruit is going to be able to guess.
[13:55:10] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Yes, the commander is the leader of a city's military presence. That includes the conscripts and OTA.
[13:55:23] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y It also makes important decisions for the city alongside the City Administrator.
[13:56:01] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Many people think the City Administrator is a puppet role. This is false. The City Administrator handles the bureaucracy behind running a city. The CWU, xen cleanup, new building construction, all of that.
[13:56:39] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y The Commander is the militant leader of the city, but given how militant the Combine is, you can see where there would be a lot of overlap.
[13:56:49] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y The sectorial manages both the city and its surrounding area.
[13:57:05] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y The Earth is broken up into sectors. While there *can* be two cities in a sector, it's not common.
[13:57:40] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y So, the Sectorial manages the outlands in their entirety, and other Combine locations and forces outside of the city.
[13:57:49] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y For any of you who have been in City 17, here's a great way of thinking about it.
[13:58:11] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Commander 17 handles the city. Sectorial 17 handles the City and Nova Prospekt.
[13:58:58] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Again, there is a considerable amount of overlap between the commander and sectorial. The commander can work with the outlands and send units into it, but infrequently does so.
[13:59:06] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y The Commander and Sectorial work collaboratively.
[13:59:18] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Now, more basics.
[13:59:20] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Quartermasters.
[13:59:26] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y They have three jobs.
[14:00:01] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Managing the barracks and living conditions, authorizing supply rollout for certain operations, and managing the armor.
[14:00:06] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: The last of which is their biggest role.
[14:00:09] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: .//armory.*
[14:00:12] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y The last of which is their biggest role.
[14:00:34] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y None of you can touch the armory terminal, as units have decided to defect and take weapons and ammunition for themselves.
[14:00:49] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Those assholes ruined it for everybody, so now if you want zipties and ammunition, you see a quartermaster.
[14:01:03] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y If you lose your gun, you try to convince them it was an accident.
[14:01:19] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y They can deny any request at any time for any reason.
[14:01:47] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y They are without division, and they do not progress through ranks. They are just quartermasters.
[14:02:49] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Quartermasters can be assigned their rank at any time, although the main group tends to be i2 and up.
[14:03:06] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y In an emergency, they have the authority of an OfC, but they are not command units.
[14:03:15] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Not outside of an emergency, that isd.
[14:03:36] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Now, divisions. There are four main divisions, UNION, GRID, JUDGE, AND HELIX.
[14:03:47] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y UNION is your generic unit. Patrol, punish people for crimes, call it a day.
[14:04:01] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y All of the other divisions do UNION's job alongside their own special role.
[14:04:18] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y So if you become a HELIX unit, you won't spend all your time in the medbay. You still patrol, you still charge people for crimes, you still print IDs, and you still search.
[14:05:11] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y As you can guess from that example, HELIX units are first aid and surgery. They make boo-boos go away, they do medical procedures, they implant biosignals, they administer unionwashing, you name it.
[14:05:29] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y We'll get to unionwashing later.
[14:05:52] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y High ranking HELIX units can engage in medical research, but it's not a requirement nor do they always utilize that position.
[14:06:11] CCA.C08-RCT.77283: /looc Union washing be like bye bye PTSD.
[14:06:12] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y GRID units are mechanics and engineers. Lower ranks fix things, higher ranks make things.
[14:06:48] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y High ranking GRID units, like HELIX units, can authorize new technology research. Keep in mind, by high ranking, I mean Command units.
[14:06:58] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y JUDGE units are our investigative Bureau.
[14:07:22] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Are any of you americans? If so, think of it as the FBI and CIA rolled into one.
[14:07:47] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y They have a reputation for being interrogators, but JUDGE units are not sadists, or at least not many of them.
[14:08:05] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y They investigate anti-civil activity and try to prevent it before it happens.
[14:08:22] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y UNION units are issued certain pieces of equipment early.
[14:08:57] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y So where an EpU would get a deployable manhack normally, UNION i1s get a deployable manhack.
[14:09:07] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y For more information, see the handbook, it's all a visual download on your visor.
[14:09:45] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y GRID units receive armor repair kits as well, and HELIX units, you can guess what equipment they get. Biogel, bandages, medkits, you get the picture.
[14:09:53] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Do we have any questions so far?
[14:10:05] CCA.C17-RCT.87651: nope
[14:10:10] CCA.C08-RCT.77283: nope
[14:10:13] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y That is NO, SIR TO YOU, RECRUIT.
[14:10:23] CCA.C08-RCT.08222: No sir!
[14:10:30] CCA.C08-RCT.77283: No sir!
[14:10:36] CCA.C08-RCT.64998: No, sir.
[14:10:49] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y That's better. You want respect, earn it.
[14:11:04] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Let's try to get you all through violations.
[14:11:34] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y There's a long list of certain violations in the handbook. They have different classifications, and different punishments. I'm not going to list them off for you, just reference it when you need it.
[14:11:38] CCA.C08-RCT.77283: /looc Out of most time a plaza gets into a shoot out on another rp server, aaaa
[14:12:06] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Now, contraband. Let's get into the three levels: Green, yellow, and red.
[14:12:19] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Green contraband is harmless in most hands.
[14:12:27] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Or relatively harmless in the grand scheme of things.
[14:12:30] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Power tools.
[14:12:36] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Non UU-Branded Alcohol.
[14:12:38] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Spray paint.
[14:13:02] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y And go ahead and tack on narcotics like Crystal Meth and heroin.
[14:13:24] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Yellow contraband is useful in many hands for anti-civil activity.
[14:13:45] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Zipties, fake IDs, biogel, radios.
[14:13:54] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Red contraband is weapons.
[14:14:09] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y As well as ammunition and armor.
[14:14:19] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Anti-UU propaganda is the only exception, that does count as red contraband.
[14:14:27] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Explosives also count as red contraband.
[14:14:34] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Any questions about classifications?
[14:14:43] CCA.C08-RCT.08222: No sir!
[14:14:48] CCA.C08-RCT.77283: No sir!
[14:14:55] CCA.C08-RCT.64998: No, sir.
[14:15:02] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y 876!
[14:15:05] CCA.C17-RCT.87651: no sir!
[14:15:28] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Let's go over some basic punishment. The specifics you can look at in the handbook for reference.
[14:15:42] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Three major punishments. Amputation, re-education, and detainment.
[14:16:02] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Amputation, you already know, means the death sentence.
[14:16:07] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y It's also called capital punishment.
[14:16:14] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Or a terminal verdict.
[14:16:32] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Amputation is immediately given for level 7 violations.
[14:16:55] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Level 5 and 6 have amputation trials. Not similar to old world trials.
[14:17:30] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y A JUDGE unit, or several, look into the citizen's history of crime, their apparent loyalty, their likelihood to be a detriment to society and re-offend, et cetera.
[14:17:57] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Passing happens at the end. If the trial passes in favor of the Combine, it means amputaiton.
[14:18:23] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y If it passes in favor of the defendant, they are given all the other punishments, excluding amputation.
[14:18:33] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Alright.
[14:18:59] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Detainment is locking citizens in a cell for their crimes. Basic stuff. Lengths are found in the handbook.
[14:19:29] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Any CCA unit at the rank of i2 or higher can change all amputation verdicts to political conscription.
[14:19:47] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y This means the defendant is escorted to Nova Prospekt and made to pay their societal debt directly for the rest of their life.
[14:19:51] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y I will give no further details.
[14:20:10] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Now, civil status. There are four main ones.
[14:20:16] CCA.C17-RCT.87651: [[ brb
[14:20:19] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Loyalist, Citizen, Malignant, and Anti-citizen.
[14:20:24] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y The first two are self explanatory.
[14:20:54] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Malignant is between -1 and -10 LP. They are in the same boat as those alien slaves. Treat them like dirt.
[14:21:11] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y They are. They sooner they understand that, the sooner they can repay their debt to society and the Combine.
[14:21:34] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Below -10 is an anti-citizen. Anti-Citizens are to be amputated.
[14:22:00] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Civil Status is based exclusively off your loyalist point count. CWU members do not receive a special civil status.
[14:22:19] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y LP is rewarded for loyal acts, detailed in the handbook.
[14:22:39] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Loyalist tiers are based upon your LP count, and are indicated by the color of your loyalist armband.
[14:23:08] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Higher LP, more rations at ration cycles. We'll talk about those soon.
[14:23:21] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Do you have any questions?
[14:23:25] CCA.C08-RCT.77283: No sir!
[14:23:43] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: //649!
[14:23:45] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: //wrong chat
[14:23:51] CCA.C08-RCT.64998: No, sir.

[14:24:06] CCA.C08-RCT.08222: No sir!
[14:24:12] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y 876!

[14:24:22] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: .//and it would seem they are
[14:24:26] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Ration cycles.
[14:24:44] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Citizens line up for you to check their loyalist point count and give them ration packets accordingly.
[14:24:59] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y CWU members go to the front of the line before non-CWU members.
[14:25:15] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Your ration packets are determined by your loyalist tier.
[14:25:27] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Alright, that's the boring out of the way.
[14:25:40] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Let's get to the important and the CCA knowledge you all especially need to know.
[14:25:57] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y You all have heard Dispatch.
[14:26:12] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y She calls out procedures and codes that citizens, for the most part, do not understand.
[14:26:39] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y What is unrest procedure? It's bad, but that's all you know.
[14:26:49] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Procedures are called under certain circumstances, typically as an emergency.
[14:27:21] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y There are a few you will need to know now, but the rest you will have to refer back to the handbook for.
[14:27:29] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Judgement waiver.
[14:27:52] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y All citizens need to get to their apartments. If they don't, CCA units are free to punish them however they like.
[14:28:10] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Amputation? Sure. A light beating? Sure.
[14:28:14] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Most units pick amputation.
[14:28:32] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y After Judgement Waiver is called, you all get 3 minutes before you may start punishing.
[14:28:36] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y 180 seconds, that's more than enough.
[14:28:48] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Keep in mind, you don't have to punish citizens during a judgement waiver, but you are absolutely encouraged to.
[14:29:16] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y If you have, for example, a purple tier loyalist who claims they got held up for some reason or another, and you can tell that the route they're going is toward the apartments, you're free to let them go.
[14:29:26] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Or at the very least escort them to the apartments as quickly as you canm.
[14:29:42] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Or you could amputate them. It's up to you.
[14:30:37] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Judgement waiver is called in major emergencies. Mass shootings, bombings, rioting, et cetera.
[14:30:59] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y It is called when the otherwise normal method of handling anti-civil activity isn't necessary, and more force is needed.
[14:31:13] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Certain ranks can call judgement waiver and other procedures, you can see the information for that in the handbook.
[14:32:18] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Inspection. Group everyone up into their apartments, search them aggressively. Make sure the number of citizens counted is equal to the number of non-anti-citizens in your citizen manifest.
[14:32:23] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: .//citizen manifest is just the scoreboard
[14:32:45] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: .//count the number of shitizens, make sure it matches the number of shitizens onthe scoreboard
[14:32:50] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: .//anti-citizens don't count
[14:33:12] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: .//if you're not sure, check their data yourself OOCly. if it's below -10, don't worry about them being counted.
[14:33:32] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y By search them aggressively, I don't mean pushing them out of the way.
[14:33:43] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y If they raise a finger in the wrong direction, you throw a stunstick in their direction.
[14:34:17] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y If they're not moving, move them with your stunstick and your own physical strength.
[14:34:29] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Accidental deaths via beatings are acceptable during inspections.
[14:35:02] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y You will not be punished for accidental death, given that you didn't intentionally use lethal force. If you throw someone out of a window, you will be punished. Same goes for if you shoot them without them trying to hurt you.
[14:35:20] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y But if they're old and more or less frail, then you hit them and they die, you will not be punished.
[14:35:25] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y That just means it's their time.
[14:36:04] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Priority identification checks call all citizens to their apartment building's lobby to be searched and made sure they're all valid citizens.
[14:36:23] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Then you search their person and let them go.
[14:36:45] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Miscount happens when the number of citizens on your manifest doesn't match the total count gathered by CP teams.
[14:37:28] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y If there's too many citizens, find out who has a fake ID or why they're not showing up as a valid citizen.
[14:37:39] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y If there aren't enough citizens, find the missing one.
[14:37:46] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Any questions so far?
[14:37:58] CCA.C08-RCT.64998: No, sir.

[14:39:30] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y It's called when a hard to neutralize threat can't be handled by a single unit or a squad.
[14:39:52] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y You group up into squads, pursue the threat, and lethally apprehend it.
[14:40:00] CCA.C08-RCT.64998: /looc I need to, stand up for a moment, be right back.
[14:40:08] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y You can do this in any way you want, as long as the collateral damage is insignificant.
[14:40:33] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y If somebody fights their way through three CCA units, you can toss an HE grenade into their apartment window.
[14:40:46] Morgan Beck to admins: Alright, I'm gonna head to bed. Can't keep my eyes open much longer. Hope the rest of your day goes well!

[14:41:13] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Once you handle the threat, make sure that's all there is and then return to normal procedure.
[14:41:18] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Autonomous judgement, you kill all citizens.
[14:41:27] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y This only happens when the entire city is unsaveable.
[14:41:42] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y As in, 95% of the population is resisting.
[14:42:00] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Autonomous handoff.

[15:05:44] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Two magazines per person, one pistol per person. That case had 4 magazines and two pistols.
[15:05:59] CCA.C08-RCT.77283: Got one extra
[15:06:02] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y What is the number one rule of gun safety?
[15:06:04] CCA.C08-RCT.77283: sidearm
[15:06:19] CCA.C08-RCT.08222: Don't have it loaded unless outside
[15:06:19] CCA.C08-RCT.64998: I also, have an extra one.
[15:06:31] CCA.C08-RCT.77283: Golden rule of gun safety is not shoot your own comrades
[15:06:35] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Wrong.
[15:06:41] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Treat every gun as if it were loaded.
[15:07:04] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y I don't care if the pistol is unloaded and there's nothing chambered. You don't use the gun to jokingly point it at people.
[15:07:20] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y I don't care if the safety is on, you can't put it to the back of your fellow CCA unit's head.
[15:07:21] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Got it?
[15:07:31] CCA.C08-RCT.77283: Yes sir!
[15:07:38] CCA.C08-RCT.64998: Yes, sir.
[15:07:39] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y The rest of you?
[15:07:42] CCA.C08-RCT.08222: Yes sir!
[15:07:47] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Fantastic.
[15:08:04] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y So, there are two types of combat anyone will do. Against humans and against Xenobes.
[15:08:33] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Quick aside, you don't have to use the code words all the time. Back when I was an EpU I called headcrabs headcrabs. Just make sure to be official when talking to command and above.
[15:08:50] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Some OTA units call antlions bugs. It just depends on the person.

[15:09:23] CCA.C08-RCT.77283: /looc We call those things from Klendathu bugs
[15:09:31] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Alien Combat is simple. You don't need cover unless you're fighting osmething particularly bad. You point the gun, you shoot, you kill it.
[15:09:53] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y The strategy comes in for different types of aliens.
[15:09:59] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y You don't want to be up close and personal with a Zombie.
[15:10:31] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Nor do you want to be in large groups with snarks.
[15:10:47] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Sorry, large groups of snarks.

[15:12:57] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Tripeds, you fight from long range.
[15:13:03] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Their attack is not good for mid or close.
[15:13:20] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Antlions, there's no good range. They'll fuck you up fifteen ways from tuesday.
[15:13:39] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y But make sure to shoot them in the JOINTS and the Thorax.

[15:15:27] CCA.C08-RCT.08222: Render them dead in the legs

[15:16:19] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Correct, you should be mid to far range.
[15:16:27] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y If you're up close, make yourself not up close.
[15:16:34] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Or just shoot them.
[15:16:53] CCA.C08-RCT.77283: /looc /me sneeze
[15:16:53] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y If you're fighting people with guns, or people who just know what the hell they're doing and not some nobody who picked up a gun.
[15:17:02] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y You need to *take cover*.

[15:17:37] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y If you don't have cover, your number one priority is to find it. Do not shoot in the open.
[15:17:42] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y You *will* die.
[15:17:53] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Now, let me do an aside about flashbangs and smoke grenades.
[15:18:03] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y They're not fun things to throw and make noises.
[15:18:24] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Flashbangs effectively render a target unable to do anything.
[15:18:28] CCA.C08-RCT.77283: /looc think fast chucklenuts! ^
[15:18:30] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Smoke grenades create a fog of confusion.
[15:18:32] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: .//lmao
[15:19:14] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y You throw flashbangs and smoke grenades not to be a sneaky ninja, but to make sure they can't see you.
[15:19:21] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y If they can't see you, they don't know where to hit.

[15:20:47] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y If somebody is being a pussy and hiding behind a wall or a barrier, throw an HE grenade or a viscerator.
[15:20:56] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y That way, they *have* to move.
[15:21:04] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y That is their main purpose. Don't confuse those.
[15:21:12] CCA.C08-UNION.OfC.19860: /y Moving on.
