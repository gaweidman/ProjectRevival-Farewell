[19:05:26] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: So.....you were found in the sewers. When the OTA saw you, you procceded to run away instead of being compliant? right?
[19:05:47] Hans Weiß: If I was seen captured and just walked out I'd probably get shot.
[19:06:00] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: You are mistaken.
[19:06:11] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: If you came compliantly this would have been a whole lot easier
[19:06:18] Hans Weiß: Not by the OTA
[19:06:25] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: /radio HELIX did you search him?
[19:06:31] Hans Weiß: There was a guy down there with us

[19:07:28] Hans Weiß: Probably to keep it off him so he had less of a chance to be see with it.
[19:07:36] Hans Weiß: /looc seen*
[19:07:48] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Hm
[19:08:05] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Did you get a name and description?
[19:08:30] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: And if you were being forced why were you being malcompliant with officers?
[19:08:31] Hans Weiß: White male, didn't tell us a name, blue jumpsuit, brown hair, seemed to be average height
[19:08:59] Hans Weiß: Becaue if he just saw me walk out, he could have just shot me dead as my sorry ass was taken to the nexus
[19:09:07] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: /me Simply places his left hand on the lever near him.
[19:09:34] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Hm.....you are a ignorant fool if you believe that
[19:09:50] Hans Weiß: Why would I go willingly. Really. I'm CMB, a loyalist, I got a life to live, and a job to go with it.
[19:10:07] Hans Weiß: I've handed in enough contraband to build an entire rebellion.
[19:10:18] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Hm
[19:11:00] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: You could have ran towards the OTA empty handed and allowed him to deal with the other civvie.
[19:11:16] Hans Weiß: Again, if he saw me, who's to say he wouldn't shoot me.
[19:11:23] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: // That moment when it's difficult to find a reason to bully you
[19:11:32] Hans Weiß: Cause then he knows, if I talk he dies.
[19:11:52] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: /pm hans talk bout how he tried to shoot you too
[19:11:57] Hans Weiß: Why do you think I'm giving you as much detail as possible, and being compliant now? I know I'm safe here.
[19:12:03] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Hm
[19:12:11] Hans Weiß: /pm helix i got a whole essay ready don't worry
[19:12:19] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: .// I fucking hate that I can't find a reason to dig into the story
[19:12:22] Hans Weiß: And plus, the OTA tried to kill me the second he saw me.
[19:12:27] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: All good here?
[19:12:36] Hans Weiß: Why should I run at bullets while running from bullets?
[19:12:42] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: His story seems alright....
[19:12:59] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: If I may add...
[19:13:02] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Go for it
[19:13:15] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: He swing at me with a rock, obviously with malicous intent.
[19:13:28] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Thats why I'm not letting him go immediately
[19:13:36] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: If his story was one of trying not to be shot, then there would be no reason for this.
[19:13:55] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Especially when I had a better brain then the OTA not to shoot on sight.
[19:14:06] Hans Weiß: Well it's better to knock out an officer, and leave them to get some medical treatment for some bruising than get shot by ota or anti-civvies
[19:14:20] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: The OTA probably wasn't gonna shoot until the civvie's ran
[19:14:41] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: I doubt there was need for shots. I already had the entrance locked down.
[19:14:46] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: But anyway.
[19:14:51] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: I'll let you have this.
[19:15:08] Hans Weiß: Well I got shot in the leg, so I got adreneline running, parasites eating away at me, rebel's trying to kill me, and who am I supposed to think straight.
[19:15:18] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Hm
[19:15:19] Hans Weiß: /looc how*
[19:15:26] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: .// I fucking hate you and this story
[19:15:36] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: .// If only I was good at interrogations
[19:15:46] Hans Weiß: You can mark me for being a dumbass, but for being an anti-citizen, I will fight that claim to the grave.

[19:19:40] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: You had contraband on you correct? You are known for turning this in correct?
[19:19:56] Hans Weiß: I had contraband after the man forced me to take it.
[19:20:07] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Alright makes sense, makes sense.
[19:20:12] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: But
[19:20:25] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: So if we search the apartment, we won't find any more?
[19:20:43] Hans Weiß: I don't know, I let another guy crash with me so he might have something in there.
[19:20:57] Paweł Kalinowski: /charfallover
[19:21:16] Hans Weiß: If you want I can go with you to check if he put anything in my lockers recently.
[19:21:33] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: You have no lockers first off.
[19:21:34] Client "Johnnie butters" connected.

[19:22:03] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: You ordered them.
[19:22:17] Hans Weiß: Yeah I put them on so people don't steal from them, that doesn't mean he can't access them.
[19:22:28] Hans Weiß: The man pretty much lives with me so he knows the code.
[19:22:32] Paweł Kalinowski: /charfallover
[19:22:34] Hans Weiß: He was there when the guy set it up.
[19:22:48] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: You never turned in any codes to the CCA, which is a requirement.
[19:22:57] Hans Weiß: I was never told it was.
[19:23:11] Hans Weiß: The salesman at the furniture store never informed me.
[19:23:51] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Interesting, but with you knowing the codes, you surely know what is inside.
[19:24:12] Hans Weiß: I don't check it most of the time, I'm CMB, I have a job.
[19:24:30] Hans Weiß: Plus I spend most of my time searching for contra, to give in.
[19:24:36] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: And since you don't know if the man also living there is hiding any items in there and you are mentioning it as possible, if we found any items there you can be listed and helping anti-citizens.
[19:24:56] Hans Weiß: If he put it there without telling me, how am I helping him?
[19:25:07] Hans Weiß: And then giving you the codes to see what he put there.
[19:25:14] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Alright, well you know him enough that he lives with you.
[19:25:17] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: I want a name.
[19:25:33] Hans Weiß: Some polish name, like Pawek or something, I was never good with names.
[19:25:37] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: /me grabs the lever.
[19:25:40] Hans Weiß: Weasel or something.
[19:25:40] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Kalinowski?
[19:25:44] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: I don't want to say it twice.
[19:26:06] Hans Weiß: It's some polish name, I wrote a prescription for him when you were near by i5.
[19:26:30] Hans Weiß: You brought him to the hospital where I head his zombie wounds.
[19:26:43] Hans Weiß: /looc healed*

[19:26:52] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: You wrote the perscription
[19:27:00] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: That was only early today.
[19:27:00] Hans Weiß: I probably have a record for it with his full CID.
[19:27:13] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: I just need a name man.
[19:27:15] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Nothing else.
[19:27:22] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Then you can get back to your life.

[19:44:17] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Does he have finger prints on the clothing and riot shield?
[19:44:20] Hans Weiß: In a cabinet, that I check rarely.
[19:44:26] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: On the riot shield yes,
[19:44:28] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Hm

[19:45:29] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Why would you keep it?
[19:45:29] Hans Weiß: He probably used them for it.
[19:45:37] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Why did you have random doors?
[19:45:38] Hans Weiß: I kept the doors for scrap.
[19:45:46] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: You have no use for scrap.
[19:45:56] Hans Weiß: Repairs if need be.
[19:46:09] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: I'm sure there is a CWU shop in the city for that.
[19:46:09] Hans Weiß: Also the scrap can be pretty useful for onsite medical work.
[19:46:20] Hans Weiß: Wait you can sell scrap?
[19:46:30] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Yes.
[19:46:43] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Some people around buy that for CWU purposes.
[19:46:46] Hans Weiß: Hmm. Looks like I'll be trying a few new things.
[19:47:03] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: But none the less, how would you melt it down to scrap?
[19:47:11] Hans Weiß: I can break it apart.
[19:47:16] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: With what?
[19:47:23] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: That hammer in there won
[19:47:26] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Won't do it
[19:48:41] Hans Weiß: Hammer? Oh yeah. I grabbed those a little bit ago to hand it in. But I got caught up in the rebel thing.
[19:49:03] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: That isn't the point.
[19:49:28] Hans Weiß: I mean I can use heavy objects to bend, and break it apart.
[19:49:42] Hans Weiß: Or I could sell the thing as scrap alone.
[19:50:09] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: But that is flimsy
[19:50:18] Hans Weiß: I mean it's still scrap is it not?
[19:50:28] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: I'm talking about the hammer
[19:50:33] Hans Weiß: Oh.

[19:54:25] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Hm
[19:54:43] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: First we need to bring the evidence here from the apartment for evidence.
[19:55:12] Hans Weiß: So you need me to say anything else?
[19:55:16] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Then I'll just list this as a level two offense for the attempted assult.

[20:24:26] Paweł Kalinowski: /it The face is cut at several parts, more or less slashes. The face can barely be recognised as pawel after blood is cleared.

[20:25:19] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: /me takes gauze out of bag and places it on the wounded areas before taping it to the skin so it doesn't fall out.
[20:25:40] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Likely passed out from pain, not so much blunt force trauma.
[20:26:29] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: /me applies the IV bag to the mans arm.
[20:27:30] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: /me takes a syringe from the back and puts it into the mans vein, withdrawing blood.
[20:27:40] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Alright I'll get this tested.

[20:29:02] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: // NAT 100
[20:31:34] Paweł Kalinowski: /it the blood contains alcohol, and painkillers. The mixture of which can knock the person out. The red blood cell count is low hinting to heavy blood loss. Trace amounts of necrotic chemicals are in the blood stream hinting to a necrotic attack or -
[20:31:46] Paweł Kalinowski: /it necrotic based drugs.
[20:32:25] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Well the necrotic DNA is relative to the attack he was treated for earlier.
[20:32:49] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: The alcohol is not the hardest to obtain.
[20:33:06] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Painkillers were perscribed earlier in his treatment as well.
[20:33:30] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Blood loss makes sense due to the wounds found on the facial region.
[20:34:05] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: /me takes a look for any damage on the man besides the face.
[20:35:57] Client "66gs" connected.
[20:36:15] Paweł Kalinowski: /it Several cuts are clearly on the mans front half, A few on his arms, legs. A lot more deeper cuts can be found on his back, a small X on the other side of the body on the lower back can be found. but it's only 2 inch each slash and only a few millimeter
[20:36:19] Paweł Kalinowski: /it deep.
[20:36:36] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: hm
[20:37:43] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: /me takes rubbing alcohol and rubs the wounds on the mans body with it, afterwards taking guaze and wrapping it around the areas.
[20:38:11] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: /me grabs a patient gown from the rack.
[20:38:25] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: /me wraps it around his neck so he has damn clothes.
[20:38:56] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: I don't know much else I can do with this.

[20:53:28] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: /me is fiddling with a stunstick, bored as hell.
[20:54:52] Paweł Kalinowski: /me would slowly wake up, He'd blink a little, lick his lipps a little like an old man does, before closing his eyes again, and rubbing his eyes to clear up his vision. By this time It's noticable that he has awoken.
[20:55:01] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Hm?
[20:55:07] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Finally
[20:55:18] Paweł Kalinowski: Did I finish shitting?
[20:55:33] Paweł Kalinowski: I was out for that long?
[20:55:39] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: You are in the Civil Hospital.
[20:55:45] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: I had to treat you.
[20:55:51] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: How did you get like this Pawel?
[20:56:29] Paweł Kalinowski: Good question, I just woke up, give me like some water or something my voice is killing me.
[20:56:42] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Alright.

[20:57:34] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: There, you gonna get up or no?
[20:58:48] Paweł Kalinowski: /me would take the water and pop open the tab before drinking it. He'd finish drinking it in one go. before saying "I remember this place, Did I have my constipation problem again?"
[20:59:36] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: No, you were stabbed, left in a freezing bathtub and had a large red X on your back.
[21:00:01] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: And suspiciously after you ran from Units in the sewers.
[21:00:54] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: No, you were stabbed, left in a freezing bathtub and had a large rex X on your back.
[21:01:10] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: And suspiciously after you ran from Units in the sewers.
[21:03:17] Paweł Kalinowski: /me he'd listen to what the unit had to say "That don't sound like constipation. Let me think, What was I doing?", He'd begin scratching his chin, feeling the bandages and saying "Dear god, What did happen to me." He'd look at the rest of his body.
[21:03:42] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: I don't believe this is hard to understand
[21:03:57] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: You know who did this?
[21:06:07] Paweł Kalinowski: I understand full. I do remember a fellow in a blue suit and black hair sometime ago. Most while I was in the sewers as you said. I remember him a little, give me more time to think and I think I might be able to draw up what he looks like.
[21:06:40] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Why were you in there anyway?
[21:07:46] Paweł Kalinowski: My friend was leading me to some resistance areas, he wanted me to be with him so when we report it we both get the credit, He's a good person in that way.
[21:08:15] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Your "Good" friends name?
[21:09:42] Paweł Kalinowski: Ham... Ham... Ummm, Hams wirB. I think I said it right he was a german buddy, the unlikly friends a polish and a german.
[21:10:04] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: /advert OH SHIT I NEED A MEDIC BAG! (OVER/FALSE)
[21:10:09] Paweł Kalinowski: WeiB*
[21:10:41] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Why would you go down in the first place? Just notify the CCA of the location.
[21:13:03] Paweł Kalinowski: Again, we both wanted wanted the credit. Plus he wasn't 100% sure about the location either, the notepad he found aparently said "The base is by the shack". We checked the shack that sells stuff, but we didn't find the quote on quote base. So we thought i-
[21:13:38] Paweł Kalinowski: it might be in the sewers, and in the end we found it, but when we tried to get out we were getting blocked at every exit.
[21:13:55] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Interesting.
[21:13:58] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: However.
[21:14:15] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Notifing CCA was the best option in this situation.
[21:14:42] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: There was absolutely no reason for some Citizens to have to go down into the sewers for this.
[21:14:54] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: If the location was confirmed than you would have been fine.
[21:15:00] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Now next point
[21:15:12] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Why the hell did you run from the OTA?
[21:16:20] Client "waltstasz" connected.
[21:16:39] Paweł Kalinowski: That was an OTA? All I saw was big bullets rip through Zombies. The last think I'm worried about is who is shooting the zombies, I heard BOOM BOOM BOOM, and I ran. And my friends got hit even more reason to run.
[21:17:39] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Fair enough, but why attack the Unit waiting at the entrance?
[21:17:51] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Absolutely no reason for that.
[21:21:20] Paweł Kalinowski: Tunnel vision, your a person of medical / police status you should know this, it's a basic psychology defence, My goal  was probably to get out of gun fire, So I when for the exit. I must have attacked a unit in the process.
[21:23:02] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: The CCA expects you not to attack any units at all, especially during recovery.
[21:23:42] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Running and attacking units is the exact reason you ended up here with me in the room.
[21:24:02] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Not to mention your comrade also attacked too
[21:24:11] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Both of you had a reason not to be there.
[21:27:30] Paweł Kalinowski: Exactly, and we both had a reason to exit. We were getting shot at. Tell me if you were in my shoes don't you think you would have done the same, and an old man, blue tier loyalist who is getting shot at, and all that's stopping is the silhouette of a pe- 
[21:27:43] Paweł Kalinowski: person, You are bound to try to get out of there.
[21:28:30] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: You are a loyalist, you had no point to be down there or attack a damn officer. We can charge you for this shit! Get your damn head straight!
[21:29:24] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: I don't fucking give a shit whether you had damn tunnel vision or not. I get this is a stressful situation. I get it.
[21:29:42] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: But you can't fucking do this.
[21:30:17] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: I have next to no training in this shit, they just run you through the basics, and I handle it better.
[21:31:22] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Even afterward
[21:31:26] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Turn yourself in

[21:36:37] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Why do you have illegal shit in your friends apartment?
[21:36:56] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: We have the prints.
[21:37:04] Paweł Kalinowski: Which items were illegal?
[21:37:37] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: I don't know the riot shield, some of the tools and the body armor.
[21:37:51] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Stuff you most defently don't need as a loyalist.
[21:38:12] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Tools? Fine, no biggie.
[21:38:26] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Riot shield and armor? What the hell.
[21:38:42] Paweł Kalinowski: He wanted them to be made, We created a welder and he had scape. We turned into something useful.
[21:38:46] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Granted your friend had prints as well.
[21:39:03] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Something useful to kill an officer.
[21:39:14] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: There is no escuse for this one.
[21:39:23] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Look and we questioned your buddy too.
[21:39:36] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: And we won't let him go on this either.
[21:39:48] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: There is no point to having this.
[21:39:53] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: This you have to admit.
[21:40:48] Paweł Kalinowski: I do, we both made it. He got me the materials, and we created it together. A few of the things I had better handle at but we did do it.
[21:41:39] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: // Q you doing stuff?

[21:43:37] Paweł Kalinowski: I'm fine with that.

[21:43:52] CCA.C14-HELIX.i5.50299: Being in the sewers, I can let go.
