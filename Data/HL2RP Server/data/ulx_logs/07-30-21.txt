[12:45:32] Dimitri Sikon: the nearby Overwatch outpost was successfully raided and i discovered it leads right into the nexus
[12:46:06] An Unknown Voice: You discovered it leads right into the nexus... did you find a map or something?
[12:46:46] Dimitri Sikon: no, i broke in
[12:46:50] An Unknown Voice: You fucking WHAT?
[12:46:55] Dimitri Sikon: took a series of combine implements
[12:47:02] Dimitri Sikon: shot at some of the white guys
[12:47:11] Dimitri Sikon: you know the cyclopic ones
[12:47:14] Dimitri Sikon: killed one
[12:47:16] An Unknown Voice: Yeah, them.
[12:47:17] Dimitri Sikon: and then left
[12:47:18] An Unknown Voice: How the shit..
[12:47:20] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.67098: // Wait I never got my fuckin flashbang
[12:47:21] An Unknown Voice: Holy fuck.
[12:47:32] An Unknown Voice removed all access rights from CCA.C08-UNION.i3.67098
[12:47:43] Dimitri Sikon: now i have one of their snipers, but it is Gene-locked
[12:47:48] Dimitri Sikon: you know how to bust them open?
[12:48:06] An Unknown Voice: Ugh. Genelocking. Damn the Combine for ever inventing that.
[12:48:10] An Unknown Voice: Well, you're talking to the right guy.
[12:48:25] Dimitri Sikon: is it a software thing?
[12:48:27] An Unknown Voice: Let me check through my files here... Give me a second.
[12:48:39] An Unknown Voice: I've got notes on it somewhere.
[12:48:59] An Unknown Voice: /it You hear a filing cabinet opening.
[12:49:10] An Unknown Voice: Got it.
[12:49:21] An Unknown Voice: So, it looks like the pulse weapons were built to be genelocked.
[12:49:30] Dimitri Sikon: yup, from what i can see
[12:49:48] An Unknown Voice: The whole way they work, and excuse me for oversimplifying
[12:50:33] An Unknown Voice: But the whole way they work is that half of the gun itself is based on firmware. That's read only stuff used for really basic things.
[12:50:40] An Unknown Voice: But the whole way they work is that half of the gun itself is based on firmware. That's read only stuff used for really basic things.
[12:50:51] An Unknown Voice: TV remotes, washing machines, you get it.
[12:50:52] Dimitri Sikon: yea i get that
[12:51:37] An Unknown Voice: Alright, let's just go from top down.
[12:51:59] An Unknown Voice: So you put in a genetic sample to a machine, the machine makes the gun understand, "Yeah, this is the genetic sample I need."
[12:52:21] Dimitri Sikon: from myself?
[12:52:22] An Unknown Voice: Then if someone tries to fire, the trigger can be pulled, but it doesn't do anything.
[12:52:41] An Unknown Voice: No, the one you have is already genecoded to someone else. Assumedly from a SCALPEL unit.
[12:52:58] Dimitri Sikon: oh so do i need to remove whatever genetic material is inside and replace it with my own?
[12:53:16] An Unknown Voice: Not quite. The programming is hardwired into the gun.
[12:53:17] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.67098: // time for ration distribution uwu
[12:53:17] An Unknown Voice: Let me just say.
[12:53:22] An Unknown Voice: You *can* undo it.
[12:53:24] An Unknown Voice: But it's not easy.
[12:53:29] Dimitri Sikon: what is required?
[12:53:37] An Unknown Voice: Well, let's work through it.
[12:54:00] An Unknown Voice: The sample and programming are hardwired into the gun. It's not a physical sample, it's essentially biological information built into digital storage.
[12:54:10] Dimitri Sikon: like a USB of sorts
[12:54:23] An Unknown Voice: Sure, but the digital storage is built into the gun.
[12:54:30] Dimitri Sikon: alright
[12:54:49] Dimitri Sikon: i presume i need to remove and then somehow wipe that storage and install my own biological data
[12:55:02] An Unknown Voice: That would be a way of doing it. To do that, you need to get into the gun.
[12:55:13] An Unknown Voice: Which is its own bitch of a task.
[12:55:13] Dimitri Sikon: i presume i need tools
[12:55:17] Dimitri Sikon: wreches
[12:55:19] Dimitri Sikon: pliers
[12:55:22] Dimitri Sikon: crowbars
[12:55:38] An Unknown Voice: Little prehistoric in the Combine's eyes, but let me check what the fastening is, hold on
[12:55:52] Dimitri Sikon: bear with me for 2 minutes i need to do something
[12:55:58] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.67098: // Aww my propping powers have been eliminated :C
[12:57:39] Dimitri Sikon: im back
[12:57:50] Dimitri Sikon: so i might have some materials to help wit this
[12:57:58] Dimitri Sikon: or an idea at least
[12:58:07] An Unknown Voice: Shoot
[12:58:55] Dimitri Sikon: I managed to get an un-set Gene-lock for the doors, which i presume use the same function as the weapons, what if i used that lock to get a genetic imprint of myself and used the locks software to overwrite the data already on the gun
[12:59:19] Dimitri Sikon: it would be like copying information from one hard drive to another
[12:59:47] An Unknown Voice: Alright, so let me try to get my mind around this.
[13:00:33] An Unknown Voice: So get a Combine Lock, like the door kind. Use that to get your genetic imprint, and then swap the imprint on the gun with the imprint of the lock?
[13:00:40] Dimitri Sikon: yup
[13:01:02] Dimitri Sikon: i can't believe that they function differently
[13:01:03] An Unknown Voice: The Combine Lock is based off of biosignal
[13:01:22] Dimitri Sikon: let me check
[13:02:07] Dimitri Sikon: right it is on the table
[13:02:15] Dimitri Sikon: would it help in any way?
[13:02:40] An Unknown Voice: I'm only talking on a radio, but do you mean those locks they put on doors?
[13:02:46] Dimitri Sikon: yes
[13:03:30] An Unknown Voice: Those work differently. They're based on biosignals, not genetic signatures
[13:03:42] Dimitri Sikon: alright
[13:03:51] Dimitri Sikon: anyway, as you were saying about getting into the gun
[13:04:17] An Unknown Voice: Right. Seems like it uses a wrench very similar to allen-wrenches.
[13:04:23] An Unknown Voice: Or hex keys as some people call them
[13:04:28] Dimitri Sikon: right
[13:04:34] Dimitri Sikon: well i have a wrench right here
[13:04:38] Dimitri Sikon: what else
[13:04:41] An Unknown Voice: Wrong kind of wrench.
[13:04:49] Dimitri Sikon: oh you mean the small keys?
[13:04:53] An Unknown Voice: Yeah, those.
[13:04:59] An Unknown Voice: This one here is a unique shape, you've got to get it from a GRID unit.
[13:05:13] Dimitri Sikon: but i can't even go into the city
[13:05:14] An Unknown Voice: .//one sec
[13:06:40] An Unknown Voice: .//back
[13:06:44] An Unknown Voice: /pm dimitr iback
[13:07:01] Dimitri Sikon: I cant go into the city, i have no supplies really
[13:07:01] An Unknown Voice: Hm. Right, the nexus thing.
[13:07:06] An Unknown Voice: Oh.
[13:07:18] An Unknown Voice: Going into the city is the easy part. Getting out is the hard part.
[13:07:22] Dimitri Sikon: there is very little food
[13:07:28] Dimitri Sikon: actually
[13:07:36] Dimitri Sikon: you said tyou knew this person prior to me
[13:07:40] An Unknown Voice: If you want to risk going in, you can, but I don't recommend it.
[13:07:43] An Unknown Voice: Yeah, why?
[13:07:47] Dimitri Sikon: did you know where they keept weapons?
[13:07:55] Dimitri Sikon: because that is a big deficit at the moment
[13:07:59] Dimitri Sikon: the means to defend ourselves
[13:08:01] An Unknown Voice: I don't, sorry. I never saw the place with my eyes.
[13:08:04] Dimitri Sikon: fuck
[13:08:10] Dimitri Sikon: anyway, continue
[13:08:19] Dimitri Sikon: i need to get a GRID allen key
[13:08:26] Dimitri Sikon: how do i go about this?
[13:08:53] An Unknown Voice: Mug one. Bribe one. Sneak into the nexus again? I'm kidding, don't do that, you will die.
[13:09:06] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.67098: // Q
[13:09:07] An Unknown Voice: Try to find one in an industrial area, there may be one.
[13:09:07] An Unknown Voice: //yo
[13:09:15] Dimitri Sikon: wait....
[13:09:17] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.67098: // do we really need to keep all the transfer token things
[13:09:22] Dimitri Sikon: there is an abandoned CCA checkpoint
[13:09:27] Dimitri Sikon: there might be one in there
[13:09:43] An Unknown Voice: //indeed, that's why there's so many fuckin uhhhh
[13:09:46] Dimitri Sikon: would that be a good place to look?
[13:09:47] An Unknown Voice: //file cabinets
[13:09:56] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.67098: // They stopped putting them in the cabinets
[13:10:03] An Unknown Voice: Wouldn't hurt to try.
[13:10:18] Dimitri Sikon: right, so aside from the allen key is there anything else i require?
[13:10:48] An Unknown Voice: Probably a screwdriver, I would imagine.
[13:11:01] Dimitri Sikon: right
[13:11:02] An Unknown Voice: And then...
[13:11:11] An Unknown Voice: I can't quite say.
[13:11:21] Dimitri Sikon: we'll cross that bridge when we come to it
[13:11:25] An Unknown Voice: Right.
[13:11:25] Dimitri Sikon: i have a question for you
[13:11:33] An Unknown Voice: Go ahead.
[13:11:36] Dimitri Sikon: you keep in contact with all the rebel cells
[13:11:45] Dimitri Sikon: bu more importantly the supply chains am i right?
[13:11:49] An Unknown Voice: Well, ALL is a strong word. But a lot of them, yes.
[13:12:01] An Unknown Voice: I... *could*.
[13:12:02] Dimitri Sikon: I'm going to request 2 things if possible
[13:12:12] An Unknown Voice: I'm going to promise nothing, but go ahead.
[13:12:24] Dimitri Sikon: A water filtration unit, and a nutrition unit
[13:12:32] Dimitri Sikon: if people are going to start operating here again
[13:12:37] Dimitri Sikon: this base needs some autonomy
[13:12:43] An Unknown Voice: Right, right.
[13:12:54] An Unknown Voice: Nutrition unit, can you please be just a little more specific?
[13:12:58] An Unknown Voice: Do you mean food?
[13:13:13] Dimitri Sikon: yes, but the device used to recycle organic matter into food
[13:13:26] An Unknown Voice: I... did not know that was a thing.
[13:13:30] An Unknown Voice: I'll look into it.
[13:13:31] Dimitri Sikon: Combine use them
[13:13:36] An Unknown Voice: Water filtration unit, though, for sure I can look into.
[13:13:40] Dimitri Sikon: it's how people are fed
[13:13:42] Dimitri Sikon: perfect
[13:13:49] Dimitri Sikon: oh
[13:13:50] Dimitri Sikon: also
[13:13:51] An Unknown Voice: I can't promise anything, but I'll ask arund.
[13:13:54] Dimitri Sikon: some body armour
[13:13:57] Dimitri Sikon: a single vest
[13:14:11] Dimitri Sikon: maybe something pre-war?
[13:14:13] An Unknown Voice: We talking flak jacket, we talking CP uniform?
[13:14:18] An Unknown Voice: Pre-war.
[13:14:20] Dimitri Sikon: no, pre-war
[13:14:25] Dimitri Sikon: like body armour
[13:14:33] Dimitri Sikon: /looc a killa vest
[13:14:38] An Unknown Voice: I can look into a conscript flak jacket, those are easy to get your hands on.
[13:14:44] Dimitri Sikon: that'd help
[13:14:49] Dimitri Sikon: also padlocks
[13:14:52] An Unknown Voice: Padlocks, right.
[13:14:56] Dimitri Sikon: lots of padlocks
[13:15:04] An Unknown Voice: There may be a guy who sells them, they talked about this guy in the sewer who sold them, but I don't know what his prices are.
[13:15:11] Client "Muttie'" connected.
[13:15:15] An Unknown Voice: And then you should be able to find them about anywhere, but got it. I'll look into a consistent supply for you.
[13:15:19] Dimitri Sikon: haven't seen ANYONE in the sewers
[13:15:29] An Unknown Voice: Hm.
[13:15:32] An Unknown Voice: I hear he's down there.
[13:15:35] Dimitri Sikon: /looc you mean the shady guy yea?
[13:15:35] An Unknown Voice: Or she, hell if I know.

[19:11:13] Dimitri Sikon: /looc there aren't all the materials in the server to do this
[19:11:15] Jacob Lawson to admins: who is her
[19:11:17] Naomi Bennet: /me grunted from the pain and glares at the Helix. She's used to getting shot, seems. "Yeah I'd love to see that."

[19:12:34] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.64998 to admins: She is threatening to kill us

[19:12:39] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.64998 to admins: Threat to society basically
[19:12:44] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.64998 to admins: We can't conscript her
[19:12:55] Dimitri Sikon: /looc i cant read the book you gave me
[19:12:58] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.64998 to admins: I see that as the only option

[19:13:11] Dimitri Sikon: /looc yea i am aware
[19:13:19] Dimitri Sikon: /looc i want to do something
[19:13:22] Jacob Lawson to admins: or make her a stalker

[19:13:26] CCA.C08-HELIX.SqL.44563: /radio Judge, let me have a word with you before we're done here.
[19:13:29] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.64998 to admins: Alright making sure because it wasn't in the handbook per say aboutt it

[19:13:39] Jacob Lawson to admins: look in the political conscription second in the guide
[19:13:47] Dimitri Sikon: /looc the crafting options are miniscule
[19:13:56] Dimitri Sikon: /looc and require materials i cant find
[19:14:08] Franz Ferdinand: // why has ooc gone so quiet.. ;~;

[19:14:23] Jacob Lawson: .//you can RP crafting things that aren't there. the recipes are there, but you can't see them because of your engineering level. that's an improvement i ahve to make. otherwise, you can be creative in ways, but this is a bit ambitious for someone with 8
[19:14:25] Jacob Lawson: .//eng
[19:14:32] Naomi Bennet: Thanks. Now go to hell.
[19:14:45] CCA.C08-HELIX.SqL.44563: Right, so they seem to think that we're just going to blast her head in and toss her body down a hole. She seems to have a hatred for us as we're 'Union Slaves'. I feel like uh... maybe conscription into OHS, because with the way she's going...
[19:14:47] CCA.C08-HELIX.i1.97789: Hah. Don't think I will.
[19:14:50] CCA.C08-HELIX.i1.97789: You, though..
[19:14:51] CCA.C08-HELIX.SqL.44563: She's going to have to be tried for amputation.
[19:14:54] CCA.C08-HELIX.i1.97789: There are places worse than hell.
[19:14:59] Dimitri Sikon: /looc well there is a really limited amount of things i can do
[19:15:05] Dimitri Sikon: /looc i have really high end materials
[19:15:09] Dimitri Sikon: /looc and no low end ones
[19:15:13] CCA.C08-HELIX.i1.97789: I  have a feeling you're going to one of them.
[19:15:18] Dimitri Sikon: /looc i dont have any help
[19:15:22] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.64998: Protocol dictates stalkerfication or amputation
[19:15:24] Naomi Bennet: Gladly.
[19:15:32] CCA.C08-HELIX.SqL.44563: Protocol also states Political Conscription.
[19:15:33] Jacob Lawson: .//the predefined crafting recipes are limited, yes, but you can still get creative and make things that aren't a literal OTA helmet from scratch
[19:15:35] Dimitri Sikon: /looc and it is risky to go out and do stuff due to the lack fo any form of weapons
[19:15:37] CCA.C08-HELIX.SqL.44563: Either way.
[19:15:40] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.64998: She won't be useful to it
[19:15:42] Jacob Lawson: .//you have armor scraps and an armor repair kit, that's great, you can do something with that
