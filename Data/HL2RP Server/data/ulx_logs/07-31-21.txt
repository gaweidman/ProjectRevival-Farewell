[14:08:37] Uriel Akkad: // Which is easily the nicest.
[14:08:37] Dimitri Sikon: Right, well that doesn't solve my problem
[14:08:41] An Unknown Voice: .//maybe you only found 3
[14:08:42] Emily Brown: // yea
[14:08:43] Dimitri Sikon: because it requires ammunition
[14:08:57] An Unknown Voice: .//but I swear, hand to God almighty, that I hid much more than three.

[14:09:54] Dimitri Sikon: /looc with all the materials here, i think a fair amount of high-end crafts are possible
[14:09:55] An Unknown Voice: Nothing is perfectly sustainable, you're always going to need to use something to make things work. It's a matter of how easy it is to get the materials for those things.
[14:10:03] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: Shut it
[14:10:08] An Unknown Voice: .//and you're right to think that
[14:10:33] Dimitri Sikon: then why am i unable to have something use the most common energy source around, such as electricity

[14:11:16] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.67098: You should.
[14:11:19] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.67098: Follow.
[14:11:21] An Unknown Voice: You can, though. That's what I'm saying. But something has to be used up in the process to use that dark energy.
[14:11:36] Dimitri Sikon: the only other thing i can even think of is an electromagnetic bow
[14:11:40] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: /y Where'd you get this?
[14:11:42] Dimitri Sikon: that uses pulse ammunition

[14:11:53] An Unknown Voice: Why a bow, though?
[14:11:58] An Unknown Voice: That's so specific
[14:12:00] Dimitri Sikon: its quiet
[14:12:02] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.67098: /addtenant Emily
[14:12:05] Dimitri Sikon: it doesn't make noise
[14:12:07] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.67098: There you go.
[14:12:12] Emily Brown: Thank you, Officer.
[14:12:15] Anya Solovyov: It was given to me by Civil Protection when I was momentarily drafted to help them.
[14:12:15] An Unknown Voice: Eh, fair point.
[14:12:18] Dimitri Sikon: which is needed when there are OTA crawling everywhere
[14:12:19] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.67098: If you see Dimitri Sikon, report him.
[14:12:25] Emily Brown: Why?
[14:12:30] Anya Solovyov: I work for nobody, but I don't stay in the city either.
[14:12:32] Dimitri Sikon: right
[14:12:33] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.67098: We're looking for him.
[14:12:36] Emily Brown: Ah, I see.
[14:12:38] Dimitri Sikon: /me lets out a long sigh
[14:12:38] Emily Brown: Of course.
[14:12:39] Anya Solovyov: I'm no rebel. I'm no 'anti-citizen'.
[14:12:40] An Unknown Voice: I'll try to help you through this. Let me look at everything known.
[14:12:42] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: I highly doubt that, given you said you have allies.

[14:13:01] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: And who are they, Anya?
[14:13:02] Anya Solovyov: Of course I do, it's not just me out there.
[14:13:10] Emily Brown: // the apartment door wont close help
[14:13:14] Anya Solovyov: Names.. I don't know them. They tend to keep to themselves as well.
[14:13:20] An Unknown Voice: //is there a prop in the way?
[14:13:21] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.67098: // sorry im off duty on helping

[14:13:28] Emily Brown: // nope
[14:13:32] Anya Solovyov: What would I be resisting?
[14:13:32] Emily Brown: // not that i see here
[14:13:38] Anya Solovyov: I didn't even resist capture.
[14:13:40] Dimitri Sikon: the Pulse ammunition is simply plasma rounds
[14:13:44] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: And yet you said to get away
[14:13:51] An Unknown Voice: Nope, it's not plasma. Plasma is superheated.
[14:13:55] An Unknown Voice: It's dark energy.
[14:13:59] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: You're in a resistance group, tell me the truth

[14:14:29] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.67098: /kickdoor
[14:14:30] An Unknown Voice: The Combine uses dark energy in most things they do.
[14:14:39] Anya Solovyov: There is no group. Not that I'm in... There is *a* group. It's deep, as far as I'm aware.
[14:14:50] An Unknown Voice: Their portals to other universes? Dark energy. Their regular pulse ammunition? Dark energy.
[14:14:55] Anya Solovyov: I'm not interested in killing or burning or whatever shit they plan to do.
[14:15:04] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: Who are they?
[14:15:08] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: A group name
[14:15:08] An Unknown Voice: Their APCs? Dark energy. The air filters? Those are run off of a network of electricity that is generated from dark energy.
[14:15:12] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: I want names
[14:15:12] An Unknown Voice: same goes for all their cities

[14:15:17] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: I.Want.Names.
[14:15:17] Anya Solovyov: A name.. I don't believe there is one.
[14:15:23] An Unknown Voice: If it's made by the Combine, the driving force is almost always dark energy
[14:15:24] Anya Solovyov: I haven't seen them in a long, long time.
[14:15:27] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.67098: /radio And for a drink.
[14:15:28] Anya Solovyov: Maybe they're dead.
[14:15:32] Anya Solovyov: One of them was a CP.
[14:15:36] An Unknown Voice: Dark energy is released for the normal fire, it's just not nearly as much
[14:15:37] Anya Solovyov: Another a conscript.
[14:15:55] Dimitri Sikon: right, so why not use polarise magnets and a capacitor to direct it?
[14:16:07] Anya Solovyov: It's dangerous to be around. Not good for you lot, for sure.
[14:16:21] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: A conscript?
[14:16:22] CCA.C08-UNION.i3.67098: Alright..
[14:16:29] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: Highly unlikely
[14:16:36] Anya Solovyov: Hate to tell you, but it's true.
[14:16:45] Anya Solovyov: I'm not sure if they're a fighter or an informant.
[14:16:50] Anya Solovyov: Could be both.
[14:17:09] Anya Solovyov: Like I said, I don't deal much with them.
[14:17:16] Anya Solovyov: I didn't leave the city to join a military.
[14:17:20] An Unknown Voice: It doesn't need directed, it comes out in whatever direction you discharge it in.
[14:17:26] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: So why did you think you could come here with this weapon?
[14:17:33] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: What could you possibly have achieved?
[14:17:39] An Unknown Voice: That's why pulse weapons have basically no barrel but real guns do
