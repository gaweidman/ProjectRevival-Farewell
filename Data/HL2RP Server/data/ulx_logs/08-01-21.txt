[16:44:56] Dave Smith: /apply
[16:44:57] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: Let's talk.
[16:44:58] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: The entire conscription can be deemed inadequate
[16:45:01] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: /me taps onto his PDA
[16:45:08] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: If this is a planned desertion
[16:45:08] Marcus Sexton: What's this priority union I heard from that announcment?
[16:45:13] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: Potentially
[16:45:16] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: /me slides the standard grade ration through the terminal window
[16:45:21] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: Bon appetite.
[16:45:25] Dave Smith: thanks
[16:45:25] Franz Ferdinand: CWU Workers get priority.
[16:45:29] Franz Ferdinand: Us regular citizens dont.
[16:45:32] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: If it's seen as too high of a risk who knows what the Commander will authorize
[16:45:54] Marcus Sexton: Mhmm sounds like a good thing to have, whats the C-W-U?
[16:45:58] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: Ethan's record shows he was never unionwashed, that's why he was able to break away so easily.
[16:46:05] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: He apparently got in just under the wire.
[16:46:06] Franz Ferdinand: Civil Workers Union
[16:46:10] Marcus Sexton: and they are...
[16:46:12] Franz Ferdinand: Combine apologizers.
[16:46:17] Franz Ferdinand: Species Betrayers.
[16:46:28] Franz Ferdinand: Just like civil protection.
[16:46:32] Marcus Sexton: Fuck they do to get that sort of reputation?
[16:46:36] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: Alright, we can put Ethan on Wanted status, but he won't come back
[16:46:46] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: Disagree, let's do BOL.
[16:46:47] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: I'm sure he's far more than aware
[16:46:48] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: He's only suspected.
[16:46:53] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: /viewdata ethan
[16:46:53] Franz Ferdinand: They're boot lickers i guess.
[16:47:00] Franz Ferdinand: Loyalists to the Universal Union.
[16:47:06] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: There's enough to warrant arrest, he hasn't shown up at all in any ID checks
[16:47:12] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: In who knows how long
[16:47:44] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: Again, he wasn't a citizen, he was a conscript. Conscripts don't show up to ID checks. He's already wanted dead.
[16:47:45] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: With Dimitri, we can warrant the arrest of Ethan on the grounds of not showing up to ID checks, he knows he's in a position where he's not coming back
[16:47:47] Marcus Sexton: That's it? Mate you're a mongoloid all they probably do is say some half-hearted oath in a room and then they get the free shite
[16:47:59] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: There's no point to BOL him if he's a conscript
[16:48:11] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: He's deserted, he'd be automatically ID'd
[16:48:17] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: /viewdata ethan
[16:48:20] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: If he was to step foot into the city
[16:48:29] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: The outlands is his only option
[16:48:31] Franz Ferdinand: that's not very nice to call me amongoloid.
[16:48:42] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: He'd be stupid enough to try
[16:48:43] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: Right.
[16:49:01] Marcus Sexton: Well I'm sorry if I hurt your fellings
[16:49:09] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: Still, if we can link these two, one, it's great for both of us, because we're working this case, two, we'd be catching someone who has long flown under our radar.
[16:49:17] CCA.C08-HELIX.i2.64998: Think that is all?
[16:49:20] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: Think so.
[16:49:21] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: Ethan's in the Outlands, we can warrant the arrest
[16:49:23] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: I marked him as being under suspicion of engaging in anti-civil activity.
[16:49:24] CCA.C08-HELIX.i2.64998: Righty.
[16:49:31] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: right, that's understood.
[16:49:32] CCA.C08-HELIX.i2.64998: Hovv you been?
[16:49:33] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: He's already wanted.
[16:49:37] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: Pretty okay.
[16:49:38] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: We don't know that Dustin is Ethan.
[16:49:39] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: You?
[16:49:49] CCA.C08-HELIX.i2.64998: Alright, just got on-duty a bit ago.
[16:49:54] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: Ah.
[16:49:54] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: There are a lot of people in the outlands, and even more in the city.
[16:49:56] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: You're warranting that Dustin is Ethan King?
[16:49:58] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: Ive been on duty all day.
[16:50:02] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: I'm saying I suspect it.
[16:50:04] Client "Athena" connected.
[16:50:04] CCA.C08-HELIX.i2.64998: Really?
[16:50:12] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: I can't confirm, but I suspect it.
[16:50:12] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: Yeah
[16:50:13] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: Well far as I know I've never heard of any Dustin
[16:50:13] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: haha
[16:50:17] CCA.C08-HELIX.i2.64998: Bet a promotion vvill come for you soon.
[16:50:21] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: Maybe
[16:50:24] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: You just transferred in, didn't you?
[16:50:26] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: Hey, HELIX
[16:50:27] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: About a week ago?
[16:50:32] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: Correct
[16:50:32] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: Do you do unionwashing or is that the higher ranks?
[16:50:37] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: That's why.
[16:50:47] CCA.C08-HELIX.i2.64998: i2s get SOME unionwashing, only a little.
[16:50:50] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: Did you get my radio messages explaining why I think this?
[16:50:50] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: And now I got a stick up my alley to investigate the infiltrator
[16:50:53] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: I meant.
[16:50:59] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: Do you actually carry out the procedure
[16:51:04] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: Right.
[16:51:07] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: I saw
[16:51:07] CCA.C08-HELIX.i2.64998: I can, but I was never told how.
[16:51:12] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: Oh.
[16:51:19] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: But what you're implying is on a grand scale potentially
[16:51:20] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: .// i need to go brb for a while
[16:51:22] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: .// food

[16:51:29] CCA.C08-HELIX.i2.64998: /looc Enjoy the food and such.
[16:51:32] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: If it concludes that this desertion isn't an isolated incident
[16:51:33] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: .// danke
[16:51:33] CCA.C08-HELIX.i2.64998: /looc Okie.
[16:51:34] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: Grand scale? It's one defector.
[16:51:38] Client "Athena" spawned in server <STEAM_0:1:446596347> (took 94 seconds).
[16:51:43] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: And if it got to more?
[16:51:43] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: Are you listening to me? He was never unionwashed.
[16:51:50] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: How the fuck was he not?
[16:52:00] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: Someone's going to be held responsible, Judge.
[16:52:05] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: /radio Unit is going temporarily 10-7 for rations. Returning to Nexus. // eating irl
[16:52:12] CCA.C08-HELIX.i2.64998: /r 10-4.
[16:52:16] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: Okay, but somebody needs to face justice.
[16:52:28] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: If they fail the Combine, they deserve to be held responsible.
[16:52:39] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: If we can find them, which they won't be in the city anymore
[16:52:45] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: Only Overwatch can find them now
[16:52:52] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: Okay? That matters why?
[16:53:00] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: /toggleraise
[16:53:01] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: My point is, we have something possible huge.
[16:53:03] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: All we can do is make sure their words doesn't spread to others in the city
[16:53:05] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: This is a good thing for us to catch.
[16:53:08] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: /toggleraise
[16:53:14] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: You realize what we are, right?
[16:53:17] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: We're JUDGE units.
[16:53:23] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: Hey, you.
[16:53:32] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: Hey, you.
[16:53:37] Marcus Sexton: Aye?
[16:53:37] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: Correct, but that doesn't mean we can catch them ourselves in the Outlands if they're to be out there
[16:53:41] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: What separates us from UNION is that we work to stop anti-civil activity before it happens.
[16:53:47] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: Who says we're going to the outlands?
[16:53:49] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: If there's more people, we need to find them
[16:53:51] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: I never said you and I are going to the outlands.
[16:53:57] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: /me digs around in the satchel on his waist, pulling out a fresh civilian filter and offering it to the citizen
[16:54:00] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: I never even implied that.
[16:54:00] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: I found this somewhere.
[16:54:03] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: They might have people in the city working for them
[16:54:06] Marcus Sexton: Well thats nice
[16:54:08] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: Right.
[16:54:09] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: Yep.
[16:54:10] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: That's relevant, how?
[16:54:12] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: We need to find that associate
[16:54:15] Marcus Sexton: Wait up
[16:54:15] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: Duh.
[16:54:22] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: If we don't know that associate, they're still here
[16:54:23] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: I think you're missing the point of what I'm saying.
[16:54:23] Marcus Sexton: Oi mate, one thing!
[16:54:27] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: hm?
[16:54:35] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: And downright possibly didn't even listen.
[16:54:40] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: I know what you're saying, Judge. My point is however is I want the head off the snake
[16:54:40] Marcus Sexton: During that ration announcment. Whats that union that gets some sorta priority?
[16:54:46] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: Civil Workers.
[16:54:56] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: You can apply once you get 10 Loyalist Points.
[16:54:58] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: I know Dimitri infiltrated this Nexus no doubt about it
[16:55:02] Marcus Sexton: I've been told their name, but what actually are they?
[16:55:03] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: You clearly don't. I just wanted to tell you about a potential development in this case.
[16:55:05] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: Or was it 5.
[16:55:09] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: I think its 5.
[16:55:12] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: That's it.
[16:55:14] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: That's all I wanted to do.
[16:55:19] CCA.C08-HELIX.i2.64998: Pretty sure it is five.
[16:55:33] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: Watch your tone, let me know if this informant tells us anything else.
[16:55:35] Marcus Sexton: Wits a Loyalty Point? Some fancy "good boy system"
[16:55:46] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: Right. I'll keep working on *my* case.
[16:55:47] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: They're our workers within the city. They handle commerce, shops and stuff
[16:56:00] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: As well as industry like metalworking and repairs
[16:56:01] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743 to admins: You have serious balls to try an EpU
[16:56:10] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: Bonuses come with applying for it.
[16:56:11] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: You're going back.
[16:56:13] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: We need two things from you.
[16:56:15] Marcus Sexton: So they run corner-shops and get benifits alongside that
[16:56:17] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: The name of the associate.
[16:56:20] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: Yep, basically.
[16:56:23] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: Or any other associates.
[16:56:30] Marcus Sexton: Aye that sounds like a good deal
[16:56:34] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: And then we need to know how to get in that secret door.
[16:56:34] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.39867: Sure is.
[16:56:35] CCA.C08-JUDGE.i3.10852: Got it?
[16:56:49] Merissa Myers: Can't you use metal detectors or something?

[17:56:07] Erwin Ramstein: Agh.. I'm afraid not.. I'm assuming he's a general manager of sorts. He's the one who got me into CWU.

[17:56:15] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: Thank you
[17:56:19] Erwin Ramstein: No problem.
[17:56:21] Selena Kuznetsov: Yeah. You're selling a beanie for 30 tokens?
[17:56:26] Selena Kuznetsov: And then a shirt for 35?
[17:56:40] Selena Kuznetsov: I don't see the logistics in that, sir.
[17:56:40] Erwin Ramstein: Yep, CWU has baseline prices they constrict both minimum and maximum.

[17:57:05] Erwin Ramstein: The Shirt and the Beanie are both Knit, some by hand by myself and then stamped with CWU, Union Logos and the sorts.

[17:57:17] Erwin Ramstein: I don't want to make a shirt wildly more expensive, and my goal isn't profit.

[17:57:32] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: /me peers over to the corner, then stepping back
[17:57:33] Selena Kuznetsov: But why are they essentially the same price? Thirty tokens is a hefty price for a single beanie.
[17:57:36] Erwin Ramstein: Prices rise the longer that Civilians stay within the City.
[17:57:50] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: ugh
[17:57:52] CCA.C08-JUDGE.EpU.35743: stomach
[17:57:57] Erwin Ramstein: Thirty Tokens is easily affordable with how frequent Rations, Workshifts and Work Tables are; for those who cannot afford I easily lower prices.
