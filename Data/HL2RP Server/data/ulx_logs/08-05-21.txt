[13:36:31] Raymon Kalachya: // It does. She's 19 in Alyx, HL Alyx takes place 5 years before Half Life. Hence making her 24 during HL2. 1996, her birthdate, + 24, equals 2020

[13:37:56] Raymon Kalachya: // It literally says in Half Life Alyx that she is 19 at the time and that Half Life Alyx takes place 5 years before the Citadel collapsed(Events of Half Life 2)

[13:40:29] Raymon Kalachya: // Yes

[13:42:55] Raymon Kalachya: // Half Life 2 doesn't fuck with Space and Time all that much. The only time jump is when Gordo nand Alyx teleport from Nova Prospekt to Kleiner's lab

[13:50:03] Lee Maylor: //i think 19
[13:50:11] Raymon Kalachya: // 19 yeah
[13:50:24] Lee Maylor: //so if we know she was born, we can use basic arithmetic to figure out when half-life 2 happens
[13:50:35] Lee Maylor: //because we know HL:A happens 5 years before HL2

[14:12:20] Lee Maylor: //no, he can't.
[14:12:21] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: // with supervision
[14:12:22] The Man Who Was.: // Nope, I can't.
[14:12:28] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: // damn thats kinda P2W
[14:12:28] The Man Who Was.: // I can answer for myself.
[14:12:33] The Man Who Was.: // But, yeah. No dice.
[14:12:38] Raymon Kalachya: // I jsut wanted it for like 15-30 mins for building but making people pay is kinda a douchey thing to do. Oh well
[14:12:45] Alicia Merii: // he has to pay for 15 min pet flags
[14:12:47] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: // i thought this server was supposed to stray away from that ideal...
[14:12:53] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: // oh well
[14:12:55] The Man Who Was.: // He'd have to pay to have PET permanently on any char.
[14:12:55] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon: // not my call
[14:12:58] The Man Who Was.: // Not just for 15 mins.
[14:13:04] The Man Who Was.: // But I can't give it temp.
[14:13:08] Alicia Merii: // raymon, get used to paying for stuff here.......... jk jk unless?
[14:13:33] Lee Maylor: //sorry to hera you think its' docuhey. that policy may change relatively soon, but at the moment, we need to pay for hosting somehow.
[14:13:45] Raymon Kalachya: // Ye ye
[14:13:48] The Man Who Was.: // I'd also set up some furniture for you but, I can't perma or do much at all.
[14:13:52] Alicia Merii: // q...
[14:13:59] Alicia Merii: // how many $ do i have to pay to create another char?
[14:14:01] The Man Who Was.: // I'm also working on Documenting 3 Seperate things right now.
[14:14:09] The Man Who Was.: // To make.. another.. Character?
[14:14:15] The Man Who Was.: // Like a Citizen?
[14:14:21] Lee Maylor: //he's being an ass
[14:14:25] The Man Who Was.: // Right.
[14:14:30] Alicia Merii: // anyways
[14:14:32] Chris 'Cyclops' LeVon<STEAM_0:1:116497963> changed their name to Jim Bostello
[14:14:34] Raymon Kalachya: // Should maybe make people pay for Pac instead of pet. Just a suggestion
[14:14:35] The Man Who Was.: // Because some Chars you *do* have to pay to make.
[14:14:37] Jim Bostello: // oh no hes been playing CCA too long
[14:14:40] Jim Bostello: // its starting to get to him
[14:14:43] The Man Who Was.: // Fuck paying for PAC lmao.
[14:14:59] Lee Maylor: //i intend on keeping pac public
[14:15:03] Jim Bostello: // pac is a donator trait?
[14:15:11] Lee Maylor: //no
[14:15:16] Lee Maylor: //i-
[14:15:17] Lee Maylor: //oh my shit
[14:15:18] Lee Maylor: //no
[14:15:21] Lee Maylor: //it's for all players
[14:15:45] Raymon Kalachya: // I've seen a PAC of a dude that said he was 6'5. The pac was like 8ft tall. JIM
[14:15:58] Jim Bostello: // not at all lol
[14:16:03] Jim Bostello: // its pretty damn realistic
[14:16:13] Alicia Merii: // blame me for showing him how the fuck pac works
[14:16:15] Lee Maylor teleported to Jim Bostello
[14:16:22] Jim Bostello: // since im not taller than doorframes and the normal height for someone whos 6'5"
[14:16:25] Jim Bostello: // its pretty realistic
[14:16:50] Raymon Kalachya: // Not really. I think the general height for male PMs is around 6ft but your pac adds like a whole Head's worth of height or more XD
[14:16:57] Jim Bostello: // also, i look bigger because the suit is *thicc* and im a *thicc, lean* man
[14:17:01] Alicia Merii: // he's american though
[14:17:03] The Man Who Was.: // Tyrone Biggums
[14:17:06] The Man Who Was.: // 9'3"
[14:17:07] Lee Maylor: //yeah compared to how tall source characters look, you look 7 feet tall
[14:17:10] The Man Who Was.: // 450 Pounds.
[14:17:18] Jim Bostello: .// your also 5'9"
[14:17:24] The Man Who Was.: // Standard Height of a Gmod Char is 5'11".
[14:17:28] The Man Who Was.: // Confirmed via PAC.
[14:17:37] Lee Maylor: //ah i thought it was exactly 2 meterts
[14:17:47] The Man Who Was.: // Nerp 5'11".
[14:17:52] Jim Bostello: // it doesnt sound like a lot but the height different is there im 6'2" irl and im to the mouth of a guy whos 6'5"
[14:17:57] Lee Maylor: .//okay but my camera is at 5'11"
[14:18:11] Lee Maylor: .//you've got a half foot on me but you look like you've got a whole foot on me
[14:18:22] Jim Bostello: .// yeah i know camera just built different
[14:18:28] Lee Maylor: .//i am 2/3 your height
[14:18:35] Raymon Kalachya: // Tbh I can respect the fact that PAC is public. Last server I was on makes you pay $50 for pac and pet with some other stuff included and the only people that had it were staff. They were like the only people with unique chars
[14:18:38] Jim Bostello: // lole lil 5'9" RAT
[14:18:42] Lee Maylor: //50 FUCKING DOLLARS?
[14:18:45] Jim Bostello: // *RAT*
[14:18:58] Raymon Kalachya: // Yeah $50 for perma and like 20-30 a month if you don't wanna do 50 right off
[14:19:00] Lee Maylor: .//i'm 2/3 of your height and my model is 5'11". You need to be shorter.
[14:19:02] Lee Maylor: //bruh
[14:19:06] Alicia Merii: // Q, you should consider coding in temporary pet flags
[14:19:08] Raymon Kalachya: // They over charged the fuck out of people
[14:19:17] Lee Maylor: .//or rather appear shorter in your pac
[14:19:20] Raymon Kalachya: // Hence why I didn't buy it
[14:19:23] Jim Bostello: .// your 5'9" dawg
[14:19:40] Lee Maylor: .//holy shit
[14:19:43] Jim Bostello: .// im pretty short for people who use pac
[14:19:46] Lee Maylor: .//i don't have any pacs enabled
[14:19:49] The Man Who Was.: // Making people pay for PAC at all is misreable.
[14:19:50] Lee Maylor: .//you are absolutely not
[14:19:55] Alicia Merii: // where the cp's at...
[14:20:06] Jim Bostello: .// i am actually the dude who tried making his height more realistic to mine set his and he was the same height as me
[14:20:12] Pogger: // GONE
[14:20:13] Lee Maylor: .//using basic math, that height is 8' tall
[14:20:13] Raymon Kalachya: // This is also the same server where got banned and had my CP whitelist taken after I PM'd a CP that was being the most non-CP like uncooperative dick ever telling him to cut the shit he was doing out
[14:20:21] Jim Bostello: // where do you get this math
[14:20:30] Lee Maylor: .//i'm 2/3 your height
[14:20:34] Lee Maylor: .//and my model is 5'11"
[14:20:41] Jim Bostello: .// no not really at all your right under my neck
[14:20:53] Lee Maylor: .//that doesn't make the fraction different man
[14:20:54] Alicia Merii: /pm pogger ya able to let me in rq
[14:20:54] Raymon Kalachya: // Talking about Aurora btw. Staff there suck absolute nuts in my opinion
[14:21:04] Lee Maylor: //rule 3
[14:21:05] Alicia Merii: // liquid owns aurora yeah?
[14:21:12] Jim Bostello: .// its realistic for someone whos as tall as a *RAT*
[14:21:17] Raymon Kalachya: // Yeah yeah my bad
[14:21:27] Alicia Merii: // let's converse that subject over notepads
[14:21:33] Alicia Merii: // as the all-seeing eye is lurking within this chat
[14:21:33] Jim Bostello: // isnt there a rule that says you cant bash servers?
[14:21:35] Raymon Kalachya: /pm alicia SOmething like that yeah
[14:21:42] Raymon Kalachya: // Yeah that would be rule 3
[14:21:49] Lee Maylor: .//jim
[14:21:50] The Man Who Was.: // That is why Rule 3 was mentioned.
[14:21:52] Lee Maylor: .//listen to me
[14:21:54] Lee Maylor: .//for shit's sake
[14:21:56] Jim Bostello: .// the tip of your head reaches my gasmask
[14:21:59] Alicia Merii: // obviously ^
[14:22:02] Lee Maylor: .//MY MODEL. IS 5'11". I DON'T HAVE PAC ENABLED
[14:22:03] Lee Maylor: .//YOU ARE TOO TALL.
[14:22:04] Raymon Kalachya: // Basicaly all I'm saying is that I left aurora because of staff issues and came her with hopes that it'd be better
[14:22:04] Lee Maylor: .//FIX IT.
[14:22:08] Lee Maylor: .//Got it?
[14:22:12] Jim Bostello: .// im not too tall tho 
[14:22:18] Jim Bostello: .// the dude literally is the same height as me
[14:22:19] Alicia Merii: /pm raymon imo its a gamble whether it's better
[14:22:21] The Man Who Was.: // Are having some issues with PAC? Let me handle it
[14:22:22] Lee Maylor: .//Do you want me to take away your pac privileges?
[14:22:26] The Man Who Was.: // Jim, what is your IC Height.
[14:22:28] Alicia Merii: /pm raymon consider this a half cooked salmon
[14:22:32] Jim Bostello: .// 6'5
[14:22:35] Jim Bostello: // 6'5
[14:22:40] The Man Who Was.: // What is your PAC Scale.
[14:22:42] Jim Bostello: // bring him here and we'll compare size
[14:22:42] Lee Maylor: .//Say one more thing and I'll remove your pac privileges.
[14:22:46] Lee Maylor: .//Fix it.
[14:22:50] The Man Who Was.: // Jim, just tell me your PAC Scale.
[14:23:02] Jim Bostello: .// fineeee ill bring it back down to .19
[14:23:09] Raymon Kalachya: /pm alicia yeah it's getting it's kinks fixed but I'd rather be in a Work In Progress server than a server where the staff punish people for literally anything
[14:23:11] Alicia Merii: // if i remember correctly its roughly around 1.15 or something, unsure
[14:23:17] Lee Maylor: //well he's bringing it down to 1.19 now so
[14:23:19] Lee Maylor: //incredibly high
[14:23:20] Lee Maylor: .//Thank you.
[14:23:30] The Man Who Was.: // Okay, can I get an answer. From *Jim*
[14:23:31] Alicia Merii: // dont blame me for teaching him pac
[14:23:35] The Man Who Was.: // What is your Scale Height, Jim.
[14:23:44] Alicia Merii: // also for his IC height just look at his description
[14:23:46] Jim Bostello: // its .19, which is fine
[14:23:55] Alicia Merii: // .19's fine imo
[14:23:56] The Man Who Was.: // I know his IC Height I am asking for his scale height.
[14:23:58] The Man Who Was.: // 1.19?
[14:24:04] Lee Maylor: //he said he would bring it down to 1.19
[14:24:08] Lee Maylor: //so he was taller than that
[14:24:09] Jim Bostello: // 1.19 isnt that much taller than .13
[14:24:16] Lee Maylor: //but he's still the same scale
[14:24:17] The Man Who Was.: // Okay, well allow me to inform you that from the PAC Scale Height, a logistical website I've used and every single Advanced PAC User References.
[14:24:20] The Man Who Was.: // 1.069 is 6'5"
[14:24:21] Jim Bostello: // my scale is 0 0 0 
[14:24:22] The Man Who Was.: // So change it.
[14:24:27] The Man Who Was.: // Thank you.
[14:24:32] Alicia Merii: // jesus fucking christ
[14:24:36] Alicia Merii: // we got fucking einstein over here...
[14:24:40] Jim Bostello: // how is .69 6'5 LMFAO
[14:24:45] Lee Maylor: //0.69
[14:24:46] The Man Who Was.: // Not .69
[14:24:47] Alicia Merii: // also 69
[14:24:49] Lee Maylor: //0.069*
[14:24:51] The Man Who Was.: // .069, is 6'5"
[14:24:52] The Man Who Was.: // 1.069
[14:24:54] The Man Who Was.: // Set it, please.
[14:24:57] Lee Maylor: //jim, fix it, or you're losing pac. last chance.
[14:25:04] Alicia Merii: /pm jim looool
[14:25:12] Alicia Merii: /pm jim this shit is waaack
[14:25:12] The Man Who Was.: // Your current height is 6'9" if you keep it where it's as.
[14:25:20] The Man Who Was.: // Which makes complete sense looking at you.
[14:25:27] Jim Bostello: // bruh nuhuh 1.069 is definitely not 6'5"
[14:25:29] The Man Who Was.: // So either becoming 6'9" or scale to 1.069
[14:25:31] Jim Bostello: // in the slightest bit
[14:25:35] Lee Maylor: //got it. You're losing pac.
[14:25:38] The Man Who Was.: // I'm not going to further reinforce my point Jim lmao
[14:25:40] Alicia Merii: // lol
[14:25:47] Jim Bostello: // doesnt make sense
[14:25:47] The Man Who Was.: // People have used it as a reference for Years.
[14:25:49] Alicia Merii: // jim, enjoy your 50 year ban for going against staff wishes.....
[14:25:51] The Man Who Was.: // https://sevilidan.boards.net/thread/526/pac3-height-guide

[14:25:57] Alicia Merii: // years?
[14:25:58] Lee Maylor: //i'm just handling it
[14:25:59] Alicia Merii: // i gotta check that out
[14:26:08] The Man Who Was.: // Surely, use it as a reference if you'd like.
[14:26:11] Alicia Merii: // because pac does get updated over the years.
[14:26:30] Jim Bostello: // then why is yung buck using 1.13
[14:26:34] Jim Bostello: // hes only 6'1
[14:26:44] The Man Who Was.: // Why are you pushing blame to others?
[14:26:46] The Man Who Was.: // Make a report.
[14:26:53] Jim Bostello: // deal with it 
[14:26:55] Alicia Merii: // cope
[14:27:00] Lee Maylor muted Jim Bostello
[14:27:08] The Man Who Was.: // Coping just fine, don't switch the blame.
[14:27:13] Alicia Merii: // was talking to jim ye nut

[14:28:08] Lee Maylor: //i muted him for a moment just to have him drop the sobject
[14:28:08] The Man Who Was.: // Alrighty I guess lmao.
[14:28:14] Lee Maylor: //subject*
[14:28:17] The Man Who Was.: // Right, okay. So we're done; cool.
[14:28:22] Alicia Merii: // he wont drop it p sure

[14:28:39] Lee Maylor: //if he doesn't he's going away for 24 hours
[14:28:43] Raymon Kalachya: // Certified Bruh moment
[14:28:44] Jim Bostello: // thats all im sayin
[14:28:58] Alicia Merii: // imo this is the kinda shit that does drive away players
[14:29:03] Jim Bostello: // you threaten to ban over height?
[14:29:06] Jim Bostello: // wtf?
[14:29:11] Jim Bostello: // what happened to this server?
[14:29:14] The Man Who Was.: // Having.. Realistic PAC Scaling.. Drives.. Players away?
[14:29:16] Lee Maylor banned Jim Bostello for 1 day (I told you to drop it. You didn't drop it. See you tomorrow.)
[14:29:16] Dropped "Jim Bostello" from server<STEAM_0:1:116497963>
[14:29:21] The Man Who Was.: // ...Right.
[14:29:23] Alicia Merii: // when did i say that ya fuckin numbskull
[14:29:31] Alicia Merii: // i'm talking overall
[14:29:33] Raymon Kalachya: // Welp. That's that
[14:29:34] Lee Maylor: //alicia, don't talk to people like that here
[14:29:50] The Man Who Was.: // Lmao. Oh well, he should've just changed his height to 7'0".
[14:29:54] Raymon Kalachya: // Can the CPs come out to be our LP generators. I wanna frickin join the CWU
[14:29:55] The Man Who Was.: // Then he'd be good.
[14:30:05] Lee Maylor: //yeah, somebody flag up. i be writing
[14:30:08] The Man Who Was.: // You still haven't gotten any jobs?
[14:30:28] Raymon Kalachya: // Nope
[14:30:29] The Man Who Was.: // Both the talks I had about Staff Autonomy and CCA doing things seem to be going...
[14:30:33] The Man Who Was.: // *Just Great.*
[14:30:45] Lee Maylor: //then flag up
[14:30:59] The Man Who Was.: // *I dont have a CCA and I agreed to not have one, it's not my responsibility as I don't have a CCA.*
[14:31:19] Alicia Merii: // though you two staff members gotta agree that was dramatic as fuck
[14:31:22] The Man Who Was.: // And I'd also like to remind you I'm revising a Document and making two others.
[14:31:28] Lee Maylor: //it was more dramatic than it had to be, yeah
[14:31:39] The Man Who Was.: // If he made himself 7 feet tall it'd be funny.
[14:31:42] The Man Who Was.: // And I'd drop it.
[14:31:56] Alicia Merii: // that's the opposite of what staff should do?
[14:32:02] Alicia Merii: // dropping something over it being funny?
[14:32:10] The Man Who Was.: // It'd be funny, and it'd be correct.
[14:32:18] The Man Who Was.: // If you couldn't imply that, then oh well.
[14:32:23] Raymon Kalachya: // XYZ coulda dropped it but he didn't. What he was trying to do made no sense to me. He's 6'5 irp but 7ft in pac? Refuses to do either things he could've done to resolve the issue. Makes 0 sense 
[14:32:24] Alicia Merii: // the height wouldn't be correct though
[14:32:43] The Man Who Was.: // The height would be correct the scale he was at was Seven Feet Tall.
[14:32:55] The Man Who Was.: // So if he made his Description, Seven Feet Tall, he'd be correct.
[14:33:00] The Man Who Was.: // Do I have to explain this further?
[14:33:04] Alicia Merii: // the scale is a schmale
[14:33:11] Lee Maylor: //No, let's just drop it. That's easy.
[14:33:27] Raymon Kalachya: // If he wanted to be 6ft tall irp then why not scale his shit down? If he wanted to be that height visually, why wouldn't he change his desc to 7ft? Just being stubborn for no reason
[14:33:31] Alicia Merii: // if you want it to be immersive then maybe compare it to how tall that is irl?
[14:33:31] The Man Who Was.: // So I'm going to go back to making multiple documents.
[14:33:36] Lee Maylor: //i'm going to do that too
[14:33:40] The Man Who Was.: // Hope the things I spoke for hours on end about actually get listened too.
[14:33:45] The Man Who Was.: // Especially Staff wise, one can hope.
[14:34:07] Raymon Kalachya: // No CP LP generator smh why live
[14:34:08] Pogger: // if they dont listen to you they will perish
[14:34:15] Lee Maylor: //solar ho pon CCA
[14:34:39] Alicia Merii: // imagine forcing someone to hop onto CCA
[14:34:43] Alicia Merii: // sheeeeeeee
[14:34:50] Raymon Kalachya: // Well. That's how most RP servers do it
[14:35:15] Raymon Kalachya: // Even on FiveM and shit. When their aren't enough COps on, they force literally everyone with the ability to be cop to get on
[14:35:39] Raymon Kalachya: // It's basically the same here except not on as much of a grand scale
