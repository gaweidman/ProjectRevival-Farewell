[21:09:19] Elizabeth Skülberg: // i was happy to have them
[21:09:32] John Zimmer: Officer
[21:09:39] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: hm?
[21:09:56] John Zimmer: I have some unfortunate news about some ota, and some contraband to turn in that I secured from their bodies.
[21:10:01] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Hm
[21:10:11] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Hold that thought
[21:10:15] John Zimmer: Alright.
[21:10:20] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: It involves OTA?
[21:10:26] Evan Miller: /pm epu remember you would hardly bleieve this shit because no idea what happen
[21:10:31] John Zimmer: Yes, two OTA died to feral xenobe.
[21:10:32] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: /reply I know
[21:10:38] Evan Miller: /pm epu figured you knew
[21:10:44] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Hm
[21:11:00] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Your telling me two OTA died to Xenobies and you lived?
[21:11:11] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Or what?
[21:11:35] John Zimmer: Actually wait no, only one died, and left me to get help, but I never saw him return
[21:11:44] John Zimmer: I eventually made my way back
[21:11:52] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: How?
[21:12:08] John Zimmer: I climbed my way back onto a platform.
[21:12:17] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: /me Simply ignores the second civvie trying to say whatever the fuck she's trying to say
[21:12:33] Elizabeth Skülberg: /looc is Civvie or Civie?
[21:12:33] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: And when did this happen?
[21:12:55] John Zimmer: Maybe a few hours ago, but there were no officers to report it to at the time.
[21:12:56] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: .// civvie is the short word for civilians even though I expected it to be civie.
[21:13:47] John Zimmer: Ma'am, please this is a very serious report I must give, if you could excuse us for a moment.
[21:13:52] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Alright....and where did this allegedly happen?
[21:14:03] John Zimmer: At the quarentine one during a shift they gave us.
[21:14:09] John Zimmer: /looc zone*
[21:14:29] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Hm....the QZ.....did you get a Haz mat suit?
[21:14:48] John Zimmer: Yes, that's one of the contraband that I was going to return as it was never retrieved.
[21:14:53] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Show me it
[21:15:01] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Hm
[21:15:02] John Zimmer: There's the hazmat
[21:15:03] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: I see
[21:15:10] John Zimmer: And I have a regular factory one
[21:15:20] John Zimmer: These are some things he dropped.
[21:15:26] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Alright......in what condition was the OTA in at the time?
[21:15:35] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: And wasn't he reporting it in?
[21:15:43] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: civvie beat it
[21:15:53] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Move it
[21:15:58] John Zimmer: He was, but the other OTA avaliable died, after I tried to help him
[21:16:03] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: I see
[21:16:32] Elizabeth Skülberg: // which ranks in the CCA can defunct lower ranks?
[21:16:39] John Zimmer: I did all I could to keep him alive, to the point of killing xenobes, so at least I had him for a witness to this.
[21:16:51] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: I see
[21:17:03] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: And what condition was this OTA in?
[21:17:24] John Zimmer: Poor, he was having what it seemed to be hotflashes, and he was extremely dehydrated.
[21:17:28] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Hm
[21:17:39] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Anything else to report?
[21:17:56] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Afterwhich i'll give you your LP
[21:18:06] Evan Miller: /charsetmodel eric models/gman.mdl
[21:18:12] Evan Miller: /charsetmodel evan models/gman.mdl
[21:18:16] John Zimmer: The OTA that died, because he cut the magnet crane wire, so you might need to fix that.
[21:18:22] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: I see
[21:18:26] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: It will be checked out
[21:18:32] John Zimmer: Thank you.
[21:19:03] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Now then, come with me. If what you have said is true then this is bigger than you think. Especially if a OTA was in such a condition for no reason.
[21:19:19] John Zimmer: I believe it vvas due to the xeno's
[21:19:32] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: How do you know?
[21:19:33] John Zimmer: They made weird orbs of light that could have caused it.
[21:19:39] John Zimmer: Then attacked us.
[21:19:42] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Hm
[21:19:46] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: I see
[21:20:10] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: /radio Unit to ECHO, did you start any workcycles involving the QZ?
[21:20:26] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Alright, resume following me
[21:20:42] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: // Q i need you to answer that by the way
[21:20:55] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Wait a moment
[21:20:58] Evan Miller<STEAM_0:1:53097688> changed their name to OTA.C14-ECHO:1-30512
[21:21:15] John Zimmer: What?
[21:21:22] OTA.C14-ECHO:1-30512: /radio Affirmative.
[21:21:28] John Zimmer: Are you ok?
[21:21:40] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: /radio Was one ECHIO units biosignal lost during it?
[21:21:45] OTA.C14-ECHO:1-30512: Affirmative.
[21:21:46] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: /radio ECHO*
[21:21:48] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Hm
[21:22:00] OTA.C14-ECHO:1-30512: Only one.
[21:22:04] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: I see
[21:22:18] John Zimmer: Ma'am I have no idea what you're talking about
[21:22:35] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: A 10-91 reported that he survived the incident and one of the ECHO units was in bad shape. He was very dehydrated allegedly
[21:22:40] OTA.C14-ECHO:1-30512: hm
[21:22:43] OTA.C14-ECHO:1-30512: Interesting.
[21:22:44] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: With hot-flashes
[21:22:47] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: I doubt it
[21:22:54] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: But he did turn in the Haz-mat suit
[21:23:02] John Zimmer: Ma'am could you please leave me be
[21:23:12] John Zimmer: /looc i can't hear half of what you're saying cause im in discord
[21:23:17] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: I've got him outside if you want to talk to him
[21:23:20] OTA.C14-ECHO:1-30512: Interesting. I'm no JUDGE, but I would imagine an anti-citizen wouldn't turn in the contraband.
[21:23:21] Elizabeth Skülberg: Leave yo to be what?
[21:23:29] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: I know, it's hard to say if it's true
[21:23:30] Client "[CGN] Painevan" connected.
[21:23:39] OTA.C14-ECHO:1-30512: So you're doubting... what?
[21:23:40] John Zimmer: Alone
[21:23:42] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Both were attacked by Xenobes as well.
[21:24:26] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: But......i've never heard of a ECHO unit getting really thirsty for no real reason. Especially hot-flashes? and considering the 10-91 himself is unscaved it's impressive to me
[21:24:52] OTA.C14-ECHO:1-30512: There were two that went, right?
[21:24:55] OTA.C14-ECHO:1-30512: And one died?
[21:24:59] OTA.C14-ECHO:1-30512: Talk to the living one.
[21:25:22] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: In that kind of situation it would be difficult to be unscaved. Also the unit should have reported it....fair....I can try to speak with him if he's still around

[22:50:25] John Zimmer: It should be easy to avoid the cams, since there are only a few at the entrance
[22:50:29] Journey Robertson: "Possible" I'll have to scout around and see any possible other ideas.
[22:50:39] Journey Robertson: the issue is the Units patroling around
