[15:48:40] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: fucking bad
[15:48:41] James Albright: fragger is better but not in the sense that it's good
[15:48:41] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Why would you want to look like a metal album but as a CCA unit
[15:48:46] James Albright: just that it's less bad
[15:48:56] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: i like biopolice
[15:49:01] James Albright: biopolice is cool]
[15:49:17] James Albright: see my favorite HD redux mask isn't ni the metropolice pack
[15:49:21] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: This would be so much easier if we just gave up on diversity and used the HL:A models but I get why
[15:49:25] James Albright: it's in the additional metropolice pack
[15:49:30] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Let us see

[15:50:41] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: // ok
[15:50:43] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: At one point on a server the city was overtaken by another Combine faction and we had to use only Rogue cop models
[15:50:55] James Albright: ew
[15:51:05] James Albright: also what
[15:51:14] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: And we HAD to be edgy as well. The actual story was fucking amazing but the fact that we had to use a edgy model was dumb
[15:51:26] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: the story doesnt sound amazin gf
[15:51:35] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: if another "combine faction" took over the city

[15:52:25] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: I personally like the idea of a seperate faction using only Human units and not tanshuman. Of course we had a lot of events where we had Real Combine troops flooding the city and shit but it was pretty neato
[15:52:41] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: .// Transhuman*

[15:54:25] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Because the Combine think we care about money 
[15:56:17] James Albright: yeah i need to enrf salry

[16:02:10] Gregory Smith: Affirmative
[16:02:12] James Albright: //wherein, the AR2 was actually the OICW

[16:03:42] Gregory Smith: Hello
[16:04:02] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: This citizen over here, Gregory Smith, walked up to me with eight loyalist points a few days ago. However, it wasn't noted down how he recieved them.
[16:04:10] James Albright: //there are quite a few remnants of the  beta in the retail HL2 release files actually
[16:04:15] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: If you would like to check his data, I noted everything down.
[16:04:19] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: I saw
[16:04:24] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: Great.
[16:04:34] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: And i'll have to speak with the JUDGE OfC on the JUDGE unit who did it
[16:04:40] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: Oh, I see.
[16:04:45] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: But
[16:04:59] James Albright: /doorsethidden true
[16:05:00] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: Well, he was asking if his points could go back to eight, I think.
[16:05:07] James Albright: //there's a folder in the game files referring to the combine assassin
[16:05:19] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: I put it down to four because he shouldn't have gotten 3 for a workdesk task.
[16:05:19] James Albright: //it has one sound in it, ball_zap.mp3
[16:05:22] James Albright: //or as you all know it
[16:05:22] James Albright: //this
[16:05:42] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: And that's still being quite generous, I believe.
[16:05:42] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: No he shouldn't have. The most you should ever give is two and thats for a harder job
[16:05:43] Gregory Smith: Now i have 6 Points
[16:05:45] James Albright: //they also have the directory waste_scanner still in the sounds folder

[16:06:36] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: I thought you only recieved one point for reporting a petty crime?
[16:06:38] James Albright: //the cguard folder
[16:06:43] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: Not to mention it wasn't really a petty crime, it was a broken window.

[16:06:50] James Albright: //irifle
[16:06:52] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Just a broken window?
[16:06:52] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: In a rundown apartment, he says.
[16:06:54] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: Yep
[16:07:04] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Thats being generous even giving him-
[16:07:09] Gregory Smith: /me puts his ID back in his pocket
[16:07:10] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: // Oh OOC
[16:07:13] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: I put it in as one.
[16:07:19] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: // Void me stopping my sentence
[16:07:19] James Albright: //well i guess the tau cannon is on the jeep so thats' why its there but
[16:07:21] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: But someone must have changed it.
[16:07:37] James Albright: //in fact, the cguard file is something you already know
[16:07:37] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: One is even being generous for a random window
[16:07:37] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: Wait, no.
[16:07:41] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: I'm being forgetful.
[16:07:46] James Albright: //it's the sound of the strider cannon charging
[16:07:49] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: Let me think, hold on.
[16:07:54] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: /me rubs on the forehead of his mask, before sighing
[16:07:59] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: /me looks back up at the EpU
[16:08:15] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: I gave him two loyalist points for reporting a petty crime, being generous and going off the handbook.
[16:08:23] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: I see
[16:08:26] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: Two, one each for the workdesk tasks he said he did.
[16:08:35] James Albright: //anyfuckinways
[16:08:46] James Albright: //i'm gonna work on the ota guidef now
[16:08:49] James Albright: //do some finishing touches
[16:08:51] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: // Good
[16:08:52] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: And then one more later, for doing another workdesk task.
[16:08:58] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: So he had 5.
[16:09:10] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: And then one was given to him for picking up xenian meat, by someone.
[16:09:13] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: So yeah, it correlates.
[16:09:18] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: He has 6 now, as he says
[16:09:23] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Exactly
[16:09:43] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: So i don't really see the problem here. If he wants eight then he'll have to do some extra work, simple
[16:09:54] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.39867: Alright, I was just confirming.
[16:09:58] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Good
[16:09:58] Gregory Smith: So, can you give me a work then?
[16:10:01] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Fine
