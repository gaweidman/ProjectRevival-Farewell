[16:47:00] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: Have you done a work cycle before?
[16:47:04] CCA.C08-RCT.81580: Negative
[16:47:15] CCA.C08-RCT.81580: Just work desks
[16:47:20] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: Alright.
[16:47:26] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: As of right now, they have two options.
[16:47:36] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: I'll explain to the citizen, you just watch and PAY ATTENTION.
[16:47:43] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: Alright, you have two options.
[16:47:47] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: Refining metal or refining electronics.
[16:48:05] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: Refining metal is slower but pays more, refining electronics is faster but it pay less.
[16:48:16] Ethan King to admins: Hey Q, is the radio in the funny Bunker broken?
[16:48:27] Grasshopper teleported to Ethan King
[16:48:28] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: /pm king too many things on mnid ask later
[16:48:31] Ethan King: /reply Alright
[16:48:38] Grasshopper: .// what radio
[16:48:46] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: Refining metal, you take charred metal from the work cycle supply.
[16:49:02] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: You put it in the forge. That's the metal tube machine here.
[16:49:10] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: This here is the forge.
[16:49:16] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: You load up the charred metal and melt it down.
[16:49:23] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: Make sure you grab blacksmith tongs from the supply as well.
[16:49:40] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: Once it's all melted, pull out all the metal that doesn't look gross.
[16:49:46] Ethan King: .// This one
[16:49:58] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: You'll see what I mean. If it's got weird specks or whatever else in it that the other metal doesn't, you don't want to take out that metal.
[16:50:07] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: You'll get scrap metal, then you repeat the process of refining until you have refined metal.
[16:50:08] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: got it?
[16:50:17] Grasshopper: .// huh
[16:50:23] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: It's like triple filtering filter but with liquid metal.
[16:50:23] Grasshopper: .// no clue

[16:50:45] Ethan King: .// I was told by Razor or whatever his name was that it got destroyed during a radi.
[16:50:47] Ethan King: .// raid*
[16:51:02] Ethan King: .// But due to it still being here I need Q to confirm that.
[16:51:13] Raymon Kalachya: I'm kind of confused about the part with specks
[16:51:15] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: .//i'll describe how to actually make the inventory item as well
[16:51:20] Ethan King: .// But he has shit on his mind so whatever.
[16:51:21] CCA.C08-RCT.81580: // Noone else working ? Wierd fellas here.
[16:51:25] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: Alright, so you get charred metal. It's this burnt up looking stuff.
[16:51:29] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: //Right, that's why we called a miscout.
[16:51:38] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: //i'll explain to you how we get those and shit
[16:51:48] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: You put it in the forge, melt it down. You get that part.
[16:51:52] Raymon Kalachya: Yes
[16:52:09] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: When you look at the liquid metal, you'll see that you have clean looking liquid metal, and liquid metal that doesn't look clean.
[16:52:41] CCA.C08-RCT.81580: impure.... Cough
[16:52:43] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: So if it just looks orange and has nothing else really to it, you pick it out.
[16:53:02] Client "Dilly_" spawned in server <STEAM_0:0:52468151> (took 147 seconds).
[16:53:22] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: But if you see a bunch of black... stuff, floating around in it, that's the stuff you don't want to take out. That's the stuff you drain out.
[16:53:30] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: Does that make any more sense?
[16:53:36] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: If not, I can provide a visual demonstration.
[16:53:37] Frank Jackson: Nice suit.
[16:53:42] Francis Zuckanbi: /looc oh i still have it?
[16:53:44] Frank Jackson: [[ yup
[16:53:48] Francis Zuckanbi: /looc that was alicia's suit but i suicided with her
[16:53:51] CCA.C08-RCT.81580: /looc He died :D
[16:53:52] Raymon Kalachya: No no. I understand it now officer

[16:54:05] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: Alright.
[16:54:10] CCA.C08-RCT.81580: I would say Practice is the best way how to learn
[16:54:11] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: Then you do that over and over until the metal is fully refined.
[16:54:18] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: And I would say I never asked for your input.
[16:54:25] Frank Jackson: /me takes a deep breath, and looks up to the starry sky.

[16:54:39] Francis Zuckanbi: /pm grass ima just steal my suit back bc fuck
[16:54:59] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: You'll find scrap electronics in the same supply.
[16:55:15] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: You just pick through the scraps and set aside the parts that look broken.
[16:55:37] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: At the end of the process, you will have refined electronics.
[16:55:43] Raymon Kalachya: Okay. That's all I really need to know otehr than this. Which of these is most beneficial to the Union?
[16:56:02] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: Doesn't really matter, we need both.
[16:56:13] Raymon Kalachya: Alright. What do you recommend?
[16:56:15] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: Not done with the explanation, don't interrupt me again.

[17:55:56] CCA.C08-RCT.81580: First you need to load up the Forge with metal, After that you will have to use your tongs to remove the impure metal and refine the good, clean one to get the Refined metal, After that you will take it to the Input console and load it up.

[17:57:41] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: You start with the charred metal, then you move up to scrap metal. then you melt down the scrap metal and repeat the process. After going through it three times, you get refined metal.
[17:57:43] CCA.C08-GRID.OfC.01993: Get it?
[17:57:50] Adrian Seweryn: // ok
