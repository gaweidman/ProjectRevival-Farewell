[12:59:49] Uriel Akkad: /y One moment
[13:00:40] Uriel Akkad: Come on in
[13:00:57] Uriel Akkad: Just finished up the Electric Generator.
[13:00:58] Jim 'Watcher 3' Bostello: Holy shit
[13:01:08] Jim 'Watcher 3' Bostello: This im impressive, to say the least.
[13:01:20] Jim 'Watcher 3' Bostello: What're you gonna use this for?
[13:01:28] Uriel Akkad: Yeah, still got to install the Car Batteries and Extra Energy Storage Units but, the 6-STEN Battery is hooked up to just about anything.
[13:01:39] Uriel Akkad: Got the LCD Monitor hooked up reporting Stats and Vitals of the Systems.
[13:01:44] Uriel Akkad: Heating and Cooling Valves.
[13:01:53] Uriel Akkad: Not really sure but, it can applied to just about anything.
[13:02:08] Uriel Akkad: Heating Rebar Bolts, Charing Electric Units.
[13:02:16] Uriel Akkad: Automatic Shell Forging.
[13:02:24] Jim 'Watcher 3' Bostello: And, Car Battery charging?
[13:02:30] Uriel Akkad: Anything charging.
[13:02:35] Uriel Akkad: But yeah I got a car battery.
[13:02:40] Jim 'Watcher 3' Bostello: Well then, I'll have to stop by when my car battery dies.
[13:02:44] Uriel Akkad: Sure.
[13:03:00] Uriel Akkad: It's portable too, can hook it all up and pack it down incase I ever got to move.
[13:03:08] Jim 'Watcher 3' Bostello: And if you didn't know, I have a car - If we ever have to go anywhere, we could fit you, Ethan, and someone else in it.
[13:03:34] Uriel Akkad: I heard, yeah. I'll stick to boots on ground for now but if you need a recharge for a small fee this Generator could make quick work of it.
[13:03:44] Jim 'Watcher 3' Bostello: Alright, fair enough.
[13:03:51] Uriel Akkad: Now uh can I get those shells.
[13:03:52] Dropped "Ethan King" from server<STEAM_0:1:17219621>
[13:04:01] Jim 'Watcher 3' Bostello: You know of the new frequency? -
[13:04:08] Uriel Akkad: Come on in to the Living Room. New Freq for what?
[13:04:11] Jim 'Watcher 3' Bostello: /me would take the die cast out of his bag, putting it down
[13:04:20] Jim 'Watcher 3' Bostello: Communication..?
[13:04:25] Uriel Akkad: For Combine?
[13:04:28] Uriel Akkad: Did they change it?
[13:04:42] Jim 'Watcher 3' Bostello: Nah, between the rebels, they changed the Combine frequency though.
[13:04:50] Uriel Akkad: Oh, damn. Well does anyone know that?
[13:05:03] Jim 'Watcher 3' Bostello: Ethan and I, the new frequency is 124.6
[13:05:10] Uriel Akkad: Alrighty.
[13:05:13] Uriel Akkad: Now uh, where's the metal.
[13:05:17] Jim 'Watcher 3' Bostello: Right, right.
[13:05:47] Jim 'Watcher 3' Bostello: Ah, shit, I think I left my metal in my locker, Armor scraps work? Their pretty much the same thing anyways.
[13:06:19] Uriel Akkad: I'm not really sure, we could try to break it down into some metal and that might actually give us a fair amount of refined resources. Just need source hot enough to smelt it.
[13:07:02] Jim 'Watcher 3' Bostello: Well, I got wires, you could hook them up to the battery and try melting the armor with said copper wires? Or..
[13:07:36] Uriel Akkad: Uh, Yeah. Could make the Electric Generator heat up some kind of Kiln.
[13:08:07] Jim 'Watcher 3' Bostello: /me would dig through his bag..
[13:08:37] Jim 'Watcher 3' Bostello: I'm getting fucked in the *ass* here, I left my fuckin' wires in my locker. You ain't got spare wires?
[13:09:01] Uriel Akkad: All my Cables went into making the Generator, I got a roll of a Powercable that's about it.
[13:09:14] Jim 'Watcher 3' Bostello: Well, bigger wire.
[13:09:19] Jim 'Watcher 3' Bostello: Might conduct more heat.
[13:09:27] Uriel Akkad: It's a bit more then "Bigger" and it conducts 220 Volts.
[13:09:42] Jim 'Watcher 3' Bostello: Well then, that should work, no?
[13:09:56] Uriel Akkad: It should, if you have a container *for* the Armor Scraps.
[13:10:01] Uriel Akkad: I'm not just going to melt it on the table.
[13:10:06] Jim 'Watcher 3' Bostello: Well, yeah.

[13:10:29] Uriel Akkad: /me *Lays out the Secondary Power Cable, syncing it up to the Electric Generator and Hooking up the Full Car Battery.*

[13:10:41] Jim 'Watcher 3' Bostello: Okay, okay, dumb question.
[13:10:45] Uriel Akkad: Very.
[13:10:58] Uriel Akkad: How many Armor Scraps you got.
[13:11:06] Jim 'Watcher 3' Bostello: Four
[13:11:22] Jim 'Watcher 3' Bostello: I got blacksmith tongs, I could just hold them up?
[13:11:28] Uriel Akkad: /me *Begins to Cave out a Small Dig-Out about 6 Inches Wide, 10 Inches Long and a Foot Deep.*
[13:11:38] Uriel Akkad: And have them melt onto the floor or hopefully into the die cast?
[13:11:39] Uriel Akkad: Wont work.
[13:11:45] Uriel Akkad: We need a container.
[13:11:53] Uriel Akkad: To melt the metal, have it stored, and then pour it in.
[13:12:11] Uriel Akkad: /me *Finishes matting out the hole, he'd move over to his Crates.*
[13:12:30] Uriel Akkad: You said there was money involved, right?
[13:12:34] Jim 'Watcher 3' Bostello: Yes.
[13:12:43] Uriel Akkad: Great, because this is very pricey.
[13:12:56] Jim 'Watcher 3' Bostello: Just name your price.
[13:14:44] Uriel Akkad: /me *Syncs up a Radiator Helix and Two Double-AA Batteries for a Booster Shot of Electricity, he'd hook up the Helix to the Hole and fed in Glass Shards to Smelt and Make a Container-Mold out of, With the Hole serving as a Pseudo Cast, making sure the-*
