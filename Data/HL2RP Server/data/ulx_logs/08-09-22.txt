[16:14:00] Alex Palovichov: I've yet to see them...eat
[16:14:07] Eric Etringeux: We've seen several cases where they put solid matter into the chest.

[16:14:15] Alex Palovichov: But what for...
[16:14:19] Alex Palovichov: Nutrients?

[16:16:27] Eric Etringeux: But it's strange how it sharpens and broadens in the body of the... big zombie.
[16:16:47] Eric Etringeux: Our assumption is that it wants to eat, but, we're not sure why.
[16:16:55] Eric Etringeux: We're trying to gain voices before wemake any assumptions.
[16:17:02] Eric Etringeux: So, why do the zombies eat?
[16:17:37] Alex Palovichov: Eating isn't the problem...They couldn't keep any nutrients...Perhaps the parasites urges to...feed itself...Perhaps it uses the hosts previous digestive system to better aid in keeping itself fed...
[16:18:03] Alex Palovichov: I doubt any nutrients would be needed in a host such as that...The blood wouldn't be able to carry it around the body...
[16:18:15] Alex Palovichov: The heart doesn't exactly work...
[16:18:25] Alex Palovichov: Can't pump blood and nutrients...
[16:18:40] Alex Palovichov: But...Could be possible to be feeding the parasite itself...
[16:18:40] Eric Etringeux: Right. We know for a fact the host is kept in some partial way, alive.
[16:18:45] Eric Etringeux: But it isn't well sustained.
[16:19:03] Alex Palovichov: Indeed...Most likely kept "alive" through the nervous system that the parasite hijacks
[16:19:17] Eric Etringeux: See, we thought that too.
[16:19:23] Eric Etringeux: And that's our leading theory.
[16:19:26] Eric Etringeux: Statistically speaking, we have around 19 zombies to 1 big zombie.
[16:19:27] Alex Palovichov: Any normal human would be dead...That thing...The thing that could be somewhat alive...Is the brain...
[16:19:32] Alex Palovichov: Hm...
[16:19:53] Client "Chicken" connected.
[16:19:54] Alex Palovichov: The parasite...could perhaps only use what is given...And for the giant...
[16:19:59] Alex Palovichov: There must be certain...factors
[16:20:12] Alex Palovichov: Perhaps a person with a large muscle mass...
[16:20:23] Alex Palovichov: Or other certain factors I don't know of...
[16:20:40] Alex Palovichov: Perhaps even the parasite itself can kickstart muscle growth...
[16:20:55] Alex Palovichov: It has been seen in normal necrotics...
[16:20:58] Alex Palovichov: The hands...
[16:21:10] Alex Palovichov: And in the faster variants...
[16:21:23] Alex Palovichov: The parasite can kickstart adrenaline production...
[16:21:26] Eric Etringeux: Yes, the muscle mass seems to deteriorate significantly.
[16:21:29] Eric Etringeux: Look at the forearm here.
[16:21:35] Alex Palovichov: Indeed...
[16:21:39] Eric Etringeux: See how tight it is to the bone?
[16:21:46] Alex Palovichov: It does...degrade...So does all dead things...
[16:22:01] Alex Palovichov: Perhaps the headcrab can only sustaine such a amount of a host
[16:22:19] Eric Etringeux: Here's something else we've noticed.
[16:22:24] Alex Palovichov: The things needed for killing...show less rot...
[16:23:01] Eric Etringeux: In capitivity, when we hold the zombies, they either fully die, speaking from the body, or stay alive another 2 weeks until starvation occurs.
[16:23:08] Eric Etringeux: In both of these cases, we don't feed them.
[16:23:16] Alex Palovichov: Starvation...
[16:23:18] Alex Palovichov: Odd...
[16:23:22] Eric Etringeux: Very.
[16:23:28] Alex Palovichov: The host shouldn't be taking any form of nutrients...
[16:23:42] Alex Palovichov: The parasites have been shown to be able to live for...quite some time without food
[16:24:07] Client "Stitch" connected.
[16:24:29] Eric Etringeux: The research notes say the ones who live to see starvation are, as noted by the research teams, in visibly better condition.
[16:24:30] Alex Palovichov: They feed solid matter into the..."mouth"
[16:24:34] Eric Etringeux: Much less damaged, if you will.
[16:24:55] Alex Palovichov: What do they do with the food they put in the open cavity...
[16:24:58] Alex Palovichov: Chew it?
[16:25:00] Alex Palovichov: Not a chance
[16:25:07] Eric Etringeux: Yes, actually.
[16:25:09] Alex Palovichov: They just stuff...meat...into it
[16:25:15] Alex Palovichov: How would it get within the stomach
[16:25:23] Alex Palovichov: I have seen the cavity bite down on peoples heads...
[16:25:32] Alex Palovichov: Though not be able to gain any form of nutrients...
[16:25:46] Eric Etringeux: We've noticed the electrical impulses sent through the body can be used to stimulate parts of the body that don't frequently move.
[16:25:51] Alex Palovichov: The stomach...if its still functional...most likely cannot have stomach acid....
[16:26:00] Alex Palovichov: Yes indeed...I have seen them kill people with that "mouth"
[16:26:12] Alex Palovichov: But they cannot gain any nutrients from just stuffing meat into it...
[16:26:21] Alex Palovichov: It wouldn't get anywhere...
[16:26:32] Alex Palovichov: The vital organs rot...
[16:26:43] Alex Palovichov: The stomach wouldn't be able to be reached...
[16:26:55] Eric Etringeux: The assumption is that these movements can be used to.. more or less, manipulate food into the stomach.
[16:27:26] Alex Palovichov: But what then...It would have to go through the digestive system...A very....hard to replicate procedure...
[16:27:42] Alex Palovichov: Any opening too large...would just lead to the stomach acid leaking out...
