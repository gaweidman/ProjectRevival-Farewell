[17:03:30] Anne Wayle: Nice to meet you.
[17:03:43] Anne Wayle: Tip about the cameras, I don't recommend running or jumping around them unless you like beatings.
[17:03:52] Anne Wayle: Most cops ignore them though.
[17:03:58] Nova Wrenrey: nice to meet you
[17:04:11] Anne Wayle: you too.
[17:04:18] Anne Wayle: Let me show you around.
[17:04:54] Anne Wayle: These here are the apartments.
[17:04:59] Anne Wayle: This is where most people live.
[17:05:05] Anne Wayle: Big button opens the doors.
[17:05:12] Anne Wayle: This here is a blood donation machine
[17:05:20] Anne Wayle: If you stick your arm in it, you can get some tokens for your blood.
[17:05:22] Anne Wayle: .//tokens are the currency
[17:05:28] Nova Wrenrey: okay
[17:05:29] Anne Wayle: .//hit e on it to donate blood if you like, it takes 5 HP
[17:05:43] Anne Wayle: Let's see.

[17:06:17] Anne Wayle: Up here are the apartments.
[17:06:48] Nova Wrenrey: okay cool
[17:07:05] Anne Wayle: They've got little things on the door that show who lives where..
[17:07:18] Anne Wayle: You don't have one assigned yet, I assume, if you're brand new.
[17:07:25] Anne Wayle: Let me show you an interior.

[17:08:37] Anne Wayle: .//i programmed that actually
[17:08:39] Nova Wrenrey: nice

[17:11:51] Anne Wayle: This here... I'm not sure what it is.
[17:12:00] Nova Wrenrey: strange
[17:12:01] Anne Wayle: It used to be a normal apartment, but now I just see metrocops going in and out.
[17:12:08] Anne Wayle: Not sure if it's closed for an investigation or what.
[17:12:18] Anne Wayle: That's all for here..
[17:12:19] Nova Wrenrey: interesting
[17:12:57] Nova Wrenrey: well thanks for showing me around the apartments
[17:13:21] Anne Wayle: That's not all if you want to see more.

[17:14:06] Anne Wayle: .//we could assign a metrocop for it though hehehe
[17:14:31] Anne Wayle: These here are the other apartments. It's more of the same stuff.
[17:14:45] Anne Wayle: This here is a store, uh...

[17:15:25] Anne Wayle: Over here's a vendor, he's got things for you. I recommend a flashlight, and of course food if you need it.
[17:15:39] Anne Wayle: You've got a respirator, so you don't need a suit or filter
[17:15:40] Nova Wrenrey: yes a flashlight

[17:18:29] Anne Wayle: Different than since I last came here.
[17:18:49] Anne Wayle: We've got a work desk.
[17:18:58] Anne Wayle: So if you need loyalist points and there's a metrocop here, you can ask him for work.
[17:19:01] Anne Wayle: And you'll get an LP in return.
[17:19:08] Anne Wayle: .//loyalist points determine how loyal you are to the combie
[17:19:09] Nova Wrenrey: okay
[17:19:15] Anne Wayle: .//at -10 you're wanted and are executed

[17:21:11] Anne Wayle: This thing here will buy your resin for uh... Two tokens I think.
[17:21:14] Anne Wayle: Not much else it really does.
[17:21:25] Nova Wrenrey: hmm
[17:21:27] Anne Wayle: Resin are these little pucks of metal, you'll know them if you see them.
[17:22:01] Anne Wayle: This here is the Civil Workers Union headquarters for the precinct.
