[19:05:57] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The work cycle will be in the sewers, so you won't be coming with, you'll just be searching them.
[19:06:13] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Then an OTA, specifically a hazmat unit, will be escorting them into the sewer.
[19:06:25] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: They'll be dismantling old arcade cabinets for parts.

[19:07:42] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: You will just be searching the citizens in front of warehouse 3 when the announcement goes off.
[19:07:45] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Do I make myself clearer?
[19:07:49] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.03672: Yes sir
