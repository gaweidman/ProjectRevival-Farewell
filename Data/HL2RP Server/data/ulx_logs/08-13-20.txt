[14:31:59] Adrienne Evans: Yeah.
[14:32:24] Journey Robertson: He needs to get into the QZ, it could have this fucking wierd ass crystal that lets him do some crazy shit.
[14:32:45] Adrienne Evans: I'm sorry.
[14:32:49] Adrienne Evans: Let me get this straight.
[14:32:51] Adrienne Evans: Your friend.
[14:32:56] Adrienne Evans: Is the thing that was on the screen.
[14:33:44] Journey Robertson: Well.....partner would be a better term but yes i've been working with him. I've been sneaking into the QZ entrance and stole a bunch of shit to prep for this...."expedition" into the QZ
[14:33:56] Adrienne Evans: /me takes a step back.
[14:34:01] Journey Robertson: Not in the QZ.
[14:34:17] Journey Robertson: Just in the entrance area where they clean the suits.
[14:34:41] Journey Robertson: They have a few crates and shit, i've taken plenty of materials from them.
[14:34:45] Journey Robertson: Also.
[14:34:56] Journey Robertson: /me takes out a outdated looking CCA mask.
[14:35:01] Journey Robertson: I found this
[14:35:04] Adrienne Evans: Hm.
[14:35:08] Journey Robertson: /me Takes out a few other things
[14:35:24] Journey Robertson: yeah
[14:35:31] Journey Robertson: Plenty of shit
[14:35:39] Adrienne Evans: Hm.
[14:36:15] Journey Robertson: but...without the assistance of other rebels this is nothing more than a dream.
[14:36:43] Adrienne Evans: Hold on...
[14:36:44] Adrienne Evans: I need to.
[14:36:45] Journey Robertson: So.....i will simply ask for the knowledge needed to defend myself. Whether it be gun blueprints-
[14:36:46] Adrienne Evans: Grab someone.

[14:46:23] James Albright: Let me grab a mike.
[14:46:24] Journey Robertson: This is......rather impressive
[14:46:31] James Albright: No, stay there.
[14:46:42] James Albright: /me comes back holding a microphone.
[14:46:56] James Albright: /it It's the really skinny, posable one. Like the announcer from TF2 uses.
[14:47:02] Journey Robertson: .// Bruh
[14:47:18] James Albright: /me places the microphone on the desk, plugs it into something, and then starts a sound recording.
[14:47:21] James Albright: Alright.
[14:47:39] Journey Robertson: Wonderful......now....shall we continue?
[14:47:43] James Albright: Yeah.
[14:47:49] James Albright: So this thing wants to get into the QZ.
[14:47:55] James Albright: So it can get a crystral.
[14:47:58] James Albright: .//crystal.*
[14:48:26] Journey Robertson: Yes, exactly.....and i've seen what that thing can do.....it just makes things dissapear without much problem.
[14:49:03] James Albright: We saw.
[14:49:06] Journey Robertson: It has a small crystal but it's weaker than a larger one.....if we could get a large one.......i couldn't imagine what it could do.
[14:49:08] James Albright: And it likes you?
[14:49:43] Journey Robertson: Seems so, i've been assisting it with getting to the QZ. We had one other guy who was with us but......he's a traitor.
[14:49:56] James Albright: Hm.
[14:50:05] James Albright: And why are you involving with him?
[14:50:09] James Albright: Fear?
[14:51:01] Journey Robertson: I believe helping a Alien with that much power that hates the Combine as well......it could be priceless what that thing could do once we get the crystal.
[14:51:27] James Albright: So you think it'll help us fight for independence as well?
[14:51:27] Journey Robertson: And it's on our side, i've never once been attacked or felt fear while near it.
[14:51:37] John Zimmer: // ew
[14:51:41] Journey Robertson: easily, it simply wants to defeat the Combine.
[14:51:42] James Albright: //?
[14:52:12] Journey Robertson: It's world was taken over by the Combine, it calls the Combine something like "The claw"
[14:52:51] Journey Robertson: Wouldn't you think that it would be in your best interest to help it?
[14:53:16] James Albright: I mean.
[14:53:22] James Albright: It seems pretty against the combine.

[14:54:11] Journey Robertson: wonderful observation, that is why i believe it could truly bring down the Combine with a massive amount of planning. Or atleast damage the Combine to all hell.
[14:54:31] James Albright: Here's my question.
[14:54:34] Journey Robertson: but.....i can't help it alone......i'm not experi-
[14:54:46] James Albright: Why does a big alien who is apparently from somewhere far, far away... have something against the combine?
[14:54:48] James Albright: Or any knowledge?
[14:55:12] Journey Robertson: It's world was also destroyed by the Combine i think.
[14:55:24] Journey Robertson: Isn't it the same with the vorties?
[14:55:34] James Albright: Wat?
[14:55:37] James Albright: .//What?*
[14:55:46] James Albright: .//wait hold on
[14:55:58] James Albright: .//void that exchange, i forgot it's pretty known that hte universal union is interdimensional

[14:56:02] Journey Robertson: .// Bruh
[14:56:15] James Albright: Hm.
[14:56:19] James Albright: Alright.
[14:56:57] James Albright: So the plan is help the alien, get it more power, and it, single-handedly, along with us, will destroy the Combine.
[14:58:14] Journey Robertson: Hm......well it's more complicated than that....but to abridge it yes. Give it more power and assist it with damaging the Combine. It can fucking teleport so saying it couldn't do a lot of damage in a short time frame is just ignorant.
[14:58:36] James Albright: It would be a nice ally.
[14:59:04] James Albright: Clearly it's strong.
[14:59:05] James Albright: Alright.
[14:59:09] James Albright: What can we do?
[14:59:49] Client "Johnnie butters" connected.
[14:59:54] John Zimmer: // yes
[15:00:06] Journey Robertson: Hm....escorting us to the QZ and searching for that crystal is the best thing at the moment. If we find the crystal then that alien will get more power.
[15:00:39] Journey Robertson: It's only me and him, but your assistance is very important at the moment. After finding the crystal the alien will probably know what to do.
[15:01:29] Journey Robertson: And then.......well let the alien do it's thing.....while also giving it shelter. 
[15:01:39] James Albright: Alright.
[15:02:00] James Albright: So you need escort to the QZ and help finding the crystal?
[15:02:03] Journey Robertson: // TFW gamer times are happening
[15:02:06] Journey Robertson: Exactly.

[15:03:27] Journey Robertson: Two stories.
[15:03:27] James Albright: Alright.
[15:03:31] Journey Robertson: Hard to miss
[15:03:41] John Zimmer: // yup
[15:03:42] James Albright: What if we were to offer you somewhere else to live?
[15:04:01] Journey Robertson: That.....would be wonderful, whats the catch though?
[15:04:13] Journey Robertson: // Player Johnnie butters has joined the game nice name
[15:04:17] John Zimmer: // mhm
[15:04:20] James Albright: Don't piss off the Combine, don't do anything stupid.
[15:04:38] Journey Robertson: So do what i'm already doing.
[15:04:39] James Albright: We work together. There's no separation bullshit.
[15:04:39] Journey Robertson: Got it
[15:04:42] James Albright: Great.
[15:04:54] James Albright: We'll make some room for you.
[15:05:04] Journey Robertson: Thank you, how long will the wait be?
[15:05:16] James Albright: Not sure. An hour or so?
[15:05:30] Journey Robertson: Alright, would you like me to go fill in "Larry"?
[15:05:34] James Albright: Yep.
[15:05:39] Journey Robertson: Thank you
[15:05:43] James Albright: I'll let you out.

[15:07:20] Journey Robertson: I have amazing news
[15:07:50] Journey Robertson: A rebel group called Lambda is going to escort us through the QZ and help us with finding the Crystal.
[15:08:00] Journey Robertson: And we're going to get better shelter
[15:08:23] Journey Robertson: So a better home, this place we're in gets raided all the time from what i know.
[15:08:36] Journey Robertson: So we'll be much safer
[15:08:48] Journey Robertson: Uh.....Larry?
[15:08:51] Carl Everson: Good.
[15:08:53] Carl Everson: Good, good, good.
[15:09:07] Journey Robertson: I know, in about a hour they'll have a room set up for us.
[15:09:35] Journey Robertson: So....thank fucking god. These guys are the real deal to. They have armor and everything
[15:09:44] Carl Everson: Good! This happy me.
[15:10:14] Journey Robertson: yeah me to Larry, if this goes well it'll mark a good day for us.
[15:10:30] Journey Robertson: By the way, what will you do after you get the better crystal?
[15:10:48] Carl Everson: Talk other zee nobe.
[15:10:52] Carl Everson: civil zee nobe.
[15:10:54] Carl Everson: Not feral.
[15:10:57] Carl Everson: They help us.
[15:11:08] Journey Robertson: /me Seems ready to fucking yell but keeps it in.
[15:11:39] Journey Robertson: Fucking great, we'll have help and everything. This is so fucking good. Are you able to since if a large crystal is near?
[15:11:54] Journey Robertson: .// Sense*
[15:12:02] Carl Everson: I know one near. In city.
[15:12:14] Journey Robertson: Alright, then it's got to be in the QZ.
[15:12:33] Journey Robertson: No other place would have it considering the way the QZ is
[15:13:32] Journey Robertson: Holy shit, i'm happy to have met you Larry. We might even be able to atleast fucking make the Combine bleed with this kinda of help.
[15:13:51] Carl Everson: Blled?
[15:13:54] Carl Everson: .//Bleed?*
[15:13:57] Carl Everson: They bleed all.
[15:14:22] Journey Robertson: Yeah....i just mean we might be able to really hurt the Combine.

[15:14:46] Carl Everson cleared decals
[15:14:57] Journey Robertson: Alright, i'm gonna go to sleep for a moment. I've gotta calm down.
[15:14:59] Carl Everson: Hurt to death.
[15:15:04] Carl Everson: Good. Talk later. Good work.
[15:15:05] Journey Robertson: Yep
