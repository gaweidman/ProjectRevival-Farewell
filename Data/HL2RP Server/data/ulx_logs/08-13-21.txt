[23:32:12] Raymon Kalachya: Ah quite generous. Thank you sir. And thank you for helping keep us alive in the snow
[23:32:24] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: Not much they can do to me, I'm pretty much the only active QrM in the city.
[23:32:25] Raymon Kalachya: /me takes both rations, tucking them under his right arm
[23:32:27] Anastasia Ivanovich: I've never been in a City.
[23:32:34] Raymon Kalachya: Hah, well that is a lot of power
[23:32:41] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: Yep, now enjoy your food.

[23:33:01] Raymon Kalachya: So, Anastasia. What do you think of the City
[23:33:05] Anastasia Ivanovich: I don't know
[23:33:13] Anastasia Ivanovich: I've never lived in one. At least, memory wise.
[23:33:41] Anastasia Ivanovich: all I know is I need a job most likely
[23:33:52] Raymon Kalachya: Mhm. You need some Loyalty Points for that
[23:33:59] Anastasia Ivanovich: If I'm feeling too comfortable. Might- Loyalty Points?
[23:34:05] Raymon Kalachya: /me sets one of the rations down and tears it open
[23:34:21] Raymon Kalachya: Yeah, it's a system the Union uses to keep people 'in-line'
[23:34:21] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: // There, I accepted your friend request.
[23:34:23] Anastasia Ivanovich: // what are the PAC rules btw?

[23:34:49] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: // You can do just about anything as long as it makes sense IC.
[23:35:00] Raymon Kalachya: Basically, the more loyalty points you get, the more trust you get from the Union and Officers. Plus better rations. OH and at five loyalty points you can join the Worker's Union
[23:35:02] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: // Or if you have permission by a staff member.
[23:35:07] Anastasia Ivanovich: // ah
[23:35:18] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: // So, if you have a shovel IC you can put it on your back or some shit using Pac and it would be totally allowed.
[23:35:23] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: // Or you can have a suitcase.

[23:36:58] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: // You missed us killing a space worm and being teleported back to the city.

[23:38:16] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: // Sector QrM isn't a command rank, they just give supplies to all the QrMs.

[23:38:50] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: // Okay, but what QrM would I be ordering around?
[23:38:51] Raymon Kalachya: // Thinkin' abou applying for CP

[23:40:19] Anastasia Ivanovich: then what *would* classify as contraband?
[23:40:22] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: I can't really call it a weapon, and it isn't a power tool.
[23:40:34] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: Various things, but simple tools like screwdrivers and shovels are not one of them.
