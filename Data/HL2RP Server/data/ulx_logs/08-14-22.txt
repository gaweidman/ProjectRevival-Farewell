[18:29:25] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: If you get a respirator you breathe and wear your shirt at the same time
[18:29:44] Jonathan Jackson: I'll remember that
[18:29:52] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.08313: alright, take care
[18:29:54] Jonathan Jackson: Thank you again.
[18:34:59] Jonathan Jackson to admins: I need to unload the sofa.

[18:39:56] Jonathan Jackson: Might want to breathe, just a tip

[18:39:57] Ryan Maley<STEAM_0:1:53097688> used the tool colour on models/props_combine/combine_emitter01.mdl
[18:40:17] Ryan Maley: I'm doing good. I like the new sofa, looks good
[18:40:29] Jonathan Jackson: Yeah, I got it for free believe it or not
[18:40:39] Jonathan Jackson: Some CWU guy gave it to me after I did some working.
[18:40:49] Jonathan Jackson: Work, rather.
[18:40:51] Ryan Maley: No kidding? Good deal.
[18:41:04] Ryan Maley: i like it
[18:41:07] Jonathan Jackson: I'll take it no problem
[18:41:10] Jonathan Jackson: Same here
[18:41:16] Jonathan Jackson: It beats having nothing in the room
[18:41:23] Ryan Maley: Yeah, this place definitely looks empty.
[18:41:44] Ryan Maley: I've been debating trying to snag some stuff from the side of the road or something.
[18:42:04] Jonathan Jackson: Make sure you aren't just taking trash off the road before you take it.
[18:42:36] Ryan Maley: definitely not. I don't want to bring in a chair that'll shatter when I sit in it.
[18:42:41] Jonathan Jackson: True
[18:42:44] Jonathan Jackson: I also got this horse statue over here on the kitchen counter.
[18:42:51] Jonathan Jackson: It's the little things in life
[18:42:57] Ryan Maley: oh, nice
[18:43:01] Ryan Maley: Where'd you find that?
[18:43:09] Jonathan Jackson: Bought it off of the guy
[18:43:21] Jonathan Jackson: Didn't cost much, only fifteen tokens
[18:43:53] Ryan Maley: Not bad. Looks fancy
[18:44:04] Ryan Maley: I guess that's a decent side effect of.. all this
[18:44:17] Ryan Maley: Fancy things are now worth as much as stuff that isn't fancy
[18:44:33] Jonathan Jackson: I guess the essentials are now more important
[18:44:49] Ryan Maley: yeah, so maybe a double edged sword.
[18:45:13] Jonathan Jackson: Something like that... Hey ever been to that Cafe Balkan?
[18:45:17] Jonathan Jackson: Something like that
[18:45:21] Jonathan Jackson: Down near the Nexus.
[18:45:32] Ryan Maley: I've seen the inside, never eaten there.
[18:45:50] Ryan Maley: looks comfortable
[18:46:10] Jonathan Jackson: I see, I was thinking of checking the place out, any places you would reccomend? I'm tired of eating stale UU Cereal and rations.
[18:46:56] Ryan Maley: It's not open right now, but that Grizzly Grotto looks like it has potential.
[18:47:09] Ryan Maley: It just exudes comfort
[18:47:20] Jonathan Jackson: Where is that?
[18:47:36] Ryan Maley: down by the slums, want me to show you?
[18:47:43] Jonathan Jackson: Eh sure why not.
[18:48:52] Ryan Maley: nice little speakeasy
[18:48:55] Jonathan Jackson: Nice music. Very old timey.
[18:49:20] Ryan Maley: yeah, it feels like if your grandma owned a bar.
[18:49:23] Ryan Maley: in a good way
[18:49:31] Jonathan Jackson: I suppose
[18:49:37] Jonathan Jackson: Is that just free to enter?
[18:49:42] Ryan Maley: Yeah, it's not claimed
[18:49:50] Ryan Maley: if it's unlocked, chances are good that it's legal
[18:50:09] Jonathan Jackson: Good, just don't want to get trouble after I just got on good terms with the CPs.
[18:50:23] Ryan Maley: No, we should be good.
[18:50:34] Jonathan Jackson: What's with the button?
[18:50:38] Jonathan Jackson: Ah
[18:50:39] Ryan Maley: Oh.
[18:50:39] Jonathan Jackson: Music
[18:50:43] Ryan Maley: makes sense
[18:51:06] Jonathan Jackson: Nice place for sure
[18:51:25] Jonathan Jackson: I don't see why anyone in the CWU wouldn't want to claim it
[18:51:40] Ryan Maley: not sure. Maybe because it's so big, it needs multiple people?
[18:51:58] Jonathan Jackson: Perhaps, I couldn't be certain about it
[18:52:08] Jonathan Jackson: It seems like a great place for sure.
[18:52:17] Ryan Maley: I wouldn't mind running it. Seems like a good thing to do with my time.
[18:52:55] Jonathan Jackson: I've been trying to edge closer to being able to apply for CWU myself, it beats living off rations and the work desk.
[18:53:03] Ryan Maley: Yeah, agreed.
[18:53:13] Jonathan Jackson: And I'm personally not one to get involved in policing.
[18:53:22] Ryan Maley: yeah, me neither. Hard pass
[18:53:23] Jonathan Jackson: Especially not with their em, morals
[18:53:47] Ryan Maley: That's a polite way to put it. I didn't want to say it yet, but yeah,
[18:53:52] Ryan Maley: I'm way good
[18:53:58] Ryan Maley: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
[18:54:26] Jonathan Jackson: I'm not a mind reader but I'm listening
[18:54:36] Ryan Maley: We go in on this place together.
[18:54:58] Ryan Maley: We're two people, we need something to do with our time and we need a better way to live
[18:55:17] Ryan Maley: Enter the CWU, request this place, and make it our own
[18:55:38] Jonathan Jackson: That could work out pretty good. I'm in.
[18:56:04] Ryan Maley: awesome. We need 5 LP for the commerce corps, right?
[18:56:24] Jonathan Jackson: I believe so, I've got what, two LP right now?
[18:56:35] Jonathan Jackson: I'm three off right now I think
[18:56:58] Ryan Maley: I'm not sure how much I have.
[18:57:20] Ryan Maley: So we just try to turn in contraband and do some tasks, kiss a bit of ass?
[18:57:39] Jonathan Jackson: That could work, though I don't come across contraband often
[18:57:46] Jonathan Jackson: Though they did take my shirt earlier
[18:57:51] Jonathan Jackson: I found a CWU one
[18:57:56] Ryan Maley: Oh, yeah, that'll do it.
[18:58:08] Ryan Maley: They *just* confiscated it?
[18:58:29] Jonathan Jackson: Yeah, that's what they said, they gave me a new one for the trouble
[18:58:35] Jonathan Jackson: A green shirt to be exact
[18:58:41] Ryan Maley: That's pretty nice of them, all things considered
[18:58:56] Jonathan Jackson: I was suprised, but I won't complain
[18:58:56] Ryan Maley: Anyways, it's not the cleanest work, but I see people digging around in the dumpsters a lot
[18:59:12] Ryan Maley: Maybe somebody tossed some contraband.
[18:59:17] Jonathan Jackson: That could work, what about that contruction zone?
[18:59:35] Ryan Maley: That too, they might have something.
[18:59:39] Ryan Maley: Oh, shit, I just remembered
[18:59:46] Ryan Maley: /me would pull a zip tie out of his pocket.
[18:59:53] Ryan Maley: I forgot I found this
[19:00:07] Ryan Maley: that should be a couple LP
[19:00:12] Jonathan Jackson: That definitely could be contraband.
[19:00:16] Ryan Maley: .//brb
[19:00:20] Jonathan Jackson: /looc sure
[19:02:25] Ryan Maley: .//back
[19:02:38] Ryan Maley: can't remember where i found it, thoguh
[19:02:53] Ryan Maley: alright, let's get searching, eh?
[19:04:02] Jonathan Jackson: Sure
[19:05:03] Jonathan Jackson: I'll hop over another way, as not to leave this open
[19:05:14] Jonathan Jackson: It's a big evidence sticker open
[19:05:31] Ryan Maley: true. Where do we go through, then?
[19:05:53] Jonathan Jackson: You can reach here from the catwalks, that's how I usually get in
[19:06:12] Ryan Maley: oh, great
[19:07:31] Jonathan Jackson: Uhh this door will do I guess
[19:07:47] Ryan Maley: huh
[19:07:55] Jonathan Jackson: Someone left some scrap
[19:08:07] Ryan Maley: hhholy hell
[19:08:09] Jonathan Jackson: Try not to look down.
[19:08:17] Ryan Maley: /me would gulp
[19:08:27] Ryan Maley: /me would repeat something to himself quickly and somewhat quietly.
[19:08:54] Ryan Maley: I survived worse in the war, i survived worse in the war, I survived worse in the war...
[19:09:10] Ryan Maley: .//WHORE
[19:09:11] Jonathan Jackson: uhh
[19:09:14] Jonathan Jackson: you good?

[19:10:51] Jonathan Jackson: Someone was defninitely down here
[19:10:58] Ryan Maley: true that
[19:11:34] Jonathan Jackson: Personally I would be less obvious
[19:11:38] Ryan Maley: yeah
[19:12:15] Jonathan Jackson: Nothin so far
[19:12:19] Ryan Maley: same here
[19:12:49] Ryan Maley: keyboard

[19:13:25] Jonathan Jackson: Oof
[19:13:30] Jonathan Jackson: i wouldn't want to be that guy

[19:28:00] Jonathan Jackson: Just uhh, lets go on seperate days or something like that
[19:28:11] Ryan Maley: we could say that we found it stashed somewhere.
[19:28:18] Ryan Maley: like we saw a vent in the apartments that looked funny
[19:28:27] Ryan Maley: so we look inside and found that
[19:28:41] Ryan Maley: obviously not our building, we don't want ot get searched
[19:28:41] Jonathan Jackson: That could work
[19:29:07] Ryan Maley: hm

[19:30:22] Jonathan Jackson: I don't feel like em, leaving stuff behind

[19:30:58] Jonathan Jackson: Scuse me though
[19:31:58] Ryan Maley: here
[19:32:08] Ryan Maley: /me would put a written note down on top of one of the crates

[19:32:30] Ryan Maley: me. Us
[19:32:33] Ryan Maley: Something like that
[19:32:46] Jonathan Jackson: I don't know how I feel about being a letter

[22:35:15] Leona Geller: This is the second best smell in the kitchen.

[22:36:10] Alex Palovichov: /ooc brb
[22:36:16] Leona Geller: Porkchops served in a creamy shallot sauce.
[22:36:25] Wilfred Goodfield: Sounds good to me, I'll get that.
[22:36:30] Leona Geller: Wonderful choice.
[22:36:32] Jonathan Jackson: /me takes the plate over to himself, and begins dining on it
[22:36:41] Wilfred Goodfield: Also, little question. Is this...Finger food?
[22:36:45] Wilfred Goodfield: I don't have any utensils.
[22:36:55] Leona Geller: It is, but if you would like a fork and/or a knife I can get them for you.
[22:36:58] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.23710 to admins: look in staff chat
[22:37:04] Wilfred Goodfield: I'll eat like a barbarian, thank you.
[22:37:05] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.23710: // ratio is great
[22:37:34] Wilfred Goodfield: /me drags his plate over to his side and immediately tosses a piece into his mouth.
[22:37:45] Leona Geller: //i promsie dfood to this guy
[22:37:47] Jonathan Jackson: About your question *munch* Ich not an appartment, it is a resturant like this.
[22:38:23] Wilfred Goodfield: oh, why're you eating here then? Wouldn't it be supporting the competition.
[22:38:34] Jonathan Jackson: Its not occupied right now
[22:38:42] Jonathan Jackson: That's why I want to get in CWU to claim it
[22:38:46] Jonathan Jackson: /me keeps eating.
[22:39:08] Ethan King: /pm Leona Holy fukc I still have Dustins CID 
[22:39:24] Leona Geller: /pm king holy shit
[22:39:27] Wilfred Goodfield: /me quickly eats a-few more before he speaks again.

[22:39:46] Jonathan Jackson: // welcome back
[22:39:47] Wilfred Goodfield: So, do you know where I can get some work here?
[22:39:58] Ethan King: // you are not welcome back 
[22:40:03] Jonathan Jackson: Uhh you can apply for CWU at 5 Loyalty Points
[22:40:04] Wilfred Goodfield: // FUCK you
[22:40:06] Alex Palovichov: /ooc alright then cya
[22:40:10] Jonathan Jackson: Or you can get work from the work desk
[22:40:11] Dropped "Alex Palovichov" from server<STEAM_0:1:591779303>
[22:40:17] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.23710: // oh
[22:40:19] Client "Bean" connected.
[22:40:21] Wilfred Goodfield: oh, yeah. Where's the work desk?
[22:40:22] Jonathan Jackson: // lmao
[22:40:40] Wilfred Goodfield: Loyality Points, by the way. Are those just gained from proving your worth to the combine?
[22:40:49] Wilfred Goodfield: How much does a fair fellow like yourself earn?
[22:40:57] Jonathan Jackson: Just down by the Nexus, and yeah basically. Like turning in contraband.
[22:41:03] Jonathan Jackson: Earn what, tokens?
[22:41:03] Client "Bean" spawned in server <STEAM_0:1:591779303> (took 44 seconds).
[22:41:08] Jonathan Jackson: I don't have a job currently
[22:41:09] Wilfred Goodfield: No, Loyality Points.
[22:41:14] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.23710: // same vibe of that time i banned myserlf
[22:41:16] Jonathan Jackson: Oh I have two currently from working

[22:41:40] Leona Geller: //you can
[22:41:42] Jonathan Jackson: // Do it
[22:41:47] Wilfred Goodfield: Oh, that's cool I thought I'd have to risk my life like the white-masked dude back at the apartments.
[22:41:48] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.23710: // I CANT
[22:41:59] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.23710: // Command "ulx ban", argument #1: No target found or target has immunity!
[22:42:03] Jonathan Jackson: I think that guy is an idiot frankly
[22:42:23] Jonathan Jackson: He tried to make us stay put in an active shooting zone
[22:42:43] Wilfred Goodfield: The Supression Field has been up for twenty years now, I'm sure that the guy was practically raised under combine rule so It's no suprise to me that he's blindly following orders just like every civil protection you see.
[22:42:51] Wilfred Goodfield: That guy is a future OTA, I'm telling you.
[22:43:16] Jonathan Jackson: I still don't know what an OTA is besides what I just saw of them, are they just like elite Metrocops?
[22:43:25] Jonathan Jackson: They looked like they meant buisness
[22:43:25] Wilfred Goodfield: He Isn't just a civil protection...He's more loyal then that, much more blind, to me.
[22:43:38] Leona Geller to admins: where's tjat npte[ad
[22:43:48] Wilfred Goodfield: They're like Civil Protection, but I heard they went under memory replacement...So...
[22:44:01] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.23710 to admins: ict hq
[22:44:02] Wilfred Goodfield: Probably not much different then how that other guy acted.

[22:44:09] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.23710 to admins: by the wall
[22:44:14] Jonathan Jackson: Pshh memory replacement? What is the George Orwells 1984?
[22:44:17] Wilfred Goodfield: /me finishes eating his meal
[22:44:22] Jonathan Jackson: Jeez imagine that
[22:44:23] Wilfred Goodfield: What the fuck is George Orwell?
[22:44:28] Jonathan Jackson: /me wraps up his meal as well
[22:44:31] Jonathan Jackson: An author
[22:44:47] Jonathan Jackson: Wrote a bunch of dystopias.
[22:45:04] Wilfred Goodfield: Oh, right! Mr. Orwell, I remember the author now. 
[22:45:18] Wilfred Goodfield: /looc George Orwell published 1984 in the 1940's
[22:45:26] Jonathan Jackson: /looc I am aware yes
[22:45:27] Wilfred Goodfield: /looc that means It's very possible that Breen read 1984
[22:45:36] Jonathan Jackson: /looc possibly
[22:45:44] Leona Geller: /paneladd "http://publicfiles.projectrevival.site.nfoservers.com/eye.png" 2 50

[22:45:50] Leona Geller to admins: can you see it
[22:45:51] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.23710 to admins: yoo
[22:45:52] Jonathan Jackson: Either way, I bet you could imagine those books are hard to come by now
[22:45:55] Wilfred Goodfield: uh, she's gone.
[22:46:02] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.23710 to admins: is it possible to do that for other images
[22:46:03] Wilfred Goodfield: Sorry If i'm being impolite, just lemme...
[22:46:08] Jonathan Jackson: There's a kitchen in the back I think
[22:46:08] Leona Geller to admins: yeah
[22:46:09] Leona Geller to admins: easily
[22:46:12] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.23710 to admins: because actual graffiti would be cool
[22:46:16] Wilfred Goodfield: I'm just going to hope so.
[22:46:19] Leona Geller: /toggleraise
[22:46:20] Leona Geller: /toggleraise
[22:46:23] Jonathan Jackson: Or maybe you are blind
[22:46:25] Wilfred Goodfield: Nevermind, she was there the whole time.
[22:46:27] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.23710 to admins: is it physically possible for me to or is it a funky process
[22:46:27] Wilfred Goodfield: Apparently.
[22:46:29] Leona Geller: /me takes out a large sautee pan
[22:46:31] Wilfred Goodfield: /me laughs.
[22:46:39] Leona Geller to admins: if you have a driect link you can use /paneladd
[22:46:40] Jonathan Jackson: /me chuckles a bit
[22:46:42] Wilfred Goodfield: No, there's no books.
[22:46:46] Leona Geller to admins: but if you odn't have a direct link i need to upload it to the PR webserver
[22:46:49] Wilfred Goodfield: Not anything other then manuals, atleast.
[22:46:56] Wilfred Goodfield: Pretty sure the combine burned 'em, all.
[22:47:03] Jonathan Jackson: I've seen peoples appartments, they sure do have books
[22:47:07] Jonathan Jackson: I think it's a loyalty thing
[22:47:21] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.23710 to admins: so it only uses links from that?
[22:47:25] Wilfred Goodfield: They're blank and don't have any labels. What could possibly even be on them?
[22:47:27] Leona Geller to admins: it uses links from anything
[22:47:37] Jonathan Jackson: I'd imagine they are old
[22:47:46] Leona Geller: /me would take out a large pan and put it on her burners. She puts a bit of oil on the pan, spreads it, and puts 6 porkchops on the pan.
[22:47:46] Jonathan Jackson: Maybe russian literature
[22:48:02] Leona Geller to admins: it shows a preview
[22:48:21] Jonathan Jackson: Person came in and backed out immediately
[22:48:22] Wilfred Goodfield: I'm HOPING you get paid enough for a hard day's work, since I'm blowing tokens on this joint.
[22:48:25] Leona Geller: /it She cranks the heat up high and gets a good sear going on the porkchops.
[22:48:32] Jonathan Jackson: You get paid pretty good
[22:48:35] Jonathan Jackson: At least I was
[22:48:39] Wilfred Goodfield: They must be allergic to delicious food.
[22:48:43] Jonathan Jackson: I got a free couch out of it too
[22:48:49] Wilfred Goodfield: A whole damn couch?
[22:48:53] Leona Geller: /it Eventually she flips them, and lets them cook a bit more. She pulls out a meat thermometer and temps them.
[22:48:55] Leona Geller: /roll 10
[22:48:58] Leona Geller: /roll 10
[22:49:03] Leona Geller: /it 95.9
[22:49:05] Leona Geller: Alright.
[22:49:13] Jonathan Jackson: Yeah, it was a delivery of furniture to the CWU and they had an extra box they ordered
[22:49:21] Jonathan Jackson: So they gave me it and a 5 token tip
[22:49:27] Leona Geller: /me pulls half-sheet tray and puts it in the bottom of her salamander. 
[22:49:40] Wilfred Goodfield: Fantastic.
[22:49:59] Leona Geller: /it She places the porkchops on it and then pours cream into the pan without measuring it. SHe can still tell the amount.
[22:50:21] Jonathan Jackson: I can tell you this though
[22:50:32] Jonathan Jackson: Having to go through this filter bullshit is a scam
[22:50:50] Leona Geller: /it She adds in dill and thyme, around 2 and a half tablespoons of dill and 1 and a half teaspoons of thyme
[22:50:56] Jonathan Jackson: They drain all our Oxygen and pollute the air to make us pay for filters
[22:51:02] Leona Geller: .//WAIT FUCK
[22:51:02] Jonathan Jackson: I had to pay 50 tokens for this
[22:51:06] Leona Geller: .//I REMEMBERED THE RECIPE WRONG
[22:51:18] Wilfred Goodfield: For a single filter?
[22:51:24] Jonathan Jackson: No a respirator
[22:51:24] Leona Geller: /me would put the shallots in the pan to start. Around 2 and a half cups.
[22:51:28] Jonathan Jackson: I don't need filters anymore
[22:51:37] Jonathan Jackson: But that was awfully expensive
[22:51:45] Jonathan Jackson: It's an investment I guess
[22:51:55] Wilfred Goodfield: Oh. Well, It's a better deal then endlessly blowing cash on filters Isn't it?
[22:52:01] Jonathan Jackson: Maybe
[22:52:04] Leona Geller: /it She lets them get a bit brown, moving her pan back and forth.
[22:52:12] Jonathan Jackson: I'd rather get one of these oxygen dispensers
[22:52:20] Jonathan Jackson: /me looks towards the one on the wall
[22:52:22] Leona Geller: /it AFter they're sufficiently brown, she holds a box of white wine over the pan and lets some into the pan.
[22:52:28] Jonathan Jackson: But I don't think they sell those
[22:52:41] Wilfred Goodfield: What do you think the combine even need with money? I think It's just a method to them.
[22:52:45] Wilfred Goodfield: Some means to a goal.
[22:52:46] Leona Geller: /it A wonderful smell leaves the kitchen along with a bit of steam.
[22:53:00] Leona Geller: /y The smell of that white wine reducing is the best smell in the kitchen.
[22:53:13] Jonathan Jackson: Tokens are just a currency and that currency goes nowhere

[22:53:55] Jonathan Jackson: At least with Pre-War governments it created a tax system where governments would actually provide things...
[22:53:57] Leona Geller: /me would then add in the cream, then dill and thyme. She lets it simmer and turn darker, reducing it a bit
[22:53:58] CCA.C17-GRID.i1.23710: /paneladd "http://publicfiles.projectrevival.site.nfoservers.com/eye.png" 2 50

[22:54:35] Wilfred Goodfield: What's the point? Nothing will change. The only thing we have are indeviduals in a dying body.
[22:54:42] Leona Geller: /me would then add the porkchops back in. She lets the sauce reduce more and the porkchops cook more
[22:55:01] Wilfred Goodfield: Whatever the combine is looking for, they'll take it and leave.
[22:55:39] Jonathan Jackson: Pretty much.
[22:55:49] Wilfred Goodfield: // What are some things you hate about HL2RP?
[22:55:52] Leona Geller: /me would finally temp the porkchops one more final time.
[22:55:54] Jonathan Jackson: That's the point isn't it?
[22:55:57] Leona Geller: //it's hard to make citizenRP good

[22:56:57] Jonathan Jackson: // I hate loyalists
[22:57:06] Alex Palovichov: /ooc I love loyalists....
[22:57:19] Ethan King: // It's fine when it's a joke, but when you find people who argue about how Combine committing genocide is fine that's when an issue starts 
[22:57:24] Leona Geller: //oh also a lot of the communiy

[22:58:09] Alex Palovichov: /ooc I think Im like the only person that likes Eric

[22:58:18] Jonathan Jackson: // I ate chips
[22:58:27] Leona Geller: /me would then pour over the sauce, getting all of it off with a rubber spatula.
