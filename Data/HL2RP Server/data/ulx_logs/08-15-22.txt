[17:42:36] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Then why not open a business?
[17:42:55] Tanya L. Fredrickson: You get to be your own boss, and you can gain more power over time
[17:42:57] Anastasia Semenov: No citizen can legally protect another that's the job of Civil Protection
[17:43:57] Tanya L. Fredrickson: but you can? Protecting them from starvation by selling foods and goods to keep them alive at every turn whilst also being able to keep there hops up by showing a proud happy face amongst all the strife that the crazed assholes cause elsewhere.
[17:44:32] Anastasia Semenov: /me shrugs. "It's not worth the energy."
[17:44:59] Tanya L. Fredrickson: But beating people up for knocking over a can is? You make no sense Anastasia.
[17:45:30] Anastasia Semenov: I stopped trying awhile ago.
[17:45:35] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Clearly.
[17:45:59] Anastasia Semenov: These things you say.. you wish for me to be different, but who are you to tell me the way to live?
[17:47:32] Tanya L. Fredrickson: I mean I have served this glorious union for over three years as a medical professional fixing over two hundred patients in that time span, all of whom equally serve the union in ways unbenounced to me but what would I know, I am just some stranger trying to give you life advice and help push you in the right direction so you can actually enjoy your life a little bit.
[17:48:04] Anastasia Semenov: Now you sound like the bootlicker, haha.
[17:48:16] Anastasia Semenov: /me smiles under her mask after she chuckles at her.
[17:48:17] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Maybe I do.
[17:48:29] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Seriously though, think about it please.
[17:48:45] Tanya L. Fredrickson: I don't want you to hate yourself and your life, bad for my conscious aye?
[17:48:56] Anastasia Semenov: Does it matter?
[17:49:07] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Yeah.
[17:49:13] Anastasia Semenov: Technically you should not have even met me as of right now.
[17:49:23] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Mmm?
[17:49:31] Anastasia Semenov: I SHOULD be dead.
[17:49:37] Anastasia Semenov: But I'm not.
[17:49:40] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Then you have a second chance.
[17:49:45] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Why waste it?
[17:49:52] Tanya L. Fredrickson: // I need oxygen
[17:49:55] Tanya L. Fredrickson: // PLEASE
[17:50:33] Anastasia Semenov: Because when the Combine eventually deem our entire species unfit and unecessary at least as a Delegate of hopefully high rank, I'll get a third chance. If you know what I mean.
[17:52:15] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Fair but, I knew a few construction workers who've outclassed city administrators in usefulness in some cases due to how brilliant their building plans were.
[17:52:42] Tanya L. Fredrickson: One person designed those large towers that the combine used and was a top level importance in a medical case once.
[17:53:08] Tanya L. Fredrickson: being a footsoldier wont do that for you...
[17:53:34] Anastasia Semenov: Yeah that's true. But my chances with the way I'm going are better than being an individual and hoping I do something splendid enough to stay alive.
[17:53:53] Tanya L. Fredrickson: So your gambling basically?
[17:54:19] Anastasia Semenov: That's all we have left.
[17:54:27] Tanya L. Fredrickson: I don't see it as that honestly.
[17:54:38] Anastasia Semenov: We all see it differently nowadays.
[17:55:51] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Both of us are right you know, we live on a beutiful planet together whilst we do that.
[17:56:54] Anastasia Semenov: This planet used to be beautiful.
[17:57:05] Tanya L. Fredrickson: It still is, in a certain point of view.
[17:57:08] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Hell everything is.
[17:57:38] Tanya L. Fredrickson: This city, the combine, humanity, love, hate, war, strife.
[17:57:59] Tanya L. Fredrickson: All of it can be a good thing, or a bad thing given context.
[17:58:23] Anastasia Semenov: Just have to wait and see how it all plays out I guess.
[17:58:32] Tanya L. Fredrickson: I mean the combine saved us basically, in my opinion.
[17:59:00] Tanya L. Fredrickson: We were facing what, overpopulation, wars, starvation, an ecomic crisis, hate? 
[17:59:09] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Global warming, the list goes on.
[17:59:30] Tanya L. Fredrickson: They basically forced us to smarten up and actually do something useful rather the squabbling resources.
[17:59:49] Anastasia Semenov: And yet the squabbling was a better way to live.
[17:59:56] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Was it?
[18:00:16] Anastasia Semenov: Perhaps we should divert from this topic before people say some things that sound slightly anti-union.
[18:00:40] Tanya L. Fredrickson: My point proven, context is key Anastasia.
[18:00:48] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Either way, I enjoyed this conversation.
[18:00:56] Anastasia Semenov: As did I.
[18:01:34] Tanya L. Fredrickson: If you want to have another I will always talk with you about anything.
[18:01:50] Anastasia Semenov: Perhaps if we cross again.
[18:01:55] Tanya L. Fredrickson: We will
[18:02:18] Anastasia Semenov: Although if you don't see me again, either I died, or I joined the Civil Servants
[18:02:40] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Trust me, Ill see you either way.
[18:02:49] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Dead or injured.
[18:03:30] Anastasia Semenov: That is if you get put on medical staff.
[18:04:46] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Fair enough.
[18:04:57] Tanya L. Fredrickson: When's this work station gonna open, I am running outta oxygen...
[18:05:11] Anastasia Semenov: Probably not for awhile.
[18:05:25] Anastasia Semenov: You should invest in one of these masks. They don't require a filter change.
[18:05:37] Tanya L. Fredrickson: If I make it that long, if I make it that long.
[18:06:29] Anastasia Semenov: I'm sure you will.
[18:06:33] Anastasia Semenov: Just stay close to a vent.

"Oh- Uh.... here." he'd quietly mutter out, the card trembling within his weakened, malnourished and skinny fingertips.
[18:38:55] Anastasia Semenov: .// He went to go process someone btw
[18:39:37] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /me would take the card from the citizen's hand, not really snatching it but not taking it gently either. He holds his arm up so the card faces the light and looks it over, clearly scrutinizing it, both front and back, likely checking if it's counterfeit.

[18:41:28] Adam Riley: /me stepped up a little further towards the large and imposing light-gate, both hands slowly placing behind his back. His breathing nerve-ridden and audible due to the mask that lay over his face, awaiting the officer's return patiently.

[18:43:21] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /me leaves his fenced in area and steps back to the citizen. He stands with his hands at his sides , straight and crisp, as if his body were as laundry-pressed as his uniform. He looks forward to the man with a gaze that doesn't break, imposing himself on the man's field of vision. He speaks:
[18:43:37] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: I've got a few questions for you to start. First off, what's your date of birth?
[18:43:39] Anastasia Semenov: /me sighs. "Y'know you really are a debbie."

[18:44:19] Tanya L. Fredrickson: /me pats their shoulder.
[18:44:37] Anastasia Semenov: /me shrugs. "You're right."
[18:45:05] Anastasia Semenov: Jeez I hate to be impatient, but what can be taking so long.
[18:45:32] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Dementia dude rolled through here when I arrived
[18:45:38] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Safe to assume sames happening now
[18:45:41] Adam Riley: /me 's own uniform was dirtied, creased and a complete contrast to the officer's clearly far cleaner uniform, the mask had a dusty hue around it as if he wasn't the only one to have used it with being a new arrival and all. "Date of birth? Hm... 1981, Third of January."
[18:45:48] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Lets go check it out
[18:45:54] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /pm ana sorry, this guy takes a very long time to do paragraph /me's
[18:45:57] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /pm fred sorry, this guy takes a very long time to do paragraph /me's
[18:46:23] Tanya L. Fredrickson: You try to ruin my day, i wanna know whatcha got
[18:46:35] Anastasia Semenov: Hovv do you mean?
[18:47:13] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /me pulls out his scratched-up PDA from his utility belt. It looks like it's taken a few drops, a few falls, maybe a scuffle or two. He types in the man's CID number and opens up his datafile, then types in his date, somewhat quickly. He's used to typing these things at this point.
[18:47:31] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /viewdata ad
[18:48:10] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: And you're a male, correct?
[18:48:41] Adam Riley: /me kept his posture firm despite his filth-ridden clothing, a proper, strong and imposing posture with both hands firmly behind his back. "I am a male." he'd bluntly respond, obviously not wanting to take up any more of the officer's time than he had to, that or he was too afraid to make idle chatter.
[18:49:44] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Alright, I figured. Do you know your blood type? If not, I can mark it as Unknown.
[18:50:02] Adam Riley: Unknown I would suppose. I'm not sure about that. Sorry.
[18:50:17] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /me looks back down to his PDA and hits a single button.
[18:50:21] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /viewdata adam
[18:50:33] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Any mental or physical disabilities or disorders?
[18:51:07] Adam Riley: /me gave a shake of his head, followed by the sound of his rubber and cloth uniform shifting along his shoulders, offering no response other than another laboured breath through the masl.
[18:51:11] Adam Riley: /it mask*
[18:52:04] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Alright, that'll be all, then. If you need filters, you can find them at any local store, but if all the regular ones are closed, there's a 24/7 one in the plaza that always does.
[18:52:26] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: You're safe to take off your suit as long as you're near an air vent, you can find them around the city in every apartment and most interiors.
[18:53:03] Adam Riley: Alright- thank you. I'll be sure to try and find the store. I'm not very used to this uniform stuff. I'm sure I'll get the hang of it- I'll have to.
[18:53:12] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: .//if you're not sure if something is an air vent you can look at it. functioning air vents have a tooltip
[18:53:19] Adam Riley: .// Alright, thank you again.
[18:53:31] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: .//yeah, no problem. if you have any other questions for me don't hesitate to ask
[18:53:35] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Fantastic.
[18:53:46] Adam Riley: .// I'll be sure to PM you if I have any. Appreciate the help.
[18:53:50] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /me would hold out the man's still-warm CID card for him to take, his arm outstretched fully.
[18:55:12] Adam Riley: /me pulled a single hand from behind his back to gently pluck the card from the officer's hand, trying to be as polite as possible, even coming off as a little timid, though maintaining one hand behind himself still, holding the card within his fingers alike the coupon. "Thank you very much. Time to explore a new city!" he'd give in a slightly more optimistic and cheery tone.
[18:55:50] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /me doesn't really give positivity back to the man. He responds flatly with a single sentence before stepping out of the way so he can exit the train station.
[18:55:56] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Stay out of trouble.
[18:57:01] Adam Riley: /me trailed off his cheery tone with a slight grumble seeing how the officer hadn't shared his newly found enthusiasm, stepping his way forth to the light-gate. He give a little hesitation before stepping through, his figure being encompassed by the light for a moment. His footsteps clacking away against the concrete as he made his way. "Certainly."
[18:57:13] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Welcome to the city!
[18:57:33] Anastasia Semenov: /me waves slightly. "Sup dude."
[18:58:42] Anastasia Semenov: /pm i3 the suspense if painful.. what's he gonna do
[18:58:45] Adam Riley: /me casually made his way past the greeting of the two new figures, as if completely blunting them. Be it cause of the eyes peering from behind himself, or the cramped nature of the dark adn dingy hallway that bowled as a strong wind-tunnel, his voice chirped out with a little timidness. "Uh- Hi." was all he gave out, before rudely making his way down the stairs, keeping to himself.
[18:59:21] Tanya L. Fredrickson: HAHA! Mission success, either way posters have been deployed poster captain.
[18:59:25] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: .//holy shit, sorry about the wait. that was

[18:59:56] Tanya L. Fredrickson: .// Eyo dab me up with 50 so I don't have to look like mike wazowskie on a bad day please.
[19:00:07] Anastasia Semenov: .// I'll take the extra LP one step closer to the goal in mind

"Hello there." he'd greet with a rather stern voice, muffled by the mask he donned that gave his voice a slight reverb also. "May I ask what you're doing here?" he'd quiz in that same stubborn tone.

Fredrickson: /me Looking at the sore state of afairs this window is in they would firmly slap the rag against it leaving a splatter mark on it as they spritz the window several times wiping away decades of absolutly disgusting materials, thusly coating the window in a sheet of clean shining previlent potent cleaning supplies.
[19:43:03] Tanya L. Fredrickson: /me Styling on these hoes they'd rub the clean side of the cloth on the coom covered glass, cleaning away chips of dirt and muck with ease before firmly spritzing it to give it a clean sheen.

[19:46:19] Tanya L. Fredrickson: /me looking over the disgusting window, they'd clean it promptly giving it no extra attention being totally bland and efficient having no emotion or love to it.

[20:00:46] Anna Gottlieb: Have a seat.
[20:00:57] Tanya L. Fredrickson: /me slides into the seat
[20:01:41] Anna Gottlieb: Alright, my name is Anna Gottlieb, I'm the interim director of the Civil Workers Union.
[20:01:55] Anna Gottlieb: I'm very glad we were able to meet so quickly, it's a pleasure to meet you
[20:02:17] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Likewise, was wondering when I would get to meet the fabled Anna Gottlleb.
[20:02:41] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Back in city eight everyone was talking about how good of a leader you were.
[20:03:15] Anna Gottlieb: ...Right.
[20:03:32] Anna Gottlieb: It's my understanding you wish to work for the Medical Corps, is that correct?
[20:03:53] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Indeed, would you like my refrences and background on medical matters.
[20:04:38] Anna Gottlieb: Well, references would be rather difficult to find nowadays, so let's hear about your background.
[20:07:24] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Well I have two seprate masters, one in human anatomy and the second in GC. I've had my medical license for about a decade now and I have tenure at my previous post underneath the regional manager at city eights central hospital, only reason I was taken off is because the city fell. That being said I also have a minor in phsycological care.
[20:08:14] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Aside from that I've also held a post as an EMT in city eight but that kinda fell through once the doctor shortage cropped up.
[20:08:49] Anna Gottlieb: alright..
[20:09:23] Anna Gottlieb: And what are your thoughts on the Universal Union? I'm looking for an honest answer, not a kissy-uppy one.
[20:10:02] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Honest one?
[20:10:15] Tanya L. Fredrickson: This is gonna take a second so mind if I get a drink real quick?
[20:11:41] Anna Gottlieb: I'd prefere if you jsut got to the meat of the interivew.
[20:13:43] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Fair enough, uh well basics of it are I think the previous form of government and overal world view of humanity was kind of inefficient and ineffective, I mean they saved us from what probably would've been a worse future by forcing us into our roles if anything they are better then any prior government by tenfold if not a thousand fold, we have what? Clean and effecient ways to manage cities of people who all have one designated goal which is to make the world a better place every day? Free food, free hou-
[20:14:01] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Housing so long as you are a decent citizen, and protection from anything the xenian invasion brought over.
[20:14:18] Tanya L. Fredrickson: they solved our resource problems and are allowing us to still hold governmental positions to boot.
[20:15:39] Anna Gottlieb: //guys
[20:15:41] Anna Gottlieb: //good news
[20:15:51] Tanya L. Fredrickson: // oh?

[20:19:43] Anna Gottlieb: //some other stuff i can't remember of fthe top of my head

[20:20:58] Anna Gottlieb: .//if you want you can just send me $100 and i'll use it to pad my bank account
[20:21:01] Anna Gottlieb: .//joking
[20:21:19] Anna Gottlieb: Well, we're always needing doctors, so, I'd say you're ready to go.
[20:21:27] Anna Gottlieb: Welcome to the Medical Corps. Here's a copy of your handbook...
[20:21:33] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Wait-
[20:21:39] Anna Gottlieb: /me would pull a handbook out from her desk and hand it to Tanya.
[20:21:49] Tanya L. Fredrickson: What do you want me to be specifically, just a GS or a ground floor practitioner?
[20:22:01] Tanya L. Fredrickson: EMT? Or just...
[20:22:52] Anna Gottlieb: Given the very unpopulated nature of the medical corps, you would be a ground floor practictioner, helping mainly with bumps and bruises, but your role will be fairly nebulous given that our medical corps in this precinct is extremely understaffed.
[20:23:11] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Easy enough, so I am basically doing everything
[20:23:15] Tanya L. Fredrickson: What's the pay like?
[20:23:25] Anna Gottlieb: I believe that's covered in the handbook.
[20:23:35] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Oh, well
[20:23:38] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Good day then.
[20:24:34] Anna Gottlieb: Likewise. I'll have someone get you your ID card and your uniform soon.
[20:26:06] Anna Gottlieb: //alright i'm heading over to my GF's soon, chances are decent i'll be back on when i get back
[20:26:16] Anna Gottlieb: //but if not you should join the discord if you're not already in it. /discord to join
