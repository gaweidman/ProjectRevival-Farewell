[19:22:02] Todd Muller: /me Looks at the man and the CP-unit talking, before leaning down to the paint can, cracking it open, then dipping the bait brush into the paint, then turning to the bench.
[19:22:13] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: ...What happened?
[19:22:20] Carson Copper: Was only just a scratch on the surface n'- oh. Eh-. Well.
[19:22:27] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: Ah, an abrasion.
[19:22:37] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: I got a bunch of those before I first started wearing my CP mask.

[19:23:05] Carson Copper: I got mauled by a zombie
[19:23:09] Todd Muller: /ME Leans up a tiny bit, starting to paint the top of the bench, the spot where you rest your back on.
[19:23:13] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: Holy shit.
[19:23:24] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: What were you doing to be near one of those?
[19:23:30] Carson Copper: /me then slowly raises one of his fingers, pointing directly down the street, "Yeah- Just down there is where it happened- been almost a week or so since."
[19:23:43] Todd Muller: /me Slowly moves to the other side of the bench, painting the rest of the back area.
[19:23:43] Carson Copper: I didn't want to be near it- it came from the roofs n' jumped on me.
[19:23:50] Carson Copper: Luckaly I wasn't alone when it happened.
[19:23:54] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: hm. Alright.
[19:24:22] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: Recover quickly, those zombies can leave some bad cuts. Take it from someone who's seen a sewer door in City 18 go down.
[19:24:37] Carson Copper: /me he scratches his back a bit, "My eye wasn't the only thing that got most of the blows. My back is covered in scratches - Likely scars now."
[19:24:44] Carson Copper: Oh I'm on meds' sir, I should be fine.
[19:24:51] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: Good.
[19:24:58] Todd Muller: /me After finishing the top of the bench, he would move to the seat area, slowly starting to paint the left side with darker orange paint.
