[17:17:07] Journey Robertson: I found one.
[17:17:11] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: Ah, really now
[17:17:17] Journey Robertson: In a secret base with a ton of rebel shit
[17:17:22] Journey Robertson: It's topside
[17:17:23] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: Where?
[17:17:27] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: Okay... Show me.
[17:17:39] Journey Robertson: Alright, I didn't see any units so we should be able to get there.
[17:19:23] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: Ahh, I'll be damned.
[17:19:40] Journey Robertson: I found this via a few letters some rebels put down
[17:19:47] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: /me would bring his radio out, trying to synchronize it with the repeater.
[17:20:11] Journey Robertson: It was a cache of weapons and stuff, my friend took some of the shit.

[17:22:06] Journey Robertson: this works for my friend, maybe the walkie talkie you have is just broken?
[17:22:12] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: No, no. It works.
[17:22:15] Journey Robertson: I see
[17:22:21] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: It only works with certain walkie talkies, howerver.

[17:34:53] Journey Robertson: .// IC he's a lucky dog though
[17:35:00] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: .// if this server was more populated and they put max player to 128 then yes
[17:35:08] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: .// you would be able to do a lot of things
[17:35:26] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: .// q and the staff are just learning still, i can tell. Compared to Nebulous, they have a looong way to go
[17:36:03] Journey Robertson: .// Yeah, but the problem with Nebulous is that it doesn't really care for the individual player...which sucks ass in my opinion.
[17:36:13] Journey Robertson: .// I respect the server.
[17:36:19] Journey Robertson: .// And what it's done
[17:36:21] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: .// yeah, its more of an item grinding play style
[17:36:31] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: .// and its consequences are harsh.
[17:36:32] Journey Robertson: .// True, I personally don't like the server.
[17:36:44] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: .// it takes a good week to get a single pipe
[17:37:02] Journey Robertson: .// In this server you can get one via picking one up in a trash pile lmao.
[17:37:16] Journey Robertson: .// Only a few things should take weeks to make.
[17:37:21] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: .// i know... they should make it harder though, so everyone isnt just running around with guns
[17:37:23] Journey Robertson: .// guns, ammo, armor.

[17:38:46] Journey Robertson: .// See....the problem with that is......it takes a good bit of skill to beat a unit with a pipe with RP combat.
[17:38:51] Journey Robertson: .// And also luck

[17:39:49] CCA.C14-GRID.i4.36307: /toggleraise
[17:40:06] Journey Robertson: .// Also the shooting out legs mechanic is OP as shit.
[17:40:20] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: .// yeah, i just feel like pipes and stuff wouldn't just be laying around on the surface, like literally i just came across bullet casings, scrap metal, and wiring... In a city where the combine run stuff, they wouldn't just let that type of shit sit aroun
[17:40:44] Journey Robertson: .// The fuck, you found bullet casings?
[17:40:49] Journey Robertson: .// I have never found that shit
[17:41:02] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: .// come my friend
