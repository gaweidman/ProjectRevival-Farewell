[21:19:36] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: You want loyalist points?
[21:19:44] Kane Davis: /me nods, slowly.

[21:19:47] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Identifications please.

[21:20:07] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: /viewdata Kane
[21:20:35] Kane Davis: I left a note on the work desk. I have experience with plumbing if the city needs it.
[21:20:53] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Interesting, I didn't think we'd get random Joe's to carry and walk with cremator heads.
[21:21:12] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Don't toss that stuff on the work desk, we try to keep it clean as is.
[21:21:19] Kane Davis: Better my hands to be full than a unit such as yourself.
[21:21:23] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: That information is good with the workers union, not us.
[21:21:48] Kane Davis: Right, I can move the note to the Worker's office, that makes more sense.
[21:21:53] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Alright here's what we're gonna do, I'll have you bring that paper to one of the near Offices of the workers union.
[21:21:55] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Come with me.
[21:22:13] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: /me he eyes the paper for a moment
[21:22:34] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Old world repairs eh?
[21:22:46] Kane Davis: Don't see many plumbers around anymore, do you?
[21:22:52] Kane Davis: But we still need plumbing.
[21:23:01] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Alright mr. Plumber
[21:23:05] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: I've got a question
[21:23:16] Kane Davis: Shoot.
[21:23:46] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: What's the standard gauge used for pipes in most common household sinks?
[21:23:49] Kane Davis: /me bites both his upper and bottom lips at the same time sucking in his lips.
[21:24:01] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: /me he recoils for a moment, almost holding back something
[21:25:47] Kane Davis: Well, what country we talking here is the question, and what kind of pipes are being used. There's no simple answer.
[21:26:08] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: /me he lets out a bit of laughter, "Ah- I'm just messing with you, no need to be so serious."
[21:26:08] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: haha
[21:26:15] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Just checkin' if your the real deal' is all.
[21:26:33] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Alright pick up ya' papers, you've just given me an idea.
[21:26:41] Kane Davis: Rightt.
[21:27:07] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Should be fine just having it on this desk here.
[21:27:29] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Now, where is it that you'd like to start working on? for *Plumbing* of course.
[21:27:46] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: The areas you describe as in dire need of maintenance. 
[21:28:28] Kane Davis: /me places the paper gently down on the desk, "Well, I have a few places in mind. I've noticed some places around here are kept in better care than others, so the city might want me to focus more on somewhere else."
[21:28:52] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Somewhere else, eh?
[21:28:59] Kane Davis: Well what I mean is.
[21:29:02] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Any of the housing blocks come to mind?
[21:29:44] Kane Davis: I've noticed the blocks contained here on this street are a little more cared for than the buildings on the trainstation block.
[21:29:59] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Then let us go there.
[21:30:40] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: This otta' be one of the places.
[21:30:41] Kane Davis: This bulding here, I almost don't even want to go inside.
[21:30:55] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Not even if it'll get you loyalist points?
[21:31:30] Kane Davis: /me removes a flashlight from his pants, flicking it on, "I'll do whatever is needed of me. I firgure I'll take the initiative and start here."
[21:32:20] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Do your thing, just let me know if you need anything. Main goal right now I want ya' to do is to find out what you'll need to fix up the place.
[21:32:33] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Don't think of things *too* big, but minor fixes n' what not.
[21:32:44] Kane Davis: Ah, I'll try to get a full report on it. 
[21:32:51] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Perfect.
[21:32:55] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: I'll be here.
[21:33:13] Kane Davis: /me turns walking over to the door.
[21:33:33] Kane Davis: Officer, real quick question for you, it may seem strange... But if you'll humor me a little bit?
[21:33:49] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Sure, what's up?
[21:34:25] Kane Davis: In the simplest way you can can you tell me...
[21:34:41] Kane Davis: What does it feel like to be apart of the system?
[21:35:05] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Of the system? 
[21:35:20] Kane Davis: Yes. Our system.
[21:35:57] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: The system of the universal union, or our way of life affected by those of our new *friends?* 
[21:36:18] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Feels the same as things did thirty, hell fourty years ago.
[21:36:54] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: This *system* is always there. You and I have been apart of it our whole lives.
[21:37:47] Kane Davis: /me smiles and nods his head, "I couldn't agree with you more. Thank you for answering, it's always uhm- Interesting."
[21:38:00] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: I suppose.
[21:38:19] Kane Davis: Alright, I'll get to work. Should not take me too long to do quick inspections.
[21:38:26] Kane Davis: /me turns once again and opens the door.
[21:38:47] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Damn animal walkin' through the cameras again.
[21:39:07] Kane Davis: Ah, no running water.
[21:40:19] Kane Davis: Not safe,.
[21:40:50] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: How are we?
[21:41:22] Kane Davis: Alright, I've got to say. There's absolutely no running water. And the place is a dump. you should really talk to someone about just making this place a no-go for anyone.
[21:41:49] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Well Fabrication wasn't made for quality.
[21:42:13] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: But that's good enough of an assessment for me.
[21:42:32] Kane Davis: The bulding is gonna collapse and I'd worry about people getting diseases in there. Black mold. Hazardous degrading construction.
[21:42:56] Kane Davis: /me motions to the other bulding down the block, "Then that one."
[21:42:57] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Well we all wear masks. I'm sure people will be fine.
[21:43:09] Kane Davis: Ah, yeah, didn't think about that one.
[21:43:34] Kane Davis: Alright.. Let's see here.
[21:43:51] Kane Davis: Hmmm. A little barren.
[21:44:01] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Perhaps this place could be used as *group* but quite barren yes.
[21:44:29] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Well I think you've done enough for now. Meet me at the desk.
[21:44:35] Kane Davis: /me removes hisbackpack, pulling out a water.
[21:45:06] Kane Davis: office.
[21:45:34] Kane Davis: Officer.
[21:45:37] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Yes?
[21:45:49] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: /me he pulls out his PDA and would begin to type in something
[21:45:52] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: /viewdata Kane
[21:45:54] Kane Davis: Before we go any further with anything, I have to inform you of something.
[21:46:01] Kane Davis: /me places his backpack down on the desk.
[21:46:04] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Please do.
[21:46:12] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: What's this?
[21:46:53] Kane Davis: I was reading the city information and I think I discovered either, level Red contriband, or yellow. How ever an inestigator would want to look at it.
[21:47:02] Kane Davis: If you'd like to go inside and retrieve it yourself.
[21:47:15] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Interesting.
[21:47:29] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Where did you discover these items, or rather item?
[21:48:02] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: /me he unclips the suitcase and opens it up peering inside
[21:48:19] Kane Davis: Well, I found it in the alleyways... Ah, district four?
[21:48:46] Kane Davis: It's either a weapon, or it's industrialized equipment as I can read from the city penal codes.
[21:48:55] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Hmm... This would be borderline contraband it seems.
[21:49:29] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Often crowbars would be used as a *tool* and not a weapon, I'll look into this a bit futher. One moment.
[21:49:41] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: /me he pulls out his PDA and would begin searching through something
[21:49:52] Kane Davis: Indutrialized equipment then, a yellow contriband.
[21:50:04] Kane Davis: [[ industrial 
[21:50:55] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: The filter is fine, the chips are fine, the flashlights are fine, the only thing that's in question right now it seems would be the crowbar
[21:51:16] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Ah yes. Perfect.
[21:51:45] Kane Davis: Yes, as I've stated. It's a weapon, red colored, or it's industrial equipment, yellow colored.
[21:51:54] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Yep.
[21:51:57] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: I'll be taking this
[21:52:11] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: /me he grabs teh crowbar from the suitcase / table, and places it aside
[21:52:13] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: .// the*
[21:52:37] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: /me he would then raise his PDA and begins typing something
[21:52:44] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: /viewdata Kane
[21:53:48] Kane Davis: I found it in the alleyways where the cameras are blind. In my opinion, I think someone could have placed it there to hide. Amongst some papers, I happened to step on. Then I stub my boot on that.
[21:54:31] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Goodness well.
[21:54:50] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: /me he lowers his PDA, "You're currently sitting at seven loyalist points now due to your current actions."
[21:54:55] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Good job
[21:55:39] Kane Davis: /me nods with a big grin, "Amazing, that puts me in place for a Loyalist Armband, correct?
[21:55:54] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Correct, to which unfortunetly I have no way of giving you.
[21:56:12] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: You'll likely have to get in contact with other officers as of right now.
[21:56:22] Kane Davis: No worries, it's just a badge. It's the points that count.
[21:56:49] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: But you will have the rightful amount of rewards given in terms of respect and ration reward.
[21:57:04] Kane Davis: You think a ration cycle can be ran soon'?
[21:57:26] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Our cycles are determined by our superiors.
[21:57:54] Kane Davis: Alright then, well I guess that's it.
[21:58:05] CCA.C08-UNION.i1.93347: Right on. Have a good one.
[21:58:16] Kane Davis: /me nods, "You too."
