[19:06:27] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: It's mostly the reason I wanted to stop being a ground unit...
[19:06:46] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: So I could escape having to deal with those situations....
[19:07:10] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: Shit where.....everything around you is falling apart......the higher ranking units have no idea what to do....
[19:07:23] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: Even the SEC says shit is fucked.....

[19:13:22] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: Hm
[19:13:47] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: It would probably be more of a UNION investigation so not like you need to know.
[19:14:14] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: Hm...wonder if JUDGE is getting on the investigation as well.
[19:14:30] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: I remember the JUDGE OfC....that guy is scary.

[20:42:36] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: /radio It... What?
[20:42:40] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: /radio yeah
[20:42:44] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: /radio gone
[20:42:59] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: /radio Unknown reason.
[20:43:06] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: that is 
[20:43:09] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: very much gone
[20:43:22] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: I'm assuming some greedy ass high ranking unit took it or whatever.
[20:43:30] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: ugh
[20:43:31] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: I doubt some rebel got in here
[20:43:42] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: I will report it in, and see what Dispatch advises
[20:43:45] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: Good
[20:43:59] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: If I find who did it they will see a complaint directly to the SeC about it
[20:44:08] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: /me talks into his radio, clearly asking about the supply crate being gone, and how to proceed.
[20:44:15] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: good
[20:44:15] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: This is shit thats fucking over all of the CCA
[20:44:32] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: do you know why they restricted the Shotgun all of a sudden?
[20:44:49] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: I used to use it, but then they just randomly restricted it to the Overwatch Transhumans.
[20:44:55] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: No clue
[20:44:59] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: .// thats right im taking it ic
[20:45:12] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: hm
[20:45:13] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: Probably just because the Franchi spas 12 is really powerful
[20:45:19] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: but
[20:45:25] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: This might make you feel better
[20:45:34] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: /me Holds out a MP7 for the JUDGE boi

[20:45:53] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: ah. Thank you. That is also quite the fine weapon
[20:46:22] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: Thats my personal MP7, until I get the supply crate back I won't have a Primary
[20:46:29] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: punctures holes in the damned rebels like a train going through a piece of paper
[20:46:33] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: Indeed
[20:46:45] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: I'll be sure to return it when the supply crate returns
[20:46:45] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: Thanks to the amazing design from H&K
[20:46:48] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: Thanks
[20:46:57] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: Indeed. They seemed to have made a lot of our weapons
[20:47:14] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: Mostly because they strive on making simply but affective guns
[20:47:37] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: We even copied off of the cut OICW and made the PDW variant of it that SqL and above units can use.
[20:48:01] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: Hah. Even Our Benefactors like their designs.
[20:48:06] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: Seems so
[20:48:15] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: Good to see you on duty by the way.
[20:48:27] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: Being QrM I don't get to see old friends that much.
[20:48:56] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: I suppose it is nice to see one of the few faces that survived the hellhole of City 08.
[20:48:59] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: that was such a mess
[20:49:06] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: ugh......fucking hell it was...
[20:49:18] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: I still have night terrors about how fucked it was..
[20:49:47] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: If I had any real emotion at that point, it sure as hell drained it from me
[20:49:58] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: I still don't even entirely know what happened
[20:50:17] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: ugh.....I don't even think our HELIX DvL friend knows entirely.
[20:50:42] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: We were pretty much just told everything was going to shit.
[20:50:48] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: yeah
[20:51:15] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: though I will admit, something about the SeC of 08 telling the citizens everything is fine, and immediately radioing us telling it was not, was humorous.
[20:51:24] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: Indeed it was
[20:51:34] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: haha
[20:51:47] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: But also...a little scary to think that even the SeC couldn't do shit about it.
[20:52:27] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: Sometimes I wonder about situations like that, where even the SeC can't really do anything.
[20:52:35] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: I don't want to.
[20:52:44] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: but...I will admit it's interesting.
[20:52:54] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: I shouldn't, it's far beyond what i'm assigned to. But being a JUDGE, intuition is natural.
[20:52:57] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: .// Bruh Pain is insulting beta Elite OTA ;-;
[20:53:04] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: true.

[20:53:28] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: I simply need to support those who are fighting for the right cause.
[20:53:34] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: Affirmative
[20:53:42] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: hey, do you remember the bleach incident?

[20:53:51] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: haha
[20:54:01] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: I was telling the GRID i4 about that not long ago.
[20:54:17] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: I still cannot fucking believe that happened in front of our own eyes
[20:54:21] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: Honestly
[20:54:25] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: haha
[20:54:26] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: way too fucking funny
[20:54:34] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: I just...
[20:55:00] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: He had his mask on, I don't even know how he drank it. And then that other dumbass drank it.
[20:55:06] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: or...
[20:55:09] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: did he take it off?
[20:55:22] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: don't remember, laughed too hard
[20:55:22] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: No fucking clue, wonder why he even did it?
[20:55:30] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: 10-103M, likely.
[20:55:43] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: Wonder if the fucking i5's were doing deals...or 10-103m
[20:56:16] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: But.....even then it's unlikely that the i5's were being that fucking inept.
[20:56:28] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: They atleast have common sense.
[20:56:51] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: .// Fucking love that modern Beta Elite.
[20:57:00] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: true

[20:57:40] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: True....I still remember the fucking CWU HQ being infested.
[20:57:47] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: ugh
[20:57:59] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: That was in my early days.

[21:06:00] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: I swear, i'm gonna start forcing Civvies to make shit if they keep forcing me to work with five Mp7's
[21:06:06] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: Of course
