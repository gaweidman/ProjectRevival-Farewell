[13:39:31] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: Hmph. That'd be nice. Slap a stock on the MP7, and it's more a laser than it already is.
[13:39:51] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: True, I was also thinking of some type of muzzle brake.
[13:40:23] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: It would help with lowering the recoil even further, making it some form of ballistic laser gun.

[13:42:21] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: And looking at the flaws in the AR2 i'm impressed he can even run with it.
[13:42:51] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: True enough. Don't you have to hold it by the magazine?
[13:43:14] CCA.C14-QrM.98240: It has a really shitty grip on it so nobody I've ever seen uses the grip.

[15:58:06] James Albright: We still have contat with him. He just can't continue this work.
[15:58:18] James Albright: I'm a mechanic and a technological person myself.
[15:58:25] James Albright: Yet I can't for the life of me figure out the cremators.
[15:58:31] James Albright: Have you peeked under the hood of one?
[15:58:43] Journey Robertson: I haven't and don't wish to.....
[15:59:12] James Albright: It's all just skinny bits, for the most part.
[15:59:19] James Albright: Yet they make these things in regular work cycles.
[15:59:28] James Albright: Seventeen loves to make them.
[15:59:35] James Albright: You ever see those spinning wheels in 17's factories?
[15:59:47] James Albright: They looked like a weird fan or a weird propeller?
[15:59:50] James Albright: .//this was a real thing in the map
[15:59:53] Journey Robertson: .// Bruh
[15:59:58] Journey Robertson: I believe so.
[16:00:01] James Albright: .//all beta inspired
[16:00:02] James Albright: .//so
[16:00:04] James Albright: .//thats what you get
[16:00:09] James Albright: Those are used to make cremator heads.
[16:00:20] Journey Robertson: Hm......
[16:00:25] James Albright: We have people like you and I making artificial intelligence without fucking knowing t.

[16:00:47] James Albright: //:(
[16:00:53] Leman Russ: // tuff
[16:00:56] Journey Robertson: Damn......but looking at how the Combine normally act this isn't......as suprising as I wish it was.
[16:00:57] James Albright: My point is, we're well equipped.
[16:01:03] Journey Robertson: Good to hear
[16:01:06] James Albright: No, but it is fasinating.
[16:01:17] James Albright: This piece is one that I quite like.
[16:01:30] Journey Robertson: What is it if you don't mind me asking.
[16:01:47] James Albright: From what the limited amount we can read about it says, it was a piece of technology meant to emulate something at black mesa.
[16:01:58] Journey Robertson: Weird...
[16:02:02] James Albright: As you can imagine, the Russians wanted that technology badly.
[16:02:10] Journey Robertson: Indeed
[16:02:55] James Albright: It's got something to do with exotic matter.
[16:03:01] James Albright: Things that we normally wouldn't see.
[16:03:12] James Albright: We're not sure what else.
[16:03:22] James Albright: Those of us that know russian can't read all the scientific words.
[16:03:24] Journey Robertson: If only I worked with technology pre-war.
[16:03:31] Journey Robertson: Damn....
[16:03:32] James Albright: They know conversational russian, not scientific russian.
[16:03:47] James Albright: Anyways.
[16:04:03] James Albright: Wait, were you about to say something?
[16:04:19] Journey Robertson: No...i'm mostly just listening.
[16:04:26] James Albright: Here
[16:04:28] James Albright: .//shit
[16:04:30] James Albright: Here's something.
[16:04:34] James Albright: See this book?
[16:04:40] Journey Robertson: Indeed
[16:04:40] James Albright: "From here to there in under a second."
[16:04:48] James Albright: It's a book by one Isaac Kleiner.
[16:04:55] James Albright: He was one of the people at the top of his field.
[16:05:02] James Albright: I followed a lot of scientific media back in the day.
[16:05:09] James Albright: .//in canon kleiner was like a really famous scientist back in the day
[16:05:17] Journey Robertson: .// GAMER
[16:05:28] James Albright: .//like sort of like neil degrasse tyson
[16:05:30] Journey Robertson: I would imagine he had something to do with Black Mesa.
[16:05:34] Journey Robertson: .// Yee
[16:05:36] James Albright: Right you are.
[16:05:51] James Albright: It's his thoughts about teleportation and the like.
[16:06:07] James Albright: What I would give to meet him.
[16:06:30] Journey Robertson: Yeah......you said teleportation......was this guy trying to make such things?
[16:06:40] James Albright: Well, it's funny.
[16:06:49] James Albright: Rumor has it black mesa was working on teleportation.
[16:06:58] James Albright: As a top secret project.
[16:07:08] Journey Robertson: Damn......obviously it didn't go out the way we intended.
[16:07:11] James Albright: But as the media says, he worked in Anomalous Materials.
[16:07:20] James Albright: Whatever that means.
[16:07:24] James Albright: Point is it's not teleportation.
[16:07:43] James Albright: So I think it was just him talking about what he thought would be cool.
[16:07:49] James Albright: Scientific self-fanfiction, if you will.
[16:08:00] Journey Robertson: Interesting.
[16:08:09] James Albright: Some people say that was all a farce.
[16:08:20] James Albright: And he worked in the rumored teleportation studies.
[16:08:28] James Albright: Personally, I don't give a flying fuck.
[16:08:50] Journey Robertson: Well......if this guy is so high up in the scientific community I wouldn't be suprised if he was touching up on teleportation.
[16:08:56] James Albright: Yeah.
[16:09:07] James Albright: The poor man died in the Incident, so we'll never know.
[16:09:12] Journey Robertson: Damn

[16:09:54] Journey Robertson: I wasn't planning on it......from first glance of course.

[16:10:57] Journey Robertson: "Portal" storms?
[16:11:04] James Albright: We keep these as a reminder of what happened.
[16:11:05] James Albright: Yeah.
[16:11:15] Journey Robertson: I don't exactly know what that is.
[16:11:24] Journey Robertson: I can guess though
[16:11:38] James Albright: Those blue waves that came all across earth, destroying things in the process and bringing those aliens with?
[16:11:59] Journey Robertson: Hm......oh that, I was not aware that those were called Portal storms.
[16:12:10] Journey Robertson: Good to know the name.
[16:12:14] James Albright: That's what we called it.
[16:12:20] James Albright: /chargiveflag james I

[16:12:57] Journey Robertson: Sadly
[16:13:04] James Albright: Nah, everybody already ate.
[16:13:11] James Albright: We've actually got a pretty good cook in there
[16:13:18] Journey Robertson: Nice to know.
[16:13:19] James Albright: Makes the best beef stroganoff you've ever had.
[16:13:45] James Albright: We got this room.
[16:13:49] James Albright: This is just a...
[16:13:53] James Albright: More private room.
[16:13:59] Journey Robertson: I won't go in it then.
[16:14:12] James Albright: Essentially it's where us higher ups go in to talk about things when they're getting really bad.
[16:14:20] Journey Robertson: Ahh
[16:14:22] Journey Robertson: I see
[16:14:24] James Albright: So we don't freak the fuck out of the people
[16:14:32] James Albright: By talking about it in front of them.
[16:14:37] Journey Robertson: Good to know
[16:14:39] James Albright: Y'know, the thing every parent does.
[16:15:03] James Albright: This is our security sytsem.

[16:15:36] James Albright: .//wtf void tat i'm stupid
[16:15:41] Journey Robertson: .// Lmao
[16:15:55] James Albright: No, the combine is just really not as technologically advanced as they'd like you to believe.
[16:16:04] James Albright: In here is our prisoner room.
[16:16:10] James Albright: In here we've got a blind scanner.
[16:16:15] Journey Robertson: Damn

[16:16:35] Journey Robertson: They are almost cute.
[16:16:38] Journey Robertson: almost

[16:17:53] James Albright: No, it's the torture chair.
[16:17:59] James Albright: We don't have to use it much.
[16:18:01] Journey Robertson: I thought as much
[16:18:22] James Albright: But the idea of splattering ketchup everyone was novel.
[16:18:27] Journey Robertson: Really..
[16:18:32] James Albright: That's really it.

[16:19:12] Journey Robertson: Mostly because it seems to have the most zombies
[16:19:17] Journey Robertson: And it would be too risky alone
[16:19:18] James Albright: And it's fucking terrifying?
[16:19:31] Journey Robertson: That too, but the zombies are far worse to me.
[16:19:44] James Albright: Hm.
[16:19:45] James Albright: Alright.
[16:19:52] James Albright: We can look for them today.
[16:19:58] Journey Robertson: Wonderful
