[16:03:22] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: Alright, so..
[16:04:04] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: Medical Corps is complaining about this seak being leaky and having low water pressure. Nothing was changed with the water distribution, we've checked, but nobody in the Engineering Corps has been available to take a look. We're short on plumbers.
[16:04:11] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: .//this sink*, fuck
[16:04:21] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: So, we need you to get this fixed.
[16:04:31] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: It's leaking out that junction there between the curved and straight pipe.
[16:04:43] Kane Davis: Alright, I'll take a look at it and see what I can do.
[16:04:45] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: I've got a whole bag of plumbers' tools and regular tools, so, here you go.
[16:04:51] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: /me would place all of the things the man may need on the floor.
[16:05:03] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: .//i gotta take a tinkle on the binkle and i'm gonna get a small snack so brb back in like 5 minutes
[16:05:18] Kane Davis: /me kneels down, opening up the bag to take a gander at the tools.
[16:07:01] Kane Davis: /me quickly retrieves a UU branded single cigarette from his breast jacket pocket, he'd also receive a pack of UU branded matches. He would strike the match quickly lighting the cigarette, puffing and exhaling smoke without using his hands...
[16:07:55] Kane Davis: /me reaches into the bag grabbing a few tools and gently sliding them towards the sink. He'd then go over to the tools, squatting down underneath the sink.
[16:08:32] Kane Davis: /me checks the leak on the sink, he'd get up and turn the water on.
[16:09:55] Kane Davis: /me squats again and checks the leak while the water is running, "Right, right..." He'd say to himself still inhaling and exhaling smoke without usinghis hands.
[16:10:58] Kane Davis: /me turns off the water, quickly grabbing a proper gauge and tool, he'd begin loosening the pipe on the sink.
[16:11:41] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: .//i'm back
[16:11:51] Kane Davis: /me would then retrieve a metal tipped brush he threw over earlier out of the bag, scrubbing away at the inside of the pipe threads.
[16:11:54] Kane Davis: [[ welcome back
[16:13:09] Kane Davis: /me then retrieves a small vial of putty from the ground he also threw over earlier, applying it directly with his fingertip, around the pipe.
[16:13:58] Kane Davis: /me wipes his finger off on his pants, quickly he'd retrieve the gauge tool and begin once again tightening the pipe after putting it back in place.
[16:14:47] Kane Davis: So the problem was actually /too/ much weight put into the initial tightening of the pipes. Shouldn't exceed over 120 pounds, I'd say this was around 160.
[16:14:56] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: Alright..
[16:15:01] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: sounds good, then.
[16:15:42] Kane Davis: The water pressure probably has something to do with the water heater. I have no doubt it's uhm- Very old.
[16:16:09] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: Hey, you're not offending me, I didn't build this place.
[16:16:24] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: Makes sense though, most of the infrastructure is decades old.
[16:17:06] Kane Davis: But this sink won't leak anylonger. I've noticed, honestly, all the water heaters around here are definetly out of maintenance. Someone should possibly talk to whoever makes the decisions- To manufacture new ones.
[16:17:56] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: Alright, I'll see if I can talk to the ministry of housing about that.
[16:18:00] CCA.C08-GRID.i3.08313: .//totally didn't make that up on the spot
