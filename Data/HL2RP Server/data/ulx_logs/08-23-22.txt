[16:33:06] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: /me grabbed the man by the shoulder, bringing him forward to the Combine air vent near them. Forcing him to sit down he would dig into his pocket, grabbing an AI-2 medkit and flicking it open, utilizing several pain medications and what not to atleast semi-help him with his wounds. "This, first."
[16:33:14] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: /looc you CAN resist if you want

[16:34:22] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: /me rolled the mans sleeve back down, keeping it underneath his heavy gloves in order to ensure his suit is entirely sealed. Tossing the now empty AI-2 medkit to the side, he would tilt his head, orange visor glowing ever so slightly. "That better? any other pains or aches?"
[16:34:59] Denford F. MacMillian: /me would continue to let the Civil Protection unit to patch him up, slightly grunting as the medication was applied but eventually spoke up after he was done - "No officer, thank you for the help."

[16:38:25] Ryan Maley: //wait this isn't google
[16:38:56] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: /me sighed, stepping forward and grabbing the man  by the shoulder, turning him in a 180 if he showed no resistance and bringing him over to the wall underneath the vent. Once more he would dig into his pocket and take out yet another AI-2, utilizing the syringes within it to lessen his pain and fix any form of internal bleeding and or damage. "You citizens are always falling apart..."

[16:41:47] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: /me looked over Ryan, visor glowing ever so slightly of his silhouette. He would roll his shoulders silent, seemingly in thought, before simply saying. ".... It's the right thing, take care."

[16:43:49] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: I rather like that sentiment, but not everyone is like me, nor do I have much say in those matters.
[16:44:10] Denford F. MacMillian: I understand, would you like to write a few questions or are you currently occupied with your duties.

[16:56:20] Ethan King: Spying on it, reporting each time we leave and enter to ensure the Combine have a schedule on our movement, it's difficult to move with the prying eyes of the CWU on us.
[16:56:29] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Somebody made a mistake in your file, it's fixed now.

[17:02:30] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Are you ready for your training?
[17:02:45] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Yes sir.
[17:02:58] Ethan King: Rebels, all we do is sit in the sewers as the children up above squander in their cities, the Martyrs we call the Combine are keeping them in check.

[17:03:06] Ethan King: Be better for us 
[17:03:08] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Fantastic. Let's get into it.
[17:03:15] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: I'll get my favorite part out of the way, basic information.
[17:03:27] Ethan King: Kill him if you can, and you'll see the better side of us.
[17:03:37] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: So, divisions.
[17:03:54] James McKay: I'll...I'll try...But he's been getting a strange treatment...He's been closer and closer to CPs...
[17:03:59] Ethan King: /me simply turned a 180, grabbing at his MP7 and walking off. The slight sound of a safety being flipped can be heard as his silhouette dissapeared."
[17:04:06] James McKay: Not likely I could even scratch him...before...
[17:04:09] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: In the CCA, there are four divisions.
[17:04:15] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: UNION, GRID, JUDGE, and HELIX.
[17:04:24] James McKay: /ooc Thirdperson is a killer ain't it
[17:04:27] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Every unit is given a division except for very high ranks and very specific roles.

[17:04:38] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: We'll get there later.
[17:04:42] James McKay: Hm...
[17:04:54] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Because the CCA is so big, we need people do to auxilliary roles and have their own specializations.

[17:05:16] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: that said, you and all other units start out in UNION.
[17:05:17] Tyrone Adams: Yeah!
[17:05:20] James McKay: Eat shit!
[17:05:22] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: This is the standard, bread and butter division.
[17:05:24] Tyrone Adams: Haha!
[17:05:34] James McKay: You alright?
[17:05:36] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Ground soldiers?
[17:05:40] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Essentially
[17:05:50] Tyrone Adams: Yeah, ran out of filters a bit ago, but I'm fine now.
[17:05:58] James McKay: Ah alright...
[17:06:03] Tyrone Adams: Lookin' for a guy named uh...
[17:06:04] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: All divisions patrol and search apartments and take reports for crime, but Union does exclusively those things.
[17:06:07] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: It has no side job.
[17:06:08] Tyrone Adams: What was it, ah yes!
[17:06:13] Tyrone Adams: 'King'
[17:06:16] Tyrone Adams: I think.
[17:06:29] James McKay: King...Ah I saw em go that way...But I didn't plan on following him...
[17:06:32] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: That said, they specialize in it. Part of the perks of being a union unit is you get certain pieces of equipment earlier than other divisions.
[17:06:40] James McKay: /me Points towards the other side of the room, towards the doorway
[17:06:48] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Flashbangs, viscerators, smoke grenades, riot shields, all those.
[17:06:59] Tyrone Adams: He gave me a note-pad with some writing about 'rising up' or something like that.
[17:07:00] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Ok.
[17:07:03] Tyrone Adams: I wish to do so.
[17:07:21] James McKay: Well...From what I've been told, the best way to do so is to kill that orange suited guy...
[17:07:29] James McKay: Thats what King told me though...
[17:07:29] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: UNION units tend to be the first responders for civil unrest, things like riots and protests.
[17:07:31] Tyrone Adams: Ah, him.
[17:07:44] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Although other divisions will respond, UNION units will likely be asked before other divisions.
[17:07:46] James McKay: I guess he's a problem...But I couldn't tell...
[17:07:47] Tyrone Adams: I did a Workshift with him.
[17:07:49] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Alright, GRID.
[17:07:50] Tyrone Adams: Has like
[17:07:55] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: That's my division and my personal favorite.
[17:08:00] Tyrone Adams: 149 LP if I remember correctly.
[17:08:06] Tyrone Adams: Some crazy shit.
[17:08:19] James McKay: Well...He just seems to be a important, pen pushing garbage cleaner...
[17:08:27] Tyrone Adams: Wants to sign up for Administration
[17:08:34] Tyrone Adams: Yeah...
[17:08:53] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: We're the division of mechanics and trade workers. APC needs an oil change? Call GRID. Sentry gun is broken? Call GRID. Mask broken? Call GRID.
[17:08:57] James McKay: /me Shrugs "Well who wouldn't, You see what they eat! *Chuckles* They get actually solid food!"
[17:09:01] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Lower ranks do more grunt work, simple fixes.
[17:09:08] Tyrone Adams: Yeah, true that.
[17:09:19] Tyrone Adams: So, you want to go kill this guy?
[17:09:27] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Cleaning out the vents, putting up barriers, putting in biolocks.
[17:09:33] James McKay: Hah! Not a chance! You see how close to the CPs he is!
[17:09:38] Tyrone Adams: True that.
[17:09:44] James McKay: One step to close and the CPs will gun us down...
[17:09:54] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Higher-ish ranks do more skilled work. Building things, repairing things, all that.
[17:10:01] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: So you're a bunch of geniuses?
[17:10:02] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Middle ranks, you could call them.
[17:10:08] James McKay: I just say we let em be...Once he is in administration...Someone is bound to take his place...And be more...accepting...
[17:10:12] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Nobody likes a kissass, recruit.
[17:10:17] Tyrone Adams: Yeah.
[17:10:18] James McKay: Not like he can see us in the nexus...
[17:10:34] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Haha
[17:10:35] Tyrone Adams: Well, I'll be off to scavenge if you want to tag along.
[17:10:38] James McKay: I really think killing him would make shit worse for us....
[17:10:43] Tyrone Adams: Yeah, for real.
[17:10:46] James McKay: Yeah...That's what I was about to go do...
[17:10:48] Tyrone Adams: Didn't think it through.
[17:10:51] James McKay: Gotta make a living somehow...
[17:10:56] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Higher ranks work on much more complex things. Fixing broken synths, programming genetic farms, things like that.
[17:11:08] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The highest ranks can do their own research.
[17:11:23] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Interesting.
[17:11:28] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Alright, HELIX.
[17:11:29] James McKay: /ooc tf where did all of my skills just go...
[17:11:33] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //?
[17:11:34] James McKay: /ooc everything is legit lvl 0 now
[17:11:47] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //probably just a display bug, your character should be fine
[17:11:58] James McKay: /ooc Hopefully
[17:12:02] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: This one is pretty simple. Medical workers.
[17:12:13] James McKay: Ey...
[17:12:18] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Lower ranks fix boo-boos, higher ranks do surgeries.
[17:12:23] James McKay: I heard there was quite something in Shell Beach...
[17:12:29] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Extremely high ranks bioengineer synths, normally in tandem with GRID.
[17:12:37] Tyrone Adams: Hmmm, like?
[17:12:37] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: They also undergo memory replacement and unionwashing.
[17:12:53] James McKay: From what I've been told....Good components....I bet'll sell for a ton
[17:13:01] Tyrone Adams: Oh?
[17:13:07] James McKay: Bet that orange suit would buy it off us for god knows how much
[17:13:14] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Again, extremely high ranks do research.
[17:13:25] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: JUDGE is our last one here. Many people don't understand it fully.
[17:13:31] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: JUDGE is our division of investigators.
[17:13:40] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Like- detectives?
[17:13:43] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Exactly.
[17:13:46] James McKay: Woah...
[17:13:49] Tyrone Adams: Yeah...
[17:13:54] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: So they interrogate I assume.
[17:14:03] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: They *do* interrogate, but, we'll get there
[17:14:08] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Citizens think of them exclusively as interrogators and sociopaths. This is on purpose.
[17:14:09] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: /me nods.
[17:14:12] Tyrone Adams: Holy!
[17:14:16] James McKay: Hm?
[17:14:17] Tyrone Adams: Great stuff in here.
[17:14:36] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: An interrogation with a JUDGE unit isn't a deprived act of torture like some would have you believe.
[17:14:37] James McKay: Huh...A electric motor...Plexi glass...
[17:14:42] Tyrone Adams: I just got a Combine Air Tank.
[17:14:51] Tyrone Adams: If that's any good.
[17:14:52] James McKay: Heard that orange suit dude is buying a bunch of components since he got his shit hit...
[17:15:01] James McKay: Probably give it to a CP for somethin'
[17:15:02] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The difference between a JUDGE interrogation and a UNION one is that a JUDGE one has the reputation of forcefully removing answers from people.
[17:15:44] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Of course, we want it that way. We don't want unstable sociopaths in the CCA.
[17:16:02] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The idea is, you see a JUDGE unit, and you think, "I better not fuck around, because he'll *really* tear me a new one."
[17:16:07] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Got it?
[17:16:09] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Simple enough
[17:16:13] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Very.
[17:16:20] James McKay: You wanna try hit shell beach?
[17:16:24] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: any questionS?
[17:16:24] Tyrone Adams: Sure
[17:16:52] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //sorry about being elusive, i'm training the boy
[17:16:52] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Judge seems like people who take their jobs seriously. Does that necessarily mean they are harder to join?
[17:16:56] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //technically the girl
[17:17:01] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: // Bite me
[17:17:11] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //you are a female character, you bite me
[17:17:14] James McKay: Eh...
[17:17:23] James McKay: Looks like someone was here...
[17:17:25] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Harder isn't the word I like to use.
[17:17:30] Tyrone Adams: Yep.
[17:17:34] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: But it is more selective than other divisions, yes.
[17:17:54] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Just a sidenote, JUDGE units are the ones who will pull housing records and really get into a paper trail or look over past video feed, things like that.
[17:17:55] James McKay: Bet I could cook one of these up...
[17:18:02] Tyrone Adams: That'd be nice.
[17:18:04] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The kind of things you'd see in CSI or in bad dime-store pulp.
[17:18:20] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Intriguing.
[17:18:21] James McKay: Damn!
[17:18:25] James McKay: Nothin'
[17:18:25] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Anything else before we move onto ranks?
[17:18:29] Tyrone Adams: Cleaned out
[17:18:31] James McKay: Could try that cargo ship
[17:18:41] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: fantastic
[17:18:44] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//oh
[17:18:46] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//what's uyp
[17:18:50] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: None.
[17:18:54] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//oh ight
[17:18:57] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Alright, ranks.
[17:19:11] James McKay: I'd just need a heat source...
[17:19:14] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The standard rank progression goes from i5 to Sectorial.
[17:19:22] James McKay: Couldn't taste THAT bad...
[17:19:24] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: You start at i5, and go up to i1. Lower number, higher rank.
[17:19:30] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: These ranks are known as ground units.
[17:19:45] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: They're the ones who you see in the field most of the time.
[17:19:45] James McKay: Damn...
[17:19:50] James McKay: Cleaned out too!
[17:19:52] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: After that comes the field command units.
[17:20:01] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: These ranks are EpU and SqL, Elite Protection Unit and Squad Leader.
[17:20:04] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: In that order.
[17:20:07] James McKay: Who ever was here before us must've found what we're looking for
[17:20:30] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Field command are also found on the ground amongst ground units, hence the name, the difference being one of abilities.
[17:20:30] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Ok
[17:20:31] Tyrone Adams: Nothin'
[17:20:36] James McKay: Damnit...
[17:20:41] Tyrone Adams: Yeah, all gone.
[17:20:45] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: I won't go over the breakdown of what each rank can do, that's too tedious for both of us.
[17:20:52] James McKay: /ooc mfw shell beach is more empty than anything on the map
[17:20:52] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: That information is in your handbook.
[17:21:02] Tyrone Adams: /ooc Fr!
[17:21:04] James McKay: Wonder if the air is clean out here
[17:21:06] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //i17v0 shell beach was cool because it had like
[17:21:08] James McKay: NOPE!
[17:21:09] Tyrone Adams: Guess not.
[17:21:10] Tyrone Adams: Haha.
[17:21:12] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //an actual conscript base. and was huge
[17:21:14] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //and had surface area
[17:21:28] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //and it had actual purpose so you could attack the radio tower and dsirupt raido commnuciations
[17:21:31] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //anyways back to training
[17:21:41] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: After that comes plain old Command.
[17:21:49] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: These ranks are OfC and DvL, officer and divisional.
[17:21:55] James McKay: Shit...
[17:21:57] James McKay: Lets get back...
[17:22:11] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: These ranks are not found in the field. They stay in the nexus most of the time unless they're going from one building to another.
[17:22:42] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: They tend to serve an advisory role, giving orders to units in the field, coordinating actions, watching over the field with cameras, and cooperating more closely with dispatch.
[17:22:57] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The Divisional is the start of the more special rank.
[17:23:08] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: There is only one Divisional per division, as the name implies. They lead the division.
[17:23:14] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: One divisional to one city.
[17:23:33] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: After those ranks comes High Command.
[17:23:42] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: You mean one Commander to one city?
[17:23:48] James McKay: Wonder if anything is in here...
[17:23:49] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: I know what I said.
[17:23:56] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Hm
[17:23:57] James McKay: Damn...Locked
[17:23:58] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: There's one Divisional per Division per City.
[17:24:03] James McKay: Maybe try your pipe...
[17:24:08] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: That makes more sense.
[17:24:13] James McKay: Try break the lock off...
[17:24:22] Tyrone Adams: /looc I need a gm for this right?
[17:24:25] James McKay: /looc Yep
[17:24:27] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Next up is High Command.
[17:24:32] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: These units do not have divisions, they are divisionless.
[17:24:38] Tyrone Adams: /looc What's the command to call an adminge?
[17:24:44] James McKay: /looc @
[17:24:47] James McKay: /looc Probably
[17:24:50] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: And on paper are more members of the overall Universal Union than they are members of the CCA.
[17:24:55] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Consider it a dual membership.
[17:24:58] Tyrone Adams to admins: Need someone to gm breaking a lock for me
[17:25:02] Tyrone Adams: /looc Yep

[17:25:15] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The first of these ranks is Commander.
[17:25:28] Tyrone Adams: /pm Epu Pipe against a fridge lock.
[17:25:35] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: There's one commander per city. They run the city's entire military presence, OTA, synths, and conscripts included.
[17:25:41] James McKay: /rollattribute strength
