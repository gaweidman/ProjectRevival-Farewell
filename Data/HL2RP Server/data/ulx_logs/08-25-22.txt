[22:47:24] Jonathan Jackson: Ah hello there
[22:47:38] Andrew Cloverman: Hi, how can I help you?
[22:48:08] Jonathan Jackson: I'm here about getting supplies and basic furnishings for my business, the Grizzly Grotto.
[22:48:26] Andrew Cloverman: Oh, great, you're talking to the right guy
[22:48:26] Jonathan Jackson: I tried coming earlier, but it doesn't seem someone was available.
[22:48:35] Jonathan Jackson: Hopefully so.
[22:48:44] Andrew Cloverman: My name is Andrew, I'm sure I'll be seeing you more frequently. I'm with the Logistics corps, we handle this sort of requets.
[22:48:56] Andrew Cloverman: We're pretty small given the small CWU presence in the city, but we're necessary.
[22:49:12] Andrew Cloverman: That said, Grizzly Grotto. Let me get some paper and I can get writing an order for you
[22:49:19] Jonathan Jackson: Alright perfect.
[22:49:42] Andrew Cloverman: /chargiveitem andrew notepad
[22:50:05] Andrew Cloverman: alright, so, I know that location is a bar.
[22:50:09] Andrew Cloverman: So you'll need alcohol, clearly.
[22:50:34] Andrew Cloverman: Beer, various hard liquors. Whiskey, vodka, rum, tequila, all that.
[22:51:14] Jonathan Jackson: Yes that is correct, but we also have it oufitted for dining as well, nothing too fancy. Our menu consists mainly of Burgers, Fish, Pizza, and some deserts.
[22:51:27] Andrew Cloverman: Gotcha, simple stuff.
[22:51:46] Andrew Cloverman: Just real quick, what were you thinking about, quote unquote "nicer" forms of alcohol?
[22:51:52] Andrew Cloverman: Specifically wine and absinthe.
[22:51:57] Andrew Cloverman: Either of those speaking to you:
[22:52:00] Andrew Cloverman: .//you?*
[22:52:18] Jonathan Jackson: That would be great considering the location, smaller stuff for those just having dinner is great too.
[22:52:40] Andrew Cloverman: alright..
[22:53:18] Jonathan Jackson: Moving onto the furnishings though....
[22:53:32] Jonathan Jackson: /me looks at a small list compiled on a notepad in his hands.
[22:54:05] Andrew Cloverman: Oh, if you just hand me that list, I can give it ar ead
[22:54:14] Jonathan Jackson: First off we'll need some fridges for storing food, that should be fairly obvious, the metal ones in the back don't seem to work.
[22:54:34] Jonathan Jackson: I don't know if you could read my handwriting.
[22:55:01] Jonathan Jackson: /looc It is in just listed in a discord channel I have
[22:55:24] Andrew Cloverman: .//ah dope
[22:55:46] Jonathan Jackson: But anyways, secondly we'll need maybe two metal cabinets for storing some tools, cutlery etc.
[22:56:13] Jonathan Jackson: /me looks to the wall.
[22:56:41] Jonathan Jackson: We'll also need some of those air filters placed in the building, so that way our customers can take off their masks to eat.
[22:56:42] Andrew Cloverman: /me would write on a notepad with a pencil as he listens to the man.
[22:57:23] Jonathan Jackson: And lastly in terms of furnishings, we just need the password for the lock on the cash register.
[22:58:00] Jonathan Jackson: Besides that all I think we need is a steady supply of regular drinks as well, like water or juice.
[22:58:21] Andrew Cloverman: Juice as in fruit juice?
[22:58:29] Andrew Cloverman: That would also be needed for cocktails and mocktails
[22:58:34] Jonathan Jackson: Yeah.
[22:58:49] Jonathan Jackson: /me scans over the list again.
[22:58:56] Jonathan Jackson: Other than that...
[22:59:02] Jonathan Jackson: I think that's about it.
[22:59:20] Andrew Cloverman: Awesome.. so, burgers I've got, and their ingredients..
[22:59:51] Jonathan Jackson: Mhm, do you want me to give you the full menu?
[23:00:34] Andrew Cloverman: Please, that would be helpful.
[23:02:10] Jonathan Jackson: Sure, Burgers, Grilled Tuna, Grilled Salmon,  BBQ Ribs, Pizza Pie, Pizza Slice, Steak, Apple and Pumpkin Pie, Frosted Doughnuts, and a PB & N Sandwich
[23:02:23] Jonathan Jackson: I'll be honest I don't know what the N is.
[23:02:36] Jonathan Jackson: It's probably just miswritten for Jelly.
[23:03:48] Andrew Cloverman: Alright..
[23:04:00] Andrew Cloverman: Let me get some things written down here give me a second.
[23:04:06] Jonathan Jackson: Of course.
[23:04:07] Andrew Cloverman: /me would quickly make notes on his notepad.
[23:05:57] Andrew Cloverman: Are french fries in mind for you?
[23:06:03] Andrew Cloverman: If you want to do doughnuts, you'll need a deep frier anyways.
[23:06:13] Jonathan Jackson: That would definitely work for us.
[23:06:51] Andrew Cloverman: Alright, one second..
[23:06:58] Jonathan Jackson: Mhm
[23:07:28] Andrew Cloverman: So, for beer, you would likely be using a keg, so you would need CO2 containers.
[23:07:37] Andrew Cloverman: Or if you don't care for that, we could just ship in beer bottles exclusively.
[23:07:40] Andrew Cloverman: Either way works for us
[23:07:58] Jonathan Jackson: Bottles would probably be easier for now.
[23:08:20] Andrew Cloverman: Alright..
[23:09:46] Andrew Cloverman: Alright, have a look at this. Tell me if I'm missing anything.
[23:09:49] Andrew Cloverman: Oh, actually, hold on
[23:10:36] Jonathan Jackson: Alright
[23:11:12] Andrew Cloverman: Alright
[23:11:26] Jonathan Jackson: /me looks over the notepad
[23:11:27] Andrew Cloverman: /me places a notepad on the counter.
[23:11:32] Andrew Cloverman: Have a look at this, tell me if I'm missing anythig
[23:12:01] Andrew Cloverman: Some things I put on there myself because I figured you owuld need them. Hotel pans are needed for any place that makes food, same goes for those chemicals and that cookeware
[23:12:05] Andrew Cloverman: .//hotel pans are those things 
[23:12:13] Andrew Cloverman: .//let me DM you some pictures, idk if you've ever worked in a restaurant
[23:12:42] Jonathan Jackson: That all looks good, kinda forgot I had to mention them.
[23:13:00] Andrew Cloverman: No worries, I figured they were a given.
[23:13:53] Jonathan Jackson: /looc I'm guessing most of the items on the menu aren't actual food things in the server, right?
[23:14:30] Andrew Cloverman: .//not at the moment but adding them in wouldn't be too much of ap ain
[23:14:47] Andrew Cloverman: .//i mean ti would take al ittle time but it wouldn't be terrible
