[23:54:14] OTA.C08-ECHO.OWS.24151: in
[23:54:19] Jay Stelly: /y Alright.
[23:54:47] Jay Stelly: /y Does anybody see anything strange about that thing?
[23:54:55] Jay Stelly: /y I recognize it as one of the controllers!
[23:55:02] Irenka Kaczmarek: Everything is flooting.
[23:55:04] OTA.C08-ECHO.OWS.24151: unit response = unwarranted
[23:55:05] Jay Stelly: /y Or whatever you called them? The flying things?
[23:55:14] CCA.C14-ECHO.OWC.39412: Affirmative
[23:55:15] Jay Stelly: /y With the big heads that shot the orange electricity?
[23:55:19] Jay Stelly: /y 
[23:55:20] Andrew Reeves: He don't will get killed easily, obviously.
[23:55:20] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: Yeah, we know em.
[23:55:28] Andrew Reeves: He...it, whatever
[23:55:31] Jay Stelly: /y It's not far to assume that it could be related to those!
[23:55:50] Jay Stelly: /y And what do those do? I've seen them, I've obseved them!
[23:55:56] Jay Stelly: /y They fight using their mind!
[23:56:03] Jay Stelly: /y So we need something that can fight with it's mind.
[23:56:06] Jay Stelly: .//its.*
[23:56:07] OTA.C08-ECHO.OWS.24151: Echo:One
[23:56:09] CCA.C14-ECHO.OWC.39412: Copy?
[23:56:12] Jay Stelly: /pm dvl this is the advisor idea comes in
[23:56:14] OTA.C08-ECHO.OWS.24151: maintain short-term perimeter
[23:56:15] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: Hm
[23:56:18] Andrew Reeves: /w he also control vortigaunts...
[23:56:19] OTA.C08-ECHO.OWS.24151: within distance
[23:56:24] Jay Stelly: /pm dvl make sure to yell so people hear and listen
[23:56:25] CCA.C14-ECHO.OWC.39412: Copy that, beginning perimeter check
[23:56:37] John Zimmer: What if we go up?
[23:56:42] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: /y I... think I can source something for this. It's a uh... how do you put it...
[23:56:57] CCA.C14-ECHO.OWC.39412: you
[23:56:59] CCA.C14-ECHO.OWC.39412: Back
[23:57:14] Andrew Reeves: there's something down there
[23:57:16] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: /y Synthetic. Expeirmental. Some very, very, very experimental HELIX shit. 
[23:57:26] Irenka Kaczmarek: /me would go to the egde and look up and down.
[23:57:32] Andrew Reeves: DvL, looks like there's something down there
[23:57:34] Irenka Kaczmarek: What do you see?
[23:57:38] CCA.C14-ECHO.OWC.39412: // I really like this so far 
[23:57:39] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: /y We would have to get in contact with the Universial Union to actually... bring one in though.
[23:57:51] Jay Stelly: //it would be better if text chat wasn't utter fucking chaos
[23:57:55] CCA.C14-ECHO.OWC.39412: // True
[23:58:00] Jay Stelly: /y Everybody hear?
[23:58:15] Jay Stelly: /y Helix DvL here says there's an experimental synthetic that can fight using its mind!
[23:58:22] Jay Stelly: /y But we need to get one from the UU!
[23:58:29] Jay Stelly: What if... we were to bring it here.
[23:58:30] Jay Stelly: Ourselves?
[23:58:35] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: How would we do that?
[23:58:42] Jay Stelly: I think I know how.
[23:58:47] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: Alright. Shoot.
[23:58:59] Jay Stelly: Wait, describe these things to me. Just so I know what they look like.
[23:59:39] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: They're... hard to describe. I can't really describe them. Once again, top secret. Might even get amputated for this shit in all honesty.
[23:59:52] CCA.C14-GRID.i4.36307: // im gonna grab something to eat
[23:59:52] Jay Stelly: /y Well at least we'll get amputated saving the Universal Union!
[23:59:55] CCA.C14-GRID.i4.36307: // one sec
