[00:00:04] Jay Stelly: /y So we're going to teleport us in some experimental mind-psychic synthetics from the Universal Union!
[00:00:12] Jay Stelly: /y Here
[00:00:14] Jay Stelly: .//shit
[00:00:18] Jay Stelly: /y Here's how we're gonna do it!
[00:00:24] OTA.C08-ECHO.OWS.24151: /radio Echo:One. Situation degrading.
[00:00:25] Jay Stelly: /y First off, this place, isn't the borderworld.
[00:00:36] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: /y Further more, if we go through with this plan, and any of you catch even the smallest glimpse of it... talk about it, and it'll be amputation. On the spot.
[00:00:37] Jay Stelly: /y This isn't where all the aliens in the black mesa incident came from1Y
[00:00:51] Jay Stelly: /y What HELIX said.
[00:00:57] CCA.C14-ECHO.OWC.39412: /radio Affirmative, currently maintaining short term perimeter.
[00:01:09] Jay Stelly: /y I spent my life in the Borderworld, Xen, for four years and this isn't it.
[00:01:25] Jay Stelly: /y Saving you all the science, Xen, the alien homeworld, is between Earth and other dimensions!
[00:01:38] Jay Stelly: /y This room here is for sending the aliens to Earth.
[00:02:00] Jay Stelly: /y So if we were to interrupt the process mid transmission, who's to say we wouldn't end up just short of Earth, in the borderworld.
[00:02:08] Jay Stelly: /y Why would we do that, another excellent question!
[00:02:22] Jay Stelly: /y There are various pieces of technology in the borderworld!
[00:02:49] Jay Stelly: /y One of them is a focus array, used in various research projects, and possibly in Xen Relay teleportation.
[00:03:00] OTA.C08-ECHO.OWS.24151: // this is going to take longer than an hour and because of that i'm fucked
[00:03:14] Jay Stelly: /y So, with enough doing, we can get a teleport of one of these synthetics.
[00:03:24] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698 to admins: Honestly, I think we should have a part 2 to this. Some people aren't gonna be able to make it
[00:03:24] Jay Stelly: /y From Earth, then the focus array will redirect it here.
[00:03:26] Jay Stelly to admins: fuck
[00:03:31] Irenka Kaczmarek: Do you think you can take of the armor.
[00:03:32] Jay Stelly to admins: FUUUUUUUCK
[00:03:45] Jay Stelly: /y Are we all clear?
[00:03:50] John Zimmer: Yeah
[00:03:50] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: Yup
[00:03:50] Andrew Reeves: it's so big and heavy
[00:03:53] Jay Stelly: /y Great.
[00:04:02] Jay Stelly: /event We might have to cut this early at a stopping point.
[00:04:07] Jay Stelly: /event Because it's getting late
[00:04:11] CCA.C14-ECHO.OWC.39412: // Indeed
[00:04:12] Jay Stelly: /y If that happens, it will be finished tomorrow.
[00:04:13] Andrew Reeves: they have hands in the belly like Vortigaunts.
[00:04:14] Jay Stelly: .//shit
[00:04:19] Irenka Kaczmarek: True. maybe just the helmet.
[00:04:20] OTA.C08-ECHO.OWS.24151: // oh thank the universal union
[00:04:20] Jay Stelly: /event If that happens, it will be finished tomorrow.
[00:04:31] CCA.C14-ECHO.OWC.39412: // BET
[00:04:36] Jay Stelly: /event We're going to go a little longer.
[00:04:51] Jay Stelly: /event Then we're gonna put a pin in it.
[00:04:53] CCA.C14-ECHO.OWC.39412: /radio ECHO, multiple citizens lost.
[00:05:00] Jay Stelly: /y We can initiate the teleport by trying to find some other technology.
[00:05:04] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: Hm
[00:05:12] Jay Stelly: /y If you're confused, don't worry, we'll get ther.e
[00:05:21] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: Fuck it, they're death
[00:05:22] Jay Stelly: /y So until then, let's get to where they send things off!
[00:05:32] Andrew Reeves: hi

[00:05:59] Andrew Reeves: xenian crystals
[00:06:03] OTA.C08-ECHO.OWS.24151: /radio Crystal sighted earlier.

[00:08:12] Jay Stelly: /y Alright. Does anybody have any sort of explosive charge?
[00:08:18] Jay Stelly: Lookingat you two.
[00:08:30] Jay Stelly: Do you have any explosive, possibly one we can detonate on command?
[00:08:30] OTA.C08-ECHO.OWS.24151: Currently possess a fragmentation grenade
[00:08:36] Jay Stelly: That can work.
[00:08:44] CCA.C14-ECHO.OWC.39412: Ugh
[00:08:47] Jay Stelly: I've got some cables on me.
[00:08:57] Jay Stelly: I can rig up the grenade, pull the pin with the string, and then we can go.
[00:09:05] Jay Stelly: Cables, raher.
[00:09:12] Jay Stelly: May I kindly see the fragmentation grenade?
[00:09:17] Irenka Kaczmarek: /pm jay Can I remove the wasp shooter from the dead alien grunt?
[00:09:18] John Zimmer: I have some cables
[00:09:20] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: Give it to him.
[00:09:24] OTA.C08-ECHO.OWS.24151: understood
[00:09:32] Jay Stelly: /pm irenka depends on how you rp it
[00:09:35] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: He has no reason to betray us. Unless he prefers being stuck here.

[00:11:36] Jay Stelly: /y Alright.
[00:11:37] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: Pay cut
[00:11:46] OTA.C08-ECHO.OWS.24151: I don't get paid

[00:12:13] Irenka Kaczmarek: /pm jay /me would look at the arm of the alien grunt, Looking at the difference between both arms, would look at the connector of the alien connected to the other alien. She'd slowly begin to lift the sleeve of the paracite around the aliens arm.
[00:12:15] Jay Stelly: We're missing civillians.
[00:12:24] OTA.C08-ECHO.OWS.24151: one is stuck below

[00:16:52] Jay Stelly: /pm irenka also if it's sharp enough to cut skin why wouldn't it hurt pulling the tooth out
[00:16:58] CCA.C14-ECHO.OWC.39412: Copy, we should move on without him.
