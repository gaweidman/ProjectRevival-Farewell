[22:58:41] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: You are lucky I carry the level of knowledge I do.
[22:58:48] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: .//for the record i'm buffing this for the sake of the event
[22:58:51] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: .//i don't like doing that

[22:59:03] Anastasia Ivanovich: .// you can't do much else
[22:59:28] Brandon Miller: /me is not a shitizen, he is a very fine fellow
[22:59:39] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: /me would proceed to say words in vortigese under his breath, and then radiate green energy from his hands. You would see the woman's veins pulse green for a few moments.
[23:00:06] Anastasia Ivanovich: /me is also a very fine woman... Her vision turned green for a brief moment. She breathed in sharply in reaction to that.
[23:00:29] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: /it The woman's wounds would seem to... close, in a way. The bullets are pushed upwards to the edge of her wounds.
[23:00:40] Brandon Miller: /me does not look
[23:01:00] Anastasia Ivanovich: /me felt as bullets just pushed out of her... Gross.
[23:01:02] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: /me would lift their hands and remove the bullets from the wounds.
[23:01:07] CAC.S71-VRP.50195 set the hp for Anastasia Ivanovich to 100

[23:01:39] Anastasia Ivanovich: Stop that being
[23:01:41] Anastasia Ivanovich: yeah
[23:01:42] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: indeed
[23:01:55] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: The island is on Svalbard. My kin reminded me.
[23:01:58] Anastasia Ivanovich: lead the way
[23:02:05] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: That is an island far north of here.
[23:02:14] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: Far on foot, but by air, not as difficult.
[23:02:35] Anastasia Ivanovich: Well... Guess on foot it is because our dropship is beyond repair.
[23:02:37] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: My kin shall speak to members of resistance. A helicopter is not a large ask.
[23:02:44] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: .//of a resistance cell* fuck
[23:02:45] Anastasia Ivanovich: Ah
[23:02:54] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: for now, you all must prepare yourselves.
[23:03:03] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: We have one more task.
[23:03:06] Anastasia Ivanovich: Go on
[23:03:18] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: we must aid the Combine in the defense of their site.
[23:03:29] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: This sounds insane, but trust me.
[23:03:33] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: Have faith, please.
[23:03:42] Brandon Miller: Aid the Combine?  Good!
[23:03:46] Anastasia Ivanovich: I'd rather them than whatever Desert shit that being wants
[23:03:48] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: I shall explain.
[23:03:53] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: Exactly.
[23:03:59] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: In front of us lay two outcomes.
[23:04:07] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: /me would turn toward Brandon.
[23:04:29] Brandon Miller: which two outcomes are those?
[23:04:54] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: In one of them, the Earth is turned into a wasteland on which nothing can live. Billions die.
[23:05:08] Brandon Miller: Hmmmm...
[23:05:11] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: On the other, billions live.
[23:05:12] Brandon Miller: and the other?
[23:05:14] Brandon Miller: oh 
[23:05:18] Anastasia Ivanovich: I prefer to live
[23:05:21] Anastasia Ivanovich: I'm too young to die
[23:05:24] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: By helping the Combine, we aid the lesser evil.
[23:05:25] Brandon Miller: Lets shoot for the live outcome
[23:05:35] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: We must fight for uncertain death than certain death.
[23:05:45] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: Am I getting through to you?
[23:06:04] Anastasia Ivanovich: /me nodded... She doesn't really give off a rebellious or a loyalist... Vibe?
[23:06:04] Brandon Miller: "Certain slavery, anyway..."  *Brandon mutters*
[23:06:11] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: indeed
[23:06:29] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: That said, we must make contact and hope dearly they do not hurt us.
[23:06:35] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: come with me, we must return to the terminal.
[23:06:54] CAC.S71-VRP.50195: /me would open up the elevator by pressing the up button.
