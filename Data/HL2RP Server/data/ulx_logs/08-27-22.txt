[12:48:08] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //not remotely overcooked
[12:48:09] James McKay: You no look well?
[12:48:12] Jonathan Jackson: I'm fine, just got 20 tokens.
[12:48:16] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //but we've gotta acquiesce because we don't want the review
[12:48:22] James McKay: No no no...You are not well...You look hurt!
[12:48:24] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //the bad review*
[12:48:31] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //so we remake it over the course of 15-20 minutes
[12:48:35] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //which might i add fucks with our chef
[12:48:38] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //because he knew it was right
[12:48:44] Jonathan Jackson: I am relatively fine. I can buy a bandage without worrying about losing money on it
[12:48:54] James McKay: No no no...I insist let me help you! Its my duty!
[12:48:57] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //so he's making food for other tables, doing a shitton at once, all while clearly preoccupied with going crazy about the steak
[12:48:58] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //steaks*
[12:49:05] Jonathan Jackson: Christ...
[12:49:09] Jonathan Jackson: Fine.
[12:49:12] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //at one point he barehands some scorching hot pans
[12:49:16] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //i heard his hand sizzling
[12:49:19] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //it was bad
[12:49:21] James McKay: /me Nods "Alrighty!"
[12:49:26] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //so we remake the filets over the course of 15-20 minutes
[12:49:28] James McKay: /me Begins to inspect the person for injuries
[12:49:45] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //again, one medium, one medium rare, but this time we go 10 degrees less than what they should be
[12:50:00] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //they get them, and again, they're saying the steaks are overcooked
[12:50:10] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //but they shut their damn stupid idiot moron mouths and eat them
[12:50:16] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //like half of them again at least
[12:50:34] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //so we ask them if they want us to box up their food
[12:50:38] Jonathan Jackson: /it He sees the slash of a zombie on his arm.
[12:50:41] James McKay: Hm...Alright...Okay! That easy enough to deal with! You might feel something for but a moment!
[12:50:45] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //they're like "sure, we can feed it to our dog."
[12:50:50] Jonathan Jackson: What...?
[12:50:54] Major-General Sir Issac Brock KB<STEAM_0:0:193599766> changed their name to Paul-Henri Cartier

[12:51:45] James McKay: There! Much better yes!
[12:51:46] Jonathan Jackson: Uhhh
[12:51:56] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: So, the commander, the CmD, leads the military presence of the city. This includes the conscripts and the OTA, as well as the Metropolice.
[12:52:02] Paul-Henri Cartier: /toggleraise
[12:52:06] Paul-Henri Cartier: /toggleraise
[12:52:09] Jonathan Jackson: FUCK
[12:52:10] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The Sectorial, however, leads the sector the city is in and everything in that sector.
[12:52:17] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: So, for example, in Sector 17 we have City 17.
[12:52:18] Paul-Henri Cartier: /toggleraise
[12:52:25] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: We also have Nova Prospekt in Sector 17.
[12:52:25] James McKay: /y Hah! just like old times!
[12:52:41] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The Sectorial has military control over City 17, Nova Prospekt, and the outlands between them.
[12:52:43] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Make sense?
[12:53:10] Paul-Henri Cartier: /toggleraise
[12:53:19] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Pretty much. Sectorial controls Sector 17, Commander controls military presence in the City 17.
[12:53:19] Paul-Henri Cartier: /toggleraise
[12:53:24] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Exactly.
[12:53:33] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//i'm not an awesome teacher so i'm sorry if i come across condescending
[12:53:41] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//i don't think you're stupid, i'm jsut not experienced with teaching
[12:53:55] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: .// At this point you could straight up bully me I just wanna be trained lol
[12:54:04] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//understandable, let's keep moving
[12:54:14] James McKay: /w Shh...Remain quiet!
[12:54:14] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Then outside of the standard rank progression is the Quartermaster.
[12:54:20] James McKay: /w Move over!
[12:54:23] Jonathan Jackson: /w I fucking told you the CPs would find us.
[12:54:25] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: They are the ammo chiefs of the CCA, if you're familiar with that title.
[12:54:38] James McKay: /w Of course they do, they always do!
[12:54:53] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: They organize the armory, hand out things from the armory, manage living quarters, and assign resources to different military operations.
[12:54:55] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: I've met one in here.
[12:55:01] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: 98240, I imagine?
[12:55:07] James McKay: Why would a CP be down here?
[12:55:11] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: I can't really recall that was a few days ago.
[12:55:13] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: As far as you're concerned at your rank, they're the people you get your equipment from.
[12:55:17] James McKay: That can't be right...
[12:55:22] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Understood.
[12:55:23] Jonathan Jackson: I told you they would do patrols
[12:55:24] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: That's their *main* job to outsiders.
[12:55:27] James McKay: Not down there!
[12:55:28] Jessica Roberts: /pm 774 ayy
[12:55:37] Jonathan Jackson: Clearly they do.
[12:55:42] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Alright, sociostatus.
[12:55:43] James McKay: Seems so...
[12:55:52] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: /pm jess What's up
[12:55:53] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Sociostatus is a measure of how the citizen populus is behaving in general.
[12:55:58] James McKay: Was that a revolver he was using?
[12:56:01] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Some recruits misunderstand sociostatus.
[12:56:05] Jonathan Jackson: It sounded like it
[12:56:05] Jessica Roberts: /pm rct Im about to head, may I add you very quickly on steam to chat?
[12:56:09] James McKay: When did CPs use those?
[12:56:12] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: So, let's say the city is calm, maybe a few violations for running, maybe a barfight, but overall calm,.
[12:56:19] Jonathan Jackson: Don't tell me but that was clearly a metrocop
[12:56:22] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: /pm jess I don't know you but sure

[12:56:36] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Then, out of nowhere, an SqL is murdered. Sociostatus would still be green, because the rest of the citizen populus is behaving fine.
[12:56:38] James McKay: Well we cannot just wait here...

[12:57:44] James McKay: No he did not...He shot at those antlions, He had more than a clear shot to shoot at us...
[12:57:54] James McKay: We were standing completely still...
[12:57:55] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: There's coming back from red, and a red sociostatus can still come back under control.
[12:58:07] James McKay: Hey...You need to survive...I've lived my life for...too long...
[12:58:08] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Black sociostatus is the end of the city scenario.
[12:58:21] James McKay: I'll....I'll go distract him...
[12:58:22] Jonathan Jackson: Don't you dare even try that
[12:58:24] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The Combine presence has been uprooted and citizens, or rather anti-citizens, are in control.
[12:58:27] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Like.. zone fully lost?
[12:58:27] James McKay: Its my duty...
[12:58:29] Jonathan Jackson: Just sit and wait
[12:58:30] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Exactly.
[12:58:34] James McKay: He's sitting! and waiting!
[12:58:36] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Would we retreat?
[12:58:42] James McKay: He'll find us soon...
[12:58:45] Jonathan Jackson: Clearly to shoot us, we can outlast him though
[12:58:45] James McKay: YOU need to run...
[12:58:53] James McKay: No...We can't...
[12:59:00] James McKay: I've seen CPs...
[12:59:04] James McKay: They don't let off easily...
[12:59:07] James McKay: You need to escape
[12:59:12] James McKay: You'll blend in...I can't
[12:59:17] James McKay: You need to survive
[12:59:27] Paul-Henri Cartier: /y I can see you over there.
[12:59:30] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: We've never seen sociostatus black, but as far as I've read in contingency plans, the remaining CCA presence would likely be transferred to another area and OTA and conscripts would walk the streets.
[12:59:32] James McKay: Now go...I'll go across the bridge...
[12:59:37] Jonathan Jackson: Alright..
[12:59:47] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Yikes.
[12:59:58] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: It won't happen, we just have the designation so we're prepared.
[13:00:01] James McKay: Yo-
[13:00:04] James McKay: You ain't a CP...
[13:00:10] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: I like to say "It won't, but what if?"
[13:00:11] Paul-Henri Cartier: It's not safe out here.
[13:00:16] James McKay: No shit! 
[13:00:18] James McKay: /me Chuckles
[13:00:23] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: It's a great way to be prepared, and using that principle is very helpful as a ground unit.
[13:00:24] James McKay: You had us scared to shit! Haha!
[13:00:25] Paul-Henri Cartier: And your hiding skills could use some work
[13:00:36] Paul-Henri Cartier: I-- have a tendency do to that to people 
[13:00:46] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: re-educating someone for talking back likely won't go sour, but what if it does? Make sure you're prepared.
[13:01:03] James McKay: /me Chuckles "Well, you really did to both of us! Hahaha! I'll tell the other to come on out"
[13:01:11] Paul-Henri Cartier: Name's Paul-Henri.
[13:01:12] James McKay: If he hasn't run off yet!
[13:01:24] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Be polite, be professional, and have a plan to kill everyone you meet.
[13:01:26] James McKay: Name is...Well...People just call me "The Doctor"
[13:01:34] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Make sure you always know the first step you would take in any situation if it were to go south.
[13:01:40] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: You get better at that the longer you're in the force.
[13:01:42] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: I'm getting sidetracked.
[13:01:48] Jonathan Jackson: Oh my god oh my god
[13:02:05] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Let's talk about sentencing.
[13:02:06] Paul-Henri Cartier: /me would extend a hand, his glove would have some ripped seams, and it definetely looks like it's been patched up in quite a few areas.
[13:02:10] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: There are three main punishments.
[13:02:16] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Re-education, detaining, and amputation.
[13:02:23] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: We'll talk about re-education last.
[13:02:32] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Detaining is simple. Somebody does a crime, you put them in a jail cell in the nexus
[13:02:45] James McKay: /me Would extend his own hand, shaking the Paul-Henri's hand "Now, I suggest we don't stay out here long yes? Haha! Don't want more bugs coming after us!"
[13:02:56] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: In your handbook there's a list of different violations, all with a severity number
[13:02:56] James McKay: Lemme go call the other over
[13:02:57] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Goes 1-7.
[13:03:05] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The punishment you give will depend on that number.
[13:03:19] Jonathan Jackson: Fuck fuckkk
[13:03:22] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: What're the different assigned numbers?
[13:03:33] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Like I said, they go 1 through 7.
[13:03:41] James McKay: Well...
[13:03:41] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: 1 is a small little crime, 7 is a capital violation.
[13:03:44] James McKay: He's gone...
[13:03:46] James McKay: Wow...
[13:03:46] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: That is, something punished by death.
[13:03:47] Paul-Henri Cartier: .// i think he switched chars
[13:03:51] James McKay: /looc Oh lol
[13:03:55] Paul-Henri Cartier: .// who was it
[13:04:09] James McKay: /looc Painevan?
[13:04:11] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: This is something we've been meaning to tell new recruits, especially.
[13:04:14] James McKay: /looc I think...
[13:04:16] Paul-Henri Cartier: .// character name, i mean
[13:04:16] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Level 1 violations don't always need to be punished.
[13:04:33] James McKay: /looc Idk, dont have em f3'ed
[13:04:39] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: They're there so us cops have a valid reason to tell people off or re-educate them.
[13:04:40] Paul-Henri Cartier: .// oh, it was pain
[13:04:43] Paul-Henri Cartier: .// sad
[13:04:47] Paul-Henri Cartier: .// he didnt switch
[13:04:51] Paul-Henri Cartier: Lost your pal?
[13:04:52] James McKay: /looc Oh alrighty
[13:04:57] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: So, level 1 violations are things like loitering, running, yelling, causing a ruckus.
[13:05:00] James McKay: Nope, He listened and ran! Hah! 
[13:05:08] Paul-Henri Cartier: good.
[13:05:08] Jonathan Jackson: /me exhales.
[13:05:10] James McKay: I was just gonna hand myself in to save his ass!
[13:05:13] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: If somebody is loitering, you don't have to stop them. If they look suspicious, then intervene.
[13:05:14] Jonathan Jackson: Oh my godd...
[13:05:15] James McKay: Well...
[13:05:17] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Am I making sense?>
[13:05:21] James McKay: At least he can run well! Hah!
[13:05:26] Paul-Henri Cartier: look, take it from me, I know. Don't turn yourself in.
[13:05:37] Paul-Henri Cartier: It's usually better to be eaten by an antlion.
[13:05:44] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: So like hanging around back alleys, or near off-limit zones?
[13:05:48] James McKay: I know...I never wanted to...But...I am long overdue, I wanted to make sure atleast...someone lived...
[13:05:59] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Sort of.
[13:06:04] James McKay: Now...Lets get out of this shithole ey?
[13:06:09] Paul-Henri Cartier: mhm
[13:06:13] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: So, let's say you see a citizen standing with his hands in his pockets, loitering in front of an apartment building.
[13:06:15] James McKay: /looc pinggggg
[13:06:25] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: He's more or less minding his own business, he looks relaxed, looks pretty innocent.,
[13:06:30] Paul-Henri Cartier: .// gotta check something
[13:06:39] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: You wouldn't prosecute him for loitering.
[13:07:10] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Now, if you saw somebody standing at a corner, holding a strange briefcase, looking over his shoulders in a shifty way, you would want to intervene.
[13:07:23] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Makes sense to me.
[13:07:26] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Great.
[13:07:32] Paul-Henri Cartier: .// guh
[13:07:35] James McKay: /looc guh
[13:07:42] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: So, level 1 violations. You don't need to prosecute for them if no harm is being done.
[13:07:44] Paul-Henri Cartier: i knovv a place
[13:07:47] James McKay: Oh?
[13:07:56] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Those are just punished with re-education. In layman's terms, a beating.
[13:08:16] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: As you're aware, crimes and loyal acts are tracked with the loyalist point system.
[13:08:26] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: You commit a crime, you lose LP, you clean garbage, you gain LP.
[13:08:37] Client "Apex" connected.
[13:08:47] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: LP isn't lost for level 1 violations, nor do level 1 violations go into a citizen's data file.
[13:09:03] James McKay: /me Adjusts his vest, tightening a strap on it
[13:09:07] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: However, level 2-7 violations do take away some LP. The amount lost depends on the level of the crime, which you can find in your handbook.,
[13:09:16] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: I won't go over those numbers, you do that on your own time or on the fly.
[13:09:20] James McKay: Not much doctors around I hear...
[13:09:24] Paul-Henri Cartier: keep a secret?
[13:09:29] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Ok
[13:09:30] James McKay: Me? always!
[13:09:32] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: To this day I'll still have the handbook up on one side of my screen and the data file on the other side of my screen.
[13:09:39] Paul-Henri Cartier: /me would kick the wall
[13:09:40] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Alright, then amputation.
[13:09:44] James McKay: Woah...
[13:09:47] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: That's fairly simple, you're executed.
[13:09:48] James McKay: Magic!
[13:09:55] Paul-Henri Cartier: mhm
[13:09:56] James McKay: Wow...Quite cozy!
[13:09:58] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: For level 5 and 6 crimes, you get a trial for amputation.
[13:10:02] Paul-Henri Cartier: yup
[13:10:06] James McKay: Compared to last place I live....Hah!
[13:10:09] Paul-Henri Cartier: we tend to keep out of the way down here
[13:10:12] Jonathan Jackson: // That was intense
[13:10:14] Paul-Henri Cartier: fresh air, food...
[13:10:21] James McKay: And now a Doctor!
[13:10:24] Paul-Henri Cartier: mhm
[13:10:26] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: This is when you're sat down with a JUDGE unit and he decides whether or not you should be put to death.
[13:10:32] Paul-Henri Cartier: well, we have some vortigaunts who stop by
[13:10:34] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: This is based on your intent, your past history, things like that.
[13:10:39] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Your willingness to be reformed, you get it.
[13:10:45] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Yep
[13:10:45] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Then, lastly, re-education.
[13:10:46] James McKay: Ah! The Vortiguants! I've yet to see one around much! 
[13:10:54] James McKay: They are always interesting to listen to!
[13:10:56] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: There are 4 severities.
[13:11:01] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Minor, moderate, high, and on the spot.
[13:11:04] James McKay: Or...I'm just really lonely...
[13:11:14] James McKay: Both very possible...
[13:11:14] Paul-Henri Cartier: they are, kind of give me the creeps, though.
[13:11:22] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Minor, moderate, and high have their own stunstick voltage and number of strikes, you can find those numbers in the handbook, I won't go over them with you.
[13:11:24] Paul-Henri Cartier: and listen, don't tell anyone about this place
[13:11:34] James McKay: The secret is safe with me!
[13:11:37] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: On the spot re-education is done on low. You don't even get the citizen on the wall, you just hit them.
[13:11:39] James McKay: I assure you...
[13:11:40] Paul-Henri Cartier: not even your closest friends. The UU has eyes everywhere.
[13:11:44] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//on the spot re-education is what the cops in HL2 do
[13:11:52] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Any other kind of re-education, you get them on the wall first.
[13:11:53] James McKay: I not have much friends...Lost them when I came here...
[13:11:57] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: any questions?
[13:12:00] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Nope
[13:12:06] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Alright, let's break the boringness.
[13:12:12] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Get out your stunstick, here's a demo on how to use it.
[13:12:14] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /toggleraise
[13:12:26] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//oh nice you already know
[13:12:27] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//sweet
[13:12:28] James McKay: /me Shrugs "But I meet new people here now! I no plan on getting relocated again!"
[13:12:30] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//yeah so that's how you turn it on
[13:12:35] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//if you hit them.. i think it's 3 or 4 times
[13:12:38] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//while the stunstick is on
[13:12:40] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//they pass out
[13:12:45] Paul-Henri Cartier: riight\
[13:12:53] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//hit r to change your voltage. it also makes a funny noise
[13:12:54] Paul-Henri Cartier: wait here
[13:12:59] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: .// do I reeducate with it off or on
[13:13:03] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//always on
[13:13:05] James McKay: /me Nods "Will do!"
[13:13:16] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//short aside, i have my MOUSE4 key to the /toggleraise command
[13:13:20] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//it's a nice little shorthand
[13:13:27] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//i recommend doing that if you have those side mouse keys
[13:13:32] James McKay: /me Inspects the area around him
[13:13:44] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Alright, that's punishment
[13:13:56] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Next up, searching people.
[13:14:00] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: This is simple.
[13:14:08] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: You get them on the wall. If they don't get on the wall, hit them until they do.

[13:14:26] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//and then you don't need to zip tie someone to search them

[13:15:04] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Alright, just some simple stuff before we get into combat.
[13:15:06] Paul-Henri Cartier: /chargiveitem paul priority
[13:15:14] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: There's 3 main procedures you need to know baout.
[13:15:17] Paul-Henri Cartier: /chargiveitem paul "priority ration" 3
[13:15:20] James McKay: /me Would unsheath his combat knife, inspecting it "My my...Have you gone through something...You need a good cleaning!"
[13:15:20] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Judgement waiver, unrest structure, and unrest procedure.
[13:15:50] James McKay: /me Would sheath his combat knife again, before leaning up against the wall behind him
[13:16:02] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Judgement waiver is called few and far between, it's called whenever things are out of control and CPs shouldn't be expected to do the formalities of their job.
[13:16:25] Client "Apex" spawned in server <STEAM_0:0:170921441> (took 468 seconds).
[13:16:29] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: A judgement waiver is when metropolice in the area get to choose the punishment for crimes at their own will.
[13:16:35] Paul-Henri Cartier: /chargiveitem paul "sparkling water" 3
[13:16:40] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Somebody running? You're free to shoot them dead, that's your choice.
[13:16:42] Paul-Henri Cartier: /chargiveitem paul "water" 3
[13:16:49] Jonathan Jackson: // nice
[13:16:50] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Normally, this is in conjunction with citizens being forced into the apartments.
[13:16:57] Paul-Henri Cartier: /chargiveitem paul "sparkling consulate water" 3
[13:17:14] Paul-Henri Cartier: /chargiveitem paul "priority ration" 3
[13:17:18] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Unrest procedure is called much more frequently than judgement waiver.s
[13:17:22] Paul-Henri Cartier: /chargiveitem paul "priority grade ration" 3
[13:17:45] Paul-Henri Cartier: /chargiveitem paul "standard grade ration" 3
[13:17:53] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Simply, it's when there's a problem, normally a Xenobe or an Anti-Civil threat, and one squad isn't enough to take it down.
[13:17:54] Jonathan Jackson<STEAM_0:0:68118061> changed their name to Zombie
[13:17:58] Paul-Henri Cartier: /chargiveitem paul "standard grade ration" 3
[13:18:14] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: When it's called, several squads assemble to handle the threat together. 
[13:18:21] Paul-Henri Cartier: /chargiveitem paul "flavored consulate water" 3
[13:18:23] Zombie<STEAM_0:0:68118061> changed their name to CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874
[13:18:24] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Unrest STRUCTURE is called after some combine operation is done.
[13:18:33] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: It's called when a combine operation fails.
[13:18:34] Paul-Henri Cartier: /chargiveitem paul "water" 3
[13:18:53] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: So, if a riot is going on, but the units trying to disperse it are unsuccessful, unrest structure is called.
[13:19:07] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: It's basically a reshuffle, a way to tell units to regroup and find a new way to handle whatever the problem is.
[13:19:09] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Making sense?
[13:19:19] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Yes.
[13:19:26] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Fantastic.
[13:19:33] James McKay: /me Looks at the ration "For me?"
[13:19:33] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /r Helix.
[13:19:35] Paul-Henri Cartier: eat, if you want. We have fresh air in here, the mask isn't needed
[13:19:39] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: /radio Copy.
[13:19:40] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /r Report to the armory, Code 2.
[13:19:45] James McKay: /me Nods "Ah thank you very much!"
[13:19:47] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /r We're doing breaching training.
[13:19:50] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: /radio 10-4.
[13:19:55] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: While he's on his way, I'm just gonna cover some quick combat tips.
[13:20:00] James McKay: /me Would remove his mask, rubbing his jaw 
[13:20:05] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: If you're using an automatic weapon, shoot in short bursts.
[13:20:10] Paul-Henri Cartier: /me would enter a code into a locker, opening it up, revealing an SMG and a pistol, shoving a grenade inside.
[13:20:12] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: It helps your accuracy.
[13:20:15] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Second, always find cover.
[13:20:17] James McKay: The name is James...James C. McKay...
[13:20:20] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: You're not Rambo, you're not a Jedi.
[13:20:27] Paul-Henri Cartier: Nice to meet you, James.
[13:20:28] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: You can't just stand out in the open in a gunfight, you will die.
[13:20:41] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Duck behind it until you're ready to shoot, or hide behind it, whatever the situation may be.
[13:20:50] Paul-Henri Cartier: /me would pull his mask off, tossing it haphazardly on the table
[13:20:52] James McKay: You said yours was...ehh...Paul-Henri?
[13:21:01] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: holster the gun
[13:21:08] Paul-Henri Cartier: Paul-Henri Cartier, you can call me Henri
[13:21:08] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Copy.
[13:21:10] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: we're not in code SWORD.
[13:21:12] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Oh, small note
[13:21:19] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: A common code you'll hear is code SWORD.
[13:21:21] James McKay: Nice to meet...you as...ehh...aswell!
[13:21:32] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: When SWORD is active, you keep your firearm out
[13:21:38] Paul-Henri Cartier: mhm
[13:21:41] James McKay: /me Would open the can of water, chugging it back quickly
[13:21:45] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: In regular operation, you either keep your stunstick in your hand or you keep nothing in your hand.
[13:21:50] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Alright, breaching.
[13:21:55] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Mhm.
[13:22:03] Paul-Henri Cartier: /toggleraise
[13:22:08] James McKay: /me Would open his suitcase, looking inside of it
[13:22:19] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Breaching is done when you know there's a significant danger behind a door.
[13:22:23] James McKay: Sheesh...I have a bunch of parts I was carrying around...Guess thats why It was so heavy...
[13:22:27] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: You don't breach every time you come to a closed door.
[13:22:39] James McKay: May I put em on the table?
[13:22:40] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Mhm.
[13:22:43] Paul-Henri Cartier: sure
[13:22:49] Paul-Henri Cartier: there should be a parts locker somewhere
[13:22:54] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Alright, so in breaching, you have linemen and the breacher.
[13:22:56] Paul-Henri Cartier: ah, right here
[13:23:00] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The breacher tends to be the highest ranking unit.
[13:23:02] James McKay: /me Would open the locker
[13:23:07] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The breacher stands OPPOSITE the door handle.
[13:23:17] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: So if I were the breacher, I would stand on this side of the door.
[13:23:25] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: And then the linemen line up closest to the door handle, back to back.
[13:23:33] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: In breaching, there are four code words.
[13:23:37] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Stack, prep, lock, inject.
[13:23:42] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: When stack is called, you line up.
[13:23:47] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: When prep is called, you ready your weapon.
[13:23:52] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: When lock is called, the door is shot open.
[13:23:56] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Inject, you file in.
[13:24:01] James McKay: /me Would shut the locker
[13:24:03] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: When filing in, the linemen go in first. All of them.
[13:24:04] James McKay: Many thanks!
[13:24:07] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Then once the linemen are in, the breacher goes in.
[13:24:19] James McKay: Bye the way, You want this ziptie? I have no use for it...But I carry around incase people want it...
[13:24:28] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: When filing in, you want to scan for threats.
[13:24:29] Paul-Henri Cartier: sure, hand it to me
[13:24:41] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Look in corners, make sure the room is clear.
[13:24:44] James McKay: /me Would reach into his backpack, taking out a ziptie, handing it over to Paul
[13:24:48] James McKay: /looc Henri****
[13:24:50] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: alright, let's get practicing. Recruit, you're breaching.

[13:25:06] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Shall I use my real sidearm?
[13:25:11] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Yes.
[13:25:15] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: you'll be calling out the code words.
[13:25:16] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Preferably.
[13:25:17] Paul-Henri Cartier: oh, one second
[13:25:20] James McKay: /me Would reach into his bag, taking out a old ICT Uniform "Not much use for this now"
[13:25:22] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Okay.
[13:25:23] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: so, when you're ready
[13:25:26] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Stack
[13:25:30] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /toggleraise

[13:25:34] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Lock
[13:25:36] Paul-Henri Cartier: this--
[13:25:37] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: Inject
[13:25:42] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Right clear
[13:25:47] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: well done.
[13:25:49] Paul-Henri Cartier: is for your friend, as an apology for scaring them
[13:25:58] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: When filing in, HELIX did a very good thing, which was breaking up into left and right.
[13:26:01] James McKay: Ah...When I see him next...I will give it to him...
[13:26:02] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: /me holsters her sidearm and clips it shut.
[13:26:11] James McKay: Though...I don't know much of where he is now...
[13:26:13] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /me would lower his pistol and snap it back into his holster as he speaks.
[13:26:21] James McKay: /me Would put the ration and water into his backpack
[13:26:28] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: If you're in front, you look to your right. If you're not in front, you look to your left.
[13:26:32] Paul-Henri Cartier: hopefully he made it back into the city
[13:26:32] James McKay: I'm sure I'll find him eventually...
[13:26:37] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Much more efficient way of sweeping a room.
[13:26:44] James McKay: Hopefully...
[13:26:46] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Alright, one more time. I'll be breaching, recruit, you're in front.

[13:27:05] Paul-Henri Cartier: We have a path directly into the city, if you want in
[13:27:06] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Nice one.
[13:27:10] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: INJECT

[13:27:28] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: alright, that's all of it.
[13:27:29] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: /me holsters his sidearm and clips it in.
[13:27:29] Paul-Henri Cartier: /chareditbodygroup paul

[13:27:47] CCA.C17-RCT.77460: /me holsters her sidearm and clips it shut.
[13:27:52] Paul-Henri Cartier: well, it's still good to know
[13:27:56] James McKay: People are lookin' for that exact suit...Guess I stole it and they found out...
[13:27:58] Paul-Henri Cartier: we have a spare suit somewhere
[13:28:00] James McKay: Yeah...Indeed it is...
[13:28:01] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Helix, you're dismissed.

[14:01:27] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Every division patrols and charges people for crimes, but 3 of the 4 divisions have secondary jobs to do when not patrolling or dealing with standard duties.
[14:01:35] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The first is UNION, it is the standard bread and butter division.

[14:02:59] Paul-Henri Cartier froze Jonathan Jackson
[14:03:06] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: So a GRID unit gets a manhack at EpU, but a UNION unit gets a manhack at i1. Similar thing for flashbangs, smoke grenades, and riot shields.
[14:03:12] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: We appreciate your loyalty. Please come back in a bit when there may be more work to do.
[14:03:14] Jonathan Jackson: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
[14:03:15] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: GRID units are the mechanics, repairmen, and engineers of the CCA.

[14:03:52] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: You need people to maintain the APC, you need people to install mini-generators, you need people to genecode pulse weapons.

[14:09:06] James McKay: /ooc Nope
[14:09:17] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Their job is, in general, investigating crimes more complex than a simple robbery.

[14:10:00] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: This could be investigating an anti-citizen cell, it could be just finding out why someone keeps finding contraband on the regular.

[14:10:09] James McKay: Close enough...Fooled me
[14:10:10] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: If something is unknown, they fix that.

[14:11:00] Paul-Henri Cartier: You hear that?
[14:11:02] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Exactly.

[14:11:10] CCA.C17-RCT.00344: I remember back in another city.

[14:11:18] CCA.C17-RCT.00344: Understood.
[14:11:21] James McKay: Ye-Yeah...The grizzly...That means someone is open
[14:11:25] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: They are expected to have more of an intimidating air about them, but that's to give them more power.
[14:11:33] Paul-Henri Cartier: .// im stuck in a sprint
[14:11:35] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: A lot of the CCA is looking powerful.

[14:11:39] James McKay: /looc lmao*
[14:11:51] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: But if the anti-citizens don't believe that, they'll try to walk all over us.
[14:11:55] Paul-Henri Cartier: hmm
[14:12:00] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Same goes for regular everyday citizens.
[14:12:03] Jonathan Jackson: // This music is jamming though.
[14:12:08] James McKay: That...may become a problem now...eh?
[14:12:14] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: To enforce something as strong as the Combine, you need to seem like you can do the enforcement.
[14:12:15] James McKay: Could find out bout this...
[14:12:19] CCA.C17-RCT.00344: /me Chuckles softly after undering the regular part of his sentence, the man trying to hold back his laughter.

[14:12:39] Paul-Henri Cartier: we'll limit use of that exit
[14:12:42] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: It's a delicate balance to walk, being intimidating, but not being a complete dick.
[14:12:50] James McKay: Well...We'll have to now...
[14:13:00] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Never tell a citizen to fuck off, but give the impression that you might.
[14:13:10] James McKay: Hm...
[14:13:13] CCA.C17-RCT.00344: So basically.
[14:13:13] Paul-Henri Cartier: maybe you could check it out
[14:13:17] CCA.C17-RCT.00344: Be professional.
[14:13:18] James McKay: Me?
[14:13:25] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Exactly, but be short with citizens.
[14:13:27] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: you're not their friend
[14:13:31] James McKay: I-Well...What if they start questioning me!
[14:13:32] CCA.C17-RCT.00344: They never were.
[14:13:40] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Don't be a dick, just make sure you're not their friend.
[14:13:41] James McKay: Unless I go through the CZ...
[14:13:47] James McKay: But I heard CP patrols nearby...
[14:13:51] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Many people think you can't show emotion in the CCA. You very much can.
[14:13:58] James McKay: And If I go through the bathroom...Gonna be a bit strange...
[14:13:58] Paul-Henri Cartier: stay here
[14:14:11] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: But you should try to be stoic whenever possible.

[14:14:47] Paul-Henri Cartier: come

[14:14:50] James McKay: Oh you're back
[14:14:54] Paul-Henri Cartier: come
[14:14:58] Paul-Henri Cartier: suit on
[14:15:04] CCA.C17-RCT.00344: What rank is considered a 'high rank'?
[14:15:12] Paul-Henri Cartier: .// pp[

[14:15:19] CCA.C17-RCT.00344: Fantastic.

[14:15:25] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Field command and up.
[14:15:27] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Maybe an i1.
[14:15:39] James McKay: /looc alr
[14:15:41] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: An i1 can probably flag down someone higher ranking, someone qualified to let you into HELIX.
[14:15:42] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: so, ranks.
[14:15:46] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: There are 4 main rank groupings.
[14:15:51] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Ground units, field command, command, and high command.
[14:15:54] Paul-Henri Cartier: had this hidden
[14:15:55] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: Hello
[14:15:55] Jonathan Jackson: Ah hello there!
[14:16:00] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Ground unit ranks go from i5 to i1, with i5 being the lowest and i1 being the highest.
[14:16:04] Paul-Henri Cartier brought James McKay
[14:16:06] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: I assume you sell alcohol here?
[14:16:09] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Ground units are the ones in the field doing standard work.
[14:16:15] Jonathan Jackson: We do sell alcohol yes!
[14:16:18] CCA.C17-RCT.00344: /pm 460 How long did your training take.
[14:16:18] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: UU Approved?
[14:16:21] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: After i1 comes field command, EpU and Sql, in that order.
[14:16:30] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: /pm 344 A bit but he's a good trainer
[14:16:32] Paul-Henri Cartier: Good luck
[14:16:35] Jonathan Jackson: Mhm, and some house made as well. All within CWU limits of course.
[14:16:37] Paul-Henri Cartier: Come back via sewer enterance
[14:16:55] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Field command units also go out and about, patrolling and whatnot, they just have many more privileges of jurisidiction than a standard ground unit.
[14:16:55] Jonathan Jackson: Could I intrest you in some?
[14:17:07] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: Sure why not.
[14:17:11] James McKay: I guess...I'm going alone...
[14:17:16] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: /me clips her stunstick to her side.
[14:17:16] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Alright, after that comes command units.
[14:17:19] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: OfC and DvL.
[14:17:22] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: These units rarely leave the nexus.
[14:17:23] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: Empty
[14:17:34] James McKay: /chardesc
[14:17:42] Jonathan Jackson: Just opened right now really, just got the supplies. Do you want a table?
[14:18:00] James McKay: Huh...This place looks nice!
[14:18:00] Jonathan Jackson: Good day sir! Just one second.
[14:18:01] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Their work is done over the radio and over cameras, advising and giving orders, coordinating the units actually outside of the nexus.
[14:18:07] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: No, I will not reveal myself to the public for drink. Just looking for a bottle for the road.
[14:18:15] Jonathan Jackson: Sure thing!
[14:18:19] Jonathan Jackson: One second if you don't mind.
[14:18:23] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: For GRID and HELIX, OfCs and DvLs mostly do their own division work, JUDGE units, eh. Depends on the unit, really.
[14:18:24] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: Of course
[14:18:29] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: Hey
[14:18:33] James McKay: Yes officer?
[14:18:36] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: Staying out of trouble?
[14:18:40] James McKay: Always! 
[14:18:43] James McKay: /me Chuckles
[14:18:45] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: Good to hear.
[14:18:46] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: But still, that's the expectation. Being a coordinator, listening to radio transmissions and giving out orders when needed.
[14:18:55] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: DvL is where special ranks kick in.
[14:18:57] James McKay: /me Inspects the place
[14:19:03] James McKay: Glad they opened this place up again!
[14:19:07] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: There's one DvL, that is, Divisional, per division per city.
[14:19:14] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: Very classy joint you have.
[14:19:20] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Make sense?
[14:19:25] CCA.C17-RCT.00344: Yep.
[14:19:26] Jonathan Jackson: Thanks, I have two options for you.
[14:19:27] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Weird sentence structure, but it's the simplest way to put it.
[14:19:27] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: A fine statement to the Unions finest workers.
[14:19:28] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Fantastic.
[14:19:36] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: Indulge me.
[14:19:43] CCA.C17-RCT.00344: I assume that there's only one OfC per division, per city, correct?
[14:20:02] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Not the case, there can be multiple OfCs to a division in a single city.
[14:20:05] Jonathan Jackson: I have Gin or Absinthe, as well as beer if you want.
[14:20:08] CCA.C17-RCT.00344: Odd.
[14:20:17] Jonathan Jackson: Absinthe is house made.
[14:20:23] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: Absinthe please.
[14:20:28] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Not many, but there are.
[14:20:33] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: After those ranks comes High Command.
[14:20:33] Jonathan Jackson: Sure thing! Let me get some ready.
[14:20:40] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: These units have a kind of dual membership.
[14:20:53] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: They're members of the CCA, but they're also members of the overall Combine.
[14:21:04] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The quote unquote, "Pure" Combine, outside of the Earth forces.
[14:21:12] Jonathan Jackson: /me starts preparing the cocktail, having already a stockpile set of bottled and ready.
[14:21:16] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Those ranks are Commander and Sectorial.
[14:21:31] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: There's one Commander per City, and one Sectorial per Sector. They lead the military aspects of their zones.
[14:21:33] Jonathan Jackson: /me grabs the drink, holding it in hand.
[14:21:47] Jonathan Jackson: Here you go, 8 tokens for it.
[14:21:53] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: While they can give advisement on political happenings, handling bureaucracy isn't their job.
[14:21:56] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: That's what the ministry is for.
[14:22:11] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: And they tend not to be interested in it, anyways, so conflicts there rarely arise.
[14:22:11] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: /me would take the bottle. In her other hand she'd place some tokens on the table.
[14:22:17] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: /droptokens 10
[14:22:19] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: Glory
[14:22:25] Jonathan Jackson: Thank you very much!
[14:22:30] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: High command units don't just control the CCA, they also control the conscripts and OTA, able to give them orders however they see fit.
[14:22:30] James McKay: /me Would look at the menu
[14:22:41] Jonathan Jackson: Keep in mind we have some specials, would you like a table?
[14:22:54] James McKay: Ehh...Sorry no, I'm a bit busy at the moment...
[14:22:55] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: /me unclips her stun baton.
[14:23:01] James McKay: Just a quick bite to eat...
[14:23:04] Jonathan Jackson: /me opens the cash register, pouring some tokens in before closing it.
[14:23:15] Jonathan Jackson: Of course, we also have standard UU brand food if you want.
[14:23:27] James McKay: Uhh...Yeah What do you have?
[14:23:53] James McKay: /me Adjusts his suit, it seemingly being uncomfortable
[14:24:05] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//sorry bakc
[14:24:15] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: So, commanders control just the city and the forces inside of it.
[14:24:25] Jonathan Jackson: We have vegtables, some fruit, fish, and some other things I need to remember. We can sell them since they are ready made, but they are mostly ingredients.
[14:24:30] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The sectorial controls the city and all the area surrounding it.
[14:24:33] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: So, an example.
[14:24:37] James McKay: Hmm...
[14:24:41] Jonathan Jackson: Anything on the menu would take time to make.
[14:24:48] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Sectorial 17 has control over the city, the outlands, and Nova Prospekt.
[14:25:01] James McKay: Could I actually get 2 grilled ehh...
[14:25:06] James McKay: Tuna
[14:25:15] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Make sense?
[14:25:17] James McKay: Need to pick up somethin' for my room mate...
[14:25:19] CCA.C17-RCT.00344: Yeah.
[14:25:23] Jonathan Jackson: Sure thing!
[14:25:32] CCA.C17-RCT.00344: Commander is the right hand man and deals with the actual city.
[14:25:36] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Right.
[14:25:37] CCA.C17-RCT.00344: The Sectorial has more authority.
[14:25:45] Jonathan Jackson: I'll go prepare it, you can take a seat while you wait if you want.
[14:25:52] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: While there's a clear overlap, it's not really a problem. They tend to get along well, and they respect each others' boundaries.
[14:25:54] James McKay: /me Nods "Will do!"
[14:26:11] James McKay: /me Lets out a deep exhale
[14:26:18] James McKay: /me Begins to mumble to himself
[14:26:25] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: High command units also have no division.
[14:26:30] Jonathan Jackson: /me opens the fridge, grabbing out two fish from the inside resembling Tuna.
[14:26:32] James McKay: /w I didn't know he was...a...store owner...
[14:26:53] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: So, next pu, outside of the standard rank progression is quartermasters.
[14:27:06] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: They control the armory, keep inventory, and control living quarters.
[14:27:15] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: As far as you're concerned with your job, they give you your equipment.
[14:27:29] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: That's really all you need to know at this point. Not that their job is a secret, there's just no point in giving you that extra information
[14:27:48] Jonathan Jackson: /me places the fish on a special skillet, intended to grill on a stove.
[14:27:51] CCA.C17-RCT.00344: They have their job.
[14:27:52] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Alright, sociostatus.
[14:27:53] CCA.C17-RCT.00344: I have mine.
[14:28:03] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Sociostatus is a measurement of how the city's anti-civil activity is.
[14:28:07] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: How much of an issue it is.
[14:28:25] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: So, if the city is otherwise calm and fine, but then an SqL is suddenly murdered, but nothing else follows, sociostatus would be green the entire time.
[14:28:35] Jonathan Jackson: /me moves the item onto the stove, before turning it on to 200 degrees.
[14:28:41] Jonathan Jackson: There we go..
[14:28:44] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Because it's the actions of maybe a handful of people that resulted in that, compared to the rest of the city having nothing to do with it.
[14:29:00] Jonathan Jackson: Sir, would you like anything to drink?
[14:29:04] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Green means things are normal and calm. Maybe a barfight or maybe a mugging, but overall fine.
[14:29:06] James McKay: Uhh...No thank you...
[14:29:19] Jonathan Jackson: Alright, just let me know if you do.
[14:29:23] James McKay: Yeah...
[14:29:28] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Sociostatus yellow means anti-civil activity
[14:29:39] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//that was a dumb sentence
[14:29:48] CCA.C17-RCT.00344: Moderate anti-civil activity?
[14:29:50] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Yellow means that activity is more of a problem, but is still well manageable.
[14:29:52] Jonathan Jackson: /me starts adding some olive oil onto the fish in the pan, as well as a small amount of butter.
[14:29:54] James McKay: /ooc Me sweating and silently waiting for my food...
[14:29:59] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: More frequent muggings, but other than that, calm.
[14:30:03] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //helix you have my permission to call a ration cycle
[14:30:08] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //helix gone
[14:30:09] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //FUCk
[14:30:11] Jonathan Jackson: // I can do that in a bit lol
[14:30:15] Jonathan Jackson: // I'm cooking lmao
[14:30:18] CCA.C17-RCT.00344: Sorry to interrupt.
[14:30:19] CCA.C17-RCT.00344: But.
[14:30:25] CCA.C17-RCT.00344: Nevermind.
[14:30:33] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: alright
[14:30:40] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Red means there's something major.
[14:30:43] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: A protest or a riot, normally.
[14:30:51] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Something not totally under control, but able to be controlled with some effort.
[14:31:10] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Black means the city has been overtaken and the Combine is no longer in control.
[14:31:18] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: It won't happen, never has, never will.
[14:31:28] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Alright, sentencing.
[14:31:39] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The punishment for any given crime depends on its severity level.
[14:31:40] Jonathan Jackson: It will take about 2-4 more minutes sir, here is an appetizer for now.
[14:31:44] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Each crime has a level, 1-7.
[14:31:52] Jonathan Jackson: /me produces a bag of peanuts, and places them on the table.
[14:32:04] James McKay: Oh...uh, Thanks!
[14:32:11] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Level 1 is something minor, level 7 is capital punishment. Death.
[14:32:11] Jonathan Jackson: No problem! 
[14:32:19] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Level 1 violations don't always need to be pursued.
[14:32:25] James McKay: /me Would grab the peanuts, almost taking off his mask before quietly putting the peanuts into his bag
[14:32:33] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Running is a level 1 violation, but you don't need to prosecute everyone you see running.
[14:32:48] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Now, if they're running with a group of people, or there's something else suspicious about them, then you would.
[14:32:54] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Make sense?
[14:33:01] CCA.C17-RCT.00344: Yeah.
[14:33:03] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: fantastic
[14:33:10] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Level 1 violations are just punished with quick re-education.
[14:33:14] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: No LP loss.
[14:33:24] Jonathan Jackson: /me grabs a spatula, moving over towards the stove.
[14:33:35] Jonathan Jackson: /me then flips the fish over, letting the other side get cooked.
[14:33:36] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: For detainment, the number of cycles served depends on the severity of the crime. This information can be found in your handbook, go over that when you need to.
[14:33:40] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: It's a lot of numbers and such.
[14:33:46] Paul-Henri Cartier: /charsetclass jon civil
[14:33:49] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Alright, re-education has 4 types.
[14:33:55] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Minor, moderate, major, and on the spot.
[14:34:05] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: // brb
[14:34:07] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The first three, you get them on the wall and give them a certain number of hits at a certain voltage.
[14:34:15] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: That information is in your handbook.
[14:34:39] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: On the spot is simple. You don't get them on the wall, you jsut outright hit them.
[14:34:43] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//on the spot is what the CPs in HL2 do
[14:34:53] Jonathan Jackson: Sorry for bothering you again, but would you like it packaged to be ate later?
[14:34:55] CCA.C17-RCT.00344: /looc So beat the living fuck out of them?
[14:34:59] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//no, no, no
[14:35:03] James McKay: Uhh...Yeah that'll be great...

[14:35:35] Jonathan Jackson: /me grabs the skillet, and brings it over to a table.

[14:36:05] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//cool
[14:36:12] Jonathan Jackson: /me takes the fish off the skillet, and places it on a plate.
[14:36:13] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//3-4 hits while the stunstick is on knocks them out automatically
[14:36:19] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//always have the stunstick on when using it

[14:36:59] Jonathan Jackson: Alright, here you go sir.
[14:37:04] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: So, performing a search is simple.
[14:37:06] Jonathan Jackson: /looc Pretend that it is Tuna lol
[14:37:11] James McKay: /looc alr lol
[14:37:17] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: You get them on the wall, have them spread their legs and arms, and pat them down, go thnrough their pockets, and any bags they're carrying with them
[14:37:20] Client "FB|| light ROOM" connected.
[14:37:22] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//the command i'm sure you know, is /charsearch
[14:37:26] CCA.C17-RCT.00344: /looc yeah.
[14:37:26] Jonathan Jackson: /me puts down two packages with the Tuna inside, stamped with a Grizzlly Grotto logo.
[14:37:27] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//you don't need to zip tie someone to search them
[14:37:35] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//but if you search them wtihout tying them, it shows a window asking if they resist
[14:37:41] Paul-Henri Cartier: // lights getting on
[14:37:42] James McKay: /me Would take them, putting them into a bag
[14:37:44] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//it's much easier to not tie them
[14:37:48] James McKay: Thanks...
[14:37:49] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//and takes much less time
[14:37:51] Jonathan Jackson: You can come over to the register.
[14:38:04] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//do that unless you're taking them into the nexus or they're being a little asshole and hitting things
[14:38:10] James McKay: /me Would quickly put 16 tokens onto the table
[14:38:10] Jonathan Jackson: It will be sixteen tokens total.
[14:38:14] James McKay: /droptokens 16
[14:38:18] Jonathan Jackson: /me takes the tokens.
[14:38:24] James McKay: /me Would lean a bit over the counter 
[14:38:26] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Alright, something you need to know, a common code.
[14:38:29] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Code SWORD.
[14:38:29] Jonathan Jackson: Thank you sir! Also before you go...
[14:38:30] James McKay: /w The Doctor sends his thanks
[14:38:34] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: There are a lot more them that, read those on your own time.
[14:38:36] James McKay: /me Would put a ration onto the table
[14:38:38] Jonathan Jackson: /me places a water bottle, then stops
[14:38:47] Jonathan Jackson: /w wha?
[14:38:50] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Normally, when you're out, you keep your hand empty or you keep your stunstick in your hand.
[14:38:51] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Make sense?
[14:38:55] James McKay: /w He wishes to see you around...
[14:39:02] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: When code SWORD is called, you keep your firearm out
[14:39:05] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Don't raise it, keep the safety on.
[14:39:05] James McKay: /me Would take the water before running out the door

[15:39:27] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: /me sighed, grabbing the USP Match before him as he slid off the slide, looking into the internals of it's firing mechanism he would start rubbing it with a small rag, dripped in gun oil. "Huh? christ, finally."
[15:39:35] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: The one guy that makes sure we have enugh 'verdicts' to 'amputate' parasites.

[15:40:48] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: /me sighed, tapping something unknown onto the terminal before him, as a cheese kit of Russian origin formed from below. "Great.."
[15:41:37] Jonathan Jackson: // chilln
[15:42:14] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: /me would huff, grabbing 003 by the shoulder he'd give him a look over. "I'll have to replace the MPCV later.... whatever." as he rolled up the units sleeve, flicking up the AI-2 in a skilled manner he would take out several pain killers and anti-biotics from the cheese like kit, finding a vein in the units wrist he'd stab him with several syringes, lowering his pain and likely making him feel better. He'd roll the units sleeve down , huffing.
[15:42:22] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: There
[15:42:30] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: I should probably stop getting into fights with Necrotics.

[15:44:04] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: /me glanced towards the units stunstick. "No need to keep that out, you won't be beating me if you know what's good for you."
[15:44:09] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: /looc oh you put it awa-
[15:45:08] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: /me snickered as he grabbed onto the units shoulders, looking over the MPCV 3 chest plate he'd tug on several different straps, lightly punching them in the chest and what not. He'd huff. "Looks fine.... make sure the vest is as tight as possible, basic training shit."
[15:45:25] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: Yeah yeah.

Tugging on several different straps and patches, he'd run a hand across the slightly damaged MPCV 3. "I'm replacing the chest plate, it has too many micro tears along with the obvious, one second>"

[15:47:16] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: /me returned, holding a brown vest that appeared pristine in quality. "Righty..."
[15:47:49] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: /me shoved it into 003s chest, grasping the unit by the shoulder. "Take care of your equipment, and it'll take care of you, both of you are dismissed."

[15:51:06] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: Understandable.
[15:51:29] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: /me tossed three magazines over, sniffling.
