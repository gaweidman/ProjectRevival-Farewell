[20:30:43] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: No Citizen, of no loyalty status should be trusted.
[20:30:49] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: I advise we question him more.
[20:30:51] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: Use different methods.
[20:30:54] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: Something is off about him.
[20:31:02] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: He's too much of, factually speaking, a kiss ass.
[20:31:05] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: It means he wants something.
[20:31:06] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: Let me tell you
[20:31:18] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: You're half right. At least in my opinion.
[20:31:54] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: Citizens shouldn't be trusted. Someone exclusively seeking out loyalist points with no other goal is suspicious.
[20:32:06] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: He has currently 150 Loyalty points.
[20:32:06] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: Alex does good work, though. outside of seeking loyalist points.
[20:32:27] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: His work for the ICT, to me at least, comes off as honest.
[20:32:42] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: I see a desire there to serve in some capacity.
[20:32:48] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: But his story isn't adding up, that part is true.
[20:33:02] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: But still, somebody with that many loyalist points, it's in the hundreds, you can give some trust to.
[20:33:16] Amaterasu<STEAM_0:1:69619445> changed their name to Zhou Xinchi
[20:33:29] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: You don't take orders from loyalists, but if it's a loyalist's word against a 0 LPer, chances are good the loyalist is telling the truth.
[20:33:32] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: //Welcome!
[20:33:38] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: Officer.
[20:33:40] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: // Welcome
[20:33:41] Zhou Xinchi: // Hello there.
[20:33:42] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: If I may.
[20:33:47] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: New citizen. Are you familiar with processing?
[20:33:59] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: Yeah...
[20:34:03] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: I'll deal with the Citizen.
[20:34:13] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: //I'll send a unit over to process you real quick, standby
[20:34:18] Zhou Xinchi: //Affirmative.
[20:34:26] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: Fantastic. If you're not sure about a part of the process, look in your handbook.
[20:34:33] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: Before I do go.,
[20:34:40] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: Status doesn't mean you should trust them.
[20:34:43] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: .//please make sure to OOCly mention the current year and the yearof the war and the min year
[20:34:48] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: /looc What's the current yea-
[20:34:49] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: .//1985 is the min year, it has to be 1985 or before
[20:34:52] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: .//current year is 2006
[20:34:54] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: .//war was 2003
[20:34:54] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: /looc Copy.
[20:35:00] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: I agree.
[20:35:02] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: You're correct
[20:35:02] Zhou Xinchi: //By the way, are applications here IC or forum based? Or perhaps discord?
[20:35:05] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: But I just said.
[20:35:08] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: I know.
[20:35:11] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: We'll talk later about it.
[20:35:12] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: // forum
[20:35:15] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: Sure.
[20:35:26] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: //Forum based, although CWU applications are an exception, those are done ICly.
[20:35:49] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: alright, so we know he wasn't in the most recent operation.
[20:35:52] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: Where do we go from here?
[20:36:53] Zhou Xinchi: /me would give the officer a small wave, suitcase in hand.
[20:37:01] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: We ask him in a comfortable setting when the last time he was in the sewers for ICT business. See if he tells us something we don't already know. If we get a unit who can question him in a way where he doesnt feel questioned we'd likely get more accurate information.
[20:37:04] Zhou Xinchi: Hello, wonderful city trainstation you have here, officer.
[20:37:12] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: Especially if he lets something slip out on accident without thinking.
[20:37:19] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: Yes yes, quite...Clean, we'll say clean, yeah.
[20:37:30] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: Hand over your transfer card.
[20:37:34] Zhou Xinchi: Sure thing.
[20:37:38] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: If that doesn't work we may have to take more drastic measures.
[20:37:47] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: .//i'm trying to avoid that because he's not on but let me message him and see if he wants to get on
[20:38:07] Zhou Xinchi: /me would open their suitcase in front of the officer, taking their time with their movements as to display clearly what they are reaching for at all times. Taking out a small ID card, as they approached the railing, and extended their hand to give it to them.
[20:38:14] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: .// feels like the only real way, we have no camera evidence in the construction zones or sewers
[20:38:32] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: We could bring in people who are often affiliated with city business who may know more about him.
[20:38:51] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: They won't lie for someone who talks down to them for not being as "loyal" as him.
[20:38:58] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: /me grabs the transfer card swiftly from the Citizen's hands and inspects it, the man walking over to the fence and scanned the transfer card through the machine. He would simply wait until a fresh CID was produced.
[20:39:06] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: .//we can do that
[20:39:11] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: .//if he doesn't get on
[20:39:16] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: .//he's not repsondiung so
[20:39:18] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: We could pull in Johnathan Jackson to start.
[20:39:20] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: .//he's probaly at work
[20:39:25] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: .// makes sense
[20:39:27] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: What do they know about each other?
[20:39:28] Zhou Xinchi: So, the filters for this mask I was issued? How often do I purchase more, by the way?
[20:39:38] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: You can purchase them any time.
[20:39:44] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: I'll direct you to the area of purchase.
[20:39:50] Zhou Xinchi: Sure, I appreciate it.
[20:39:54] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: /me Pulls out the CID from his pockets and hands it to the man.
[20:40:07] Zhou Xinchi: /me would take the card, placing it into their suitcase once again.
[20:40:10] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: /viewdata Zhou
[20:40:12] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: They've been affiliated during a work shift. This was when I was a regular citizen it was John, Alex, myself, and an OTA protective unit.
[20:40:19] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: /looc FYI.

[20:40:33] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: /looc We're set in the year of 2006, 2003 was the war and the minimum you can be born is 1986.
[20:40:45] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: They could've had another run in we don't know about. It wouldn't hurt to ask.
[20:40:47] Zhou Xinchi: [[Of course, and how do I tell when I need a new filter?
[20:41:05] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: /looc Hover over your suit.
[20:41:09] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: alright.
[20:41:13] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: Let's go about it, then.
