[13:29:10] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: well, what I gathered from my interrogation is two stories: one that he worked at black mesa and knew Freeman personally, and one where he was just told about Freeman. Though his CID stated "Dr" Andrew Reeves, so I guess the former
[13:29:31] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: Hm
[13:29:39] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: He did say he was lying about the Biotic, so assuming he was, he worked at Black Mesa and knew Freeman personally
[13:30:05] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: Great. I doubt he has that much of a ego to lie about being a Black Mesa employee.
[13:30:40] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: I agree. He was rather compliant, though not smart. Gave himself away to an officer outside of the train station area.
[13:31:12] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: If this random man knew Freeman, then there could very well be other Black Mesa employees who knew him and know things we do not yet.
[13:31:25] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: It's best to keep our eyes, and ears, open for any talk of Freeman.
[13:31:47] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: I suggest we keep a lookout for these ex employees. Even if they don't know shit, they're still valuable for our science UU shit.
[13:32:06] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: Affirmative.
[13:32:20] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: So, if you hear anyone speak about being a ex employee, pry at their memories a bit and see if they really are.
[13:32:34] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: got it. I recommend they be kept alive, so long as they don't mention Freeman in public.
[13:32:58] CCA.C14-HELIX.DvL.33698: Yeah. Don't need too many more deaths after... the incident a few days ago.
