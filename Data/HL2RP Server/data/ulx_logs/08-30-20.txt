[15:48:10] Ethan King: Hm....I have no idea on what I want, wouldn't you say it depends on what the Universal Union wants?
[15:48:28] UU-SeC.14: It is. I just want to know what you have to say.
[15:48:57] UU-SeC.14: Unimportant, of course. We have varying ideas.
[15:49:03] Ethan King: Hm, indeed
[15:49:09] UU-SeC.14: I must admit I find myself rather fascinated by men like yourself.
[15:49:30] UU-SeC.14: I would be lying if I said I was not at least considering your preservation.
[15:49:39] Ethan King: Hm, thank you, sir.
[15:50:06] UU-SeC.14: Do not thank me, we are not friends. You're loyal, and that's the only thing that matters.
[15:50:15] Ethan King: Understood, sir.
[15:51:00] UU-SeC.14: You will know sooner rather than later. Until then, I recommend you ensure everything on your bucket list is checked off in the event of other circumstances.
[15:51:44] Ethan King: Alright, i've done everything but kill one of my......rebel "Allies" 
[15:51:52] UU-SeC.14: Explain.
[15:53:08] Ethan King: Hm, sadly I wanted to kill one of them....specificly one that was annoying.....I requested for atleast one of them to be spared and allow me to rid them off of the Universal Unions body while in city 08....but they never catched any of them during my stay.
[15:53:53] Client "Milanesa :3™" connected.
[15:53:57] Ethan King: But, I can not complain. I've been given everything i've ever wanted so it is truly nothing.

[15:57:05] Ethan King: I notified city 08 of his presence of course.
[15:57:16] UU-SeC.14: And why the grudge?
[15:57:19] Ethan King: y
[15:57:19] UU-SeC.14: As opposed to others?

[15:58:01] Ethan King: Hm, the others were nothing more than people who believed into the rebellion.....but they never acted on it so much as the Watchers did...
[15:58:31] Ethan King: They have killed many soldiers and CCA.....they need to be delt with...they are top priority danger.
[15:58:54] UU-SeC.14: You've piqued my interest.

[16:02:22] UU-SeC.14: Wait a minute.
[16:02:27] Ethan King: Indeed, if they are in this city......most likely they are building teams.....at city 08 they were....well.....social.

[16:05:59] UU-SeC.14: Is there anything distinguishing about them?
[16:06:25] Ethan King: Hm....all of them had some type of Gasmask on......usually with the OTA vest on....
[16:06:47] Milanesa :3™<STEAM_0:0:445640226> changed their name to Gregory Smith
[16:06:52] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.22767: // howdy
[16:06:54] Ethan King: It was kinda like....the standard Watcher uniform.
[16:07:01] UU-SeC.14: //heya
[16:07:11] Ethan King: But one of them maybe had just a Civil protection vest on.
[16:07:17] UU-SeC.14: hm
[16:07:25] Gregory Smith: // hello
[16:07:27] UU-SeC.14: Interesting, put likely unrelated.
[16:07:31] UU-SeC.14: Alright.
[16:07:42] UU-SeC.14: Not to that.
[16:07:59] UU-SeC.14: There is another group of wanted men from back when.
[16:08:19] UU-SeC.14: Another highly dangerous group known for having the same garb.
[16:08:31] UU-SeC.14: But surely it's unrelated.
[16:08:55] Ethan King: Hm, do you have any reports on their behavior? like attacks and all that?
[16:08:57] UU-SeC.14: Those OTA vests were very popular rebel armor back in the day until we changed their design.
[16:09:30] UU-SeC.14: All I can say is they are responsible for the attack on a very valuable location.
[16:10:30] Ethan King: Hm.....it could possibly be unrelated, but....rebels are like rats.....they move from place to place finding things to destroy....It's not that impossible to think that a cousin group of the watchers has made their way into the city....
[16:10:47] Ethan King: But, unlikely as you said.
[16:10:55] UU-SeC.14: No, this attack is one elsewhere.
[16:11:01] UU-SeC.14: Well.
[16:11:04] UU-SeC.14: Was.
[16:11:10] Ethan King: Hm.....I see....
[16:11:31] UU-SeC.14: Unlikely. Likely not related.
[16:11:39] Ethan King: Indeed.
[16:11:55] Ethan King: .// Pressed my mic button be like.
[16:11:55] UU-SeC.14: Is there anything else you can give me?
[16:12:30] Ethan King: Hm.....one of them had a...Combine assault rifle or whatever it's called.
[16:12:48] Ethan King: Like, it fires energy?
[16:12:58] Ethan King: I'm sure you understand.
[16:13:11] UU-SeC.14: Like the one I carry around?
[16:13:16] Ethan King: Yes
[16:13:17] Ethan King: Indeed
[16:13:36] UU-SeC.14: The rebels love this weapon, that's not helpful.
[16:13:46] UU-SeC.14: And who did you want us to spare?
[16:13:51] UU-SeC.14: Not that we will definitely, but..
[16:13:56] UU-SeC.14: Out of curiosity.
[16:14:27] Ethan King: Hm....killing the one that did the most damage would be most affective....Watcher 3 would be wonderful to end with my own hands.
[16:14:34] Gregory Smith: // So... Do you like pinneaple pizza? i think i asked this before
[16:14:42] UU-SeC.14: No, that's not the question.
[16:14:43] Ethan King: But, I understand if you can't spare him.
[16:14:45] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.22767: // you have. multiple times
[16:14:51] Gregory Smith: // Alright
[16:14:51] UU-SeC.14: You said there was somebody you wanted us to spare?
[16:15:03] Gregory Smith: // It's like my phrase when nothing happens

[16:15:46] Gregory Smith: // How's the weather like irl?
[16:15:48] Ethan King: Hm, I was going to say......I think his name is.....Jimmy? but he's most likely a rotting corpse in city 08 by now.
[16:15:54] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.22767: // pretty good rn
[16:15:55] UU-SeC.14: //no, i'm joking
[16:16:06] UU-SeC.14: Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.
[16:16:10] Ethan King: He tried to scavenge a Radio by breaking it.

[16:16:13] UU-SeC.14: I know that name.
[16:16:22] Ethan King: So, you understand the type of person he is.
[16:16:28] Ethan King: Dumb as a brick.

[16:16:55] UU-SeC.14: Couple bullets short of a magazine, eh?
[16:17:01] Ethan King: Indeed so.
[16:17:08] UU-SeC.14: /me chuckles a bit more.
[16:17:09] UU-SeC.14: Alriht.
[16:17:13] UU-SeC.14: Seriously, I know that name.
[16:17:21] Ethan King: Ah, good to know.
[16:17:22] UU-SeC.14: I feel like he died.
[16:17:25] UU-SeC.14: I think.
[16:17:26] UU-SeC.14: Maybe.
[16:17:27] Gregory Smith: w
[16:17:38] Ethan King: Yeah, I was expecting him to be dead by now.
[16:17:42] UU-SeC.14: I was forwarded the files of all of you from City 8.
[16:17:51] Ethan King: Ah, I see.
[16:17:54] UU-SeC.14: Jimmy. Heat?
[16:18:03] Ethan King: Hm.....YES, I think thats his name.
[16:18:19] UU-SeC.14: And why do you want us to spare him? Pity?
[16:18:44] Ethan King: At this point...I think he was just confused on which side to choose...and a little pity for his sad existence.
[16:19:03] UU-SeC.14: Interesting,
[16:19:23] Gregory Smith: /chardesc Brown hair, seems arounnd 47,His height is 6'2", he has Brown eyes
[16:19:42] UU-SeC.14: .//if you have rythm muted, unmut eit
[16:19:48] Ethan King: but of course, he stole weapons from rebels and what not.....so he could be dangerous at the moment.
[16:20:04] Gregory Smith: // So, we're at 2006
[16:20:07] Gregory Smith: // No?
[16:20:11] UU-SeC.14: //correct
[16:20:16] Ethan King: If he's not dead of course.
[16:20:19] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.22767: // i thought it was 2001
[16:20:23] Gregory Smith: // and why when i press tab and go to "You" it says 2001?

[16:20:43] Ethan King: .// This song has scared me.
[16:20:52] UU-SeC.14: I feel like they would probaby look down the barrel out of curiosity
[16:21:11] Ethan King: /me Breaks and lets out a good chuckle.
[16:21:24] Ethan King: Ugh....god.....that is so accurate..
[16:21:34] UU-SeC.14: Yes, I was being serious,

[16:21:45] UU-SeC.14: Zero irony or joking.

[16:21:48] Ethan King: Indeed, he would most likely just to see if it was jamming.
[16:22:14] UU-SeC.14: I think with that it's time to close this session.
[16:22:19] Ethan King: Indeed so, sir.
[16:22:24] UU-SeC.14: The next time I see you, I will have news for you.
[16:22:33] Ethan King: Wonderful to know.
[16:22:43] UU-SeC.14: As to where to go from here.
