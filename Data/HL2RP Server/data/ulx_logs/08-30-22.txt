[16:12:19] Jonathan Jackson: I don't know where you live let alone what is being drawn there
[16:12:47] Tanya L. Fredrickson: The apartments behind this shop- they had it posted up scrapped onto the wall...it's getting to be annoying.

[16:19:08] Jonathan Jackson: We can filter the tap as you please.
[16:19:12] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Tap'll do please.
[16:19:20] Jonathan Jackson: Sure thing, anything to eat as well?
[16:19:32] Tanya L. Fredrickson: nah- just filled up on some lettuce flavor.
[16:19:46] Jonathan Jackson: Alright, no problem, I'll be right back.
[16:20:20] Jonathan Jackson: /it You hear some cabinets opening and closing in the back, as well as the sound of a cup being filled.
[16:21:08] Jonathan Jackson: /me places a glass holding some regular water inside of it on the counter, "Here you are."
[16:21:16] Jonathan Jackson: /looc Pretend that is the cup.
[16:21:17] Tanya L. Fredrickson: t's the cost lad?
[16:21:43] Jonathan Jackson: Only two tokens, no point in charging much for just water right?
[16:21:56] Tanya L. Fredrickson: /me takes out two small coins, handing them to the man.

[16:23:33] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Hah- I do aye it's Tanya.

[16:24:08] Jonathan Jackson: Tanya?
[16:24:14] Jonathan Jackson: That's how you pronounce it right?
[16:24:58] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Aye Aye, Tanya.
[16:25:40] Jonathan Jackson: Good to meet you, feel free to come back any time you get hungry, just remember to check the sign to see if we're open. I'm afraid the hours are slightly inconsistent.

[16:28:14] Jonathan Jackson: I'm sure!
[16:28:26] Jonathan Jackson: Anyways what were we on abou- ah right.
[16:28:53] Jonathan Jackson: So yeah, appearently this place needs two owners to run, at least that's what CWU Commerce Administration said.

[16:30:32] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: // hello
[16:31:10] Jonathan Jackson: So me and him set this place up, get a list of everything we need, furniture, cutlery, ingredients, etc.
[16:31:58] Jonathan Jackson: Then as soon as we start getting it all delievered, it almost seems like he disapears, never seen him since. I know he lives still in the appartment still because he brings in containers, but I never see the man.
[16:32:23] Jonathan Jackson: So since as soon as we opened for the first time, I've been running the whole show myself.
[16:33:03] Jonathan Jackson: Starting to get worried about him, hope he's not getting involved with something less than savory since those rarely work out well, ask that Alex guy they hunting down now.
[16:33:18] Jonathan Jackson: /me sighs, "Anyways, that's the situation."
[16:33:55] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Sounds rough- I am actually in a rough patch myself...I am technically the only CMU phasician in the entire sector that isn't administration staff or a filler...
[16:34:55] Jonathan Jackson: I heard of that, I'm pretty sure Administration is trying to find some people with medical experience who aren't scooped up by the CPs yet.
[16:35:11] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Hah- good luck...
[16:35:18] Jonathan Jackson: Yeah, tough to find.
[16:35:36] Jonathan Jackson: // Virgin CP rp versus chad CWU rp
[16:35:52] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Sad thing is I really don't have anything to do...
[16:36:09] Tanya L. Fredrickson: No one ever comes to the clinic so I am just sitting behind a fucking desk all day doing nothing.
[16:36:52] Jonathan Jackson: I hear due to the lesser amount of the staff, people are resorting to underground clinics, or just buying those UU bandages.
[16:37:03] Jonathan Jackson: Doesn't help the service is technically locked to loyalists.
[16:37:07] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Yep...
[16:37:19] Tanya L. Fredrickson: So now I am just sitting here waiting to patch people who never need patching
[16:37:24] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Doing nothing, and getting paid nothing
[16:37:41] Jonathan Jackson: Jeez, no pay? That's rough.
[16:37:53] Tanya L. Fredrickson: I am paid on commission, patient to patient basis...
[16:38:08] Jonathan Jackson: Maybe I'll come in for a checkup sometime, that way you can pay your bills, feel bad for your situation
[16:38:38] Jonathan Jackson: I'd think someone like you would get a payrate, unlike Commerce.
[16:39:02] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Hah- no one gets a payrate it's all commision
[16:39:10] Jonathan Jackson: // Nums trying not to be on Combine 24/7.

[16:40:27] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Eventually I am gonna run outta money and be forced to do something that's outside my field, and my only thought would be is...why have sucha big clinic for loyalists when whoever gets hurt is always patched up by themselves for some reason, or the standing MPF handle it.

[16:41:53] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Eh- I wouldn't say that but from a certain point of view sure...but whoever they deal with aren't loyalists so it's sorta bust for me to treat anyone.
[16:42:54] Jonathan Jackson: You'd think that, yet they arrest me on the spot on the street tryin to interrogate me about some guy I don't know. Ythink they would treat their loyalist with more respect right?
[16:43:18] Tanya L. Fredrickson: I guess...this city is really different from city eight, and twelve.
[16:43:59] Jonathan Jackson: Yep, CPs can't even stop an unarmed guy from killing three of their officers at a train station before calling in OTA.
[16:44:01] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Back then I was so flush with patients I had to sleep in the clinic overnight to help care for them, and I was paid thousands a day just for checkups alone...
[16:44:18] Jonathan Jackson: Thousands? I wish. Most people keep to themselves here.
[16:44:34] Jonathan Jackson: Don't want to say or do anything getting them in trouble.
[16:44:49] Tanya L. Fredrickson: hell I was the richest person, had nearly half a million and almost bought out the clinic before the city collapsed.
[16:45:08] Jonathan Jackson: Not really any stability any more eh?
[16:45:17] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Sadly, no...
[16:46:07] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Just makes me hope that someone a few chains up takes notice and does something about it, but I've written a petition to the administrator already and he's never responded.
[16:46:42] Jonathan Jackson: Ha! I did the same after they arrested and beat me for some guy I don't know. See if administration really cares about it.
[16:46:42] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: // returned
[16:46:46] Jonathan Jackson: // Welcome
[16:47:00] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.77460: // Thank ye.
[16:47:17] Jonathan Jackson: Some good people in there, just a lot of bureaucracy.
[16:47:26] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Just makes me feel like a fuckin guppy that's not working at all- like I literally have not treated anyone in what...two- no three weeks.
[16:48:00] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Wanna know how I am surviving? Rations, the three tokens you get...that's all I have to buy clothes, rent, food, everything.
[16:48:08] Jonathan Jackson: Hey, I'll stop by later if it means you get a paycheck, just working for some income kind of an income myself.
[16:48:31] Jonathan Jackson: You mind if I say something off the radar? Don't go telling a CP about this.
[16:48:45] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Aye, what's on your mind
[16:49:16] Jonathan Jackson: But I've heard those zombies down in the CZ and Sewers have a load of tokens on them, sometimes even 40 a peace. I heard from one guy who came in, he got 75 tokens in one run taking care of those zombies.
[16:49:44] Jonathan Jackson: Provided you are good with a weapon, you might get some nice side income to actually pay your bills.
[16:50:00] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Not really a fighter lad- hands are nimble but not firm
[16:50:36] Jonathan Jackson: Hey, just mentioning it. From what I heard it's by far the best way to make a livable wage.
[16:51:14] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Jesus- what's city life come too where we gotta kill to earn a wage rather then just working...
[16:51:42] Jonathan Jackson: I don't know if it's killing or rather putting that thing out of it's misery but I digress.
[16:52:13] Jonathan Jackson: CWU still a good gig, but it doesn't sound like the medical industry is really cutting it.
[16:52:22] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Its really not.
[16:52:29] Jonathan Jackson: So it would seem.
[16:52:58] Jonathan Jackson: Unless you want to become a black tier suck up to the combine, rations don't provide that much tokens but it helps.
[16:53:16] Jonathan Jackson: Work desk sometimes gives you some tokens for doing stuff, mostly LP though.
[16:53:22] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Aye...
[16:53:36] Tanya L. Fredrickson: well Ima go try just that
[16:53:41] Jonathan Jackson: /me stretches his arms a bit and yawns.
[16:53:47] Jonathan Jackson: Good luck with that.
[16:53:52] Jonathan Jackson: Also before you go-
[16:53:52] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Aye, you too lad.
[16:54:10] Jonathan Jackson: If the officer at the work desk asks if it's okay for you to be restrained.
[16:54:14] Jonathan Jackson: Start running.
[16:54:21] Tanya L. Fredrickson: What?
[16:54:24] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Why?
[16:54:51] Jonathan Jackson: Because otherwise they will take you off the street and interrogate you for some guy you don't know about.
[16:55:01] Jonathan Jackson: That includes using their stunsticks.
[16:55:12] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Wouldn't they just shoot you if you ran?
[16:55:25] Jonathan Jackson: They'll chase, but not shoot.
[16:55:40] Client "Xadek" connected.
[16:55:50] Jonathan Jackson: Just be careful with it, all I'm saying, you really, really don't want to get caught up in that shit.
[16:56:08] Jonathan Jackson: I still have the burn marks and bruises from it.
[16:56:13] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Honestly if it gets any worse Ill just request a transfer.
[16:56:26] Jonathan Jackson: Either way good luck.
[16:56:40] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Likewise friend.

[19:11:50] Tanya L. Fredrickson: So, what seems to be the issue my boy, or is this just an exsplorative checkup?
[19:12:13] Jonathan Jackson: Just a checkup, no issues that I have as of now.
[19:12:40] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Hm, alright then well Ill check your BP, and your heart rate, your breathing, and reflexes and then well move on from there okay?
[19:12:54] Jonathan Jackson: Alright.
[19:13:27] Tanya L. Fredrickson: /me Grabbing their stethescope, they would start out by placing it softly on the center of his chest, counting two seperate numbers in their head at once as they listen to his heart rate.
[19:13:55] Jonathan Jackson: /me brethes in and out normally.
[19:14:15] Tanya L. Fredrickson: /me placing it on his back, she would check for any abnormalities in his breathing.
[19:14:49] Jonathan Jackson: /me continues to breathe normally.
[19:14:57] Jonathan Jackson: /looc I mispelled the first time 
[19:16:04] Tanya L. Fredrickson: /me Looking at his heart rate, they would nod as it is at a normal level, only then would they pull out a small BP pressure  guage, unwrapping the fabric with a harsh whelsch noise, placing it around his arm she'd start pumping it up, whilst reading the gauge writing all of this information down.
[19:16:41] Jonathan Jackson: /looc You can probably judge for yourself that I am still breathing normally.
[19:16:56] Tanya L. Fredrickson: .// this is a BP test, not a heartrate test.
[19:17:15] Tanya L. Fredrickson: .// Does he have any sort of desises, like diabetus
[19:17:17] Jonathan Jackson: /looc I mean if you do anything else
[19:17:32] Jonathan Jackson: /it The bloodpressure seems normal enough.
[19:18:28] Tanya L. Fredrickson: /me taking off the wrap, she would then pull out a small plastic hammer, gentley tapping on his joints he would tap on his legs to start off with, then moving upwards around the inner section of his arms, writst, then the sides of his shoulders...all two or three soft taps.
[19:20:11] Jonathan Jackson: /it the respective joints appear to have normal reflexes.
[19:20:19] Jonathan Jackson: /looc The*
[19:20:37] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Right, from what I can tell it's normal across the board no real deviations from the standard...
[19:20:54] Jonathan Jackson: That's good, I would hope not.
[19:21:30] Jonathan Jackson: /looc I have the highest possible agility so I would hope so
[19:21:59] Tanya L. Fredrickson: That being said you are a bit underweight, might wanna try to get a bit more nutrients in your diet.
[19:22:37] Jonathan Jackson: Yeah, I'll admit for a while there I wasn't making enough tokens to get food, but I should be in the green now.
[19:22:51] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Right, other then that you should be alright.
[19:23:14] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Do you want any other checkups- I can do a more specific one for a higher price.
[19:23:35] Jonathan Jackson: Mm sure, you seem like you can use the money.
[19:24:20] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Right, here are my fields of exspertise...chriopracticy, muscle and bone development, and general care of the eyes.
[19:24:56] Jonathan Jackson: Go with the first one, I don't know what it means but I assume it is good to check.
[19:25:14] Tanya L. Fredrickson: It's like popping your back, making sure your bones are alligned
[19:25:17] Tanya L. Fredrickson: stuff like that.
[19:25:36] Jonathan Jackson: Ah alright, sure then.
[19:26:02] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Right then, could you remove your shirt and lie flat on your belly.
[19:26:12] Jonathan Jackson: Uh sure.
[19:26:32] Jonathan Jackson: /me takes off his shirt, revealing nothing noteworthy.
[19:26:51] Jonathan Jackson: /me proceeds to lie back on his stomach.
[19:27:07] Jonathan Jackson: /charfallover
[19:27:14] Jonathan Jackson: /looc put on bed lol
[19:27:27] Jonathan Jackson: /looc Or the examination table rather
[19:27:44] Tanya L. Fredrickson: /me Starting off with putting gloves on, she'd then start by looking at his upper back feeling his shoulder blades and vertibre of his back, her thumbs pressing softly on the bones checking for allignment.
[19:28:50] Jonathan Jackson: /looc I can't act like I know this so you do the roleplay from here, if I know something I'll chime in.
[19:29:52] Tanya L. Fredrickson: /me Looking over his spine, she would spot a few out of place vertibre, nothing noteworthy just one quick adjustment and it would be fine, taking no time she'd start by locating the specific out of place vertibre before firmly pressing downward on his back pushing it into place.
[19:31:01] Tanya L. Fredrickson: /me In quick succession they would count out the bones in his back before moving to his lower back, finding it tense and seemingly a bit redder then an average back due to strain from standing all day, so feeling it softly they would locate the highly out of place bone and with one quick motion softly push it back into place with a resounding pop and a warm feeling in the area...
[19:32:01] Tanya L. Fredrickson: /me looking over his back, she'd then move to softly feel his shoulder, checking it for anything...finding nothing they'd move down to his hands, popping all of his fingers to release any pressure buildup.
[19:32:10] Tanya L. Fredrickson: /me repeats the same cycle on the other side.
[19:32:31] Tanya L. Fredrickson: /me finishing the overall examination and light adjustments they'd pat him on the shoulder gesturing for him to sit up.
[19:32:49] Jonathan Jackson: /me lifts himself up with his arms.
[19:32:52] Jonathan Jackson: /chargetup
[19:33:14] Jonathan Jackson: /me puts back on his shirt as soon as he gets back up.
[19:33:22] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Feeling any better?
[19:33:56] Jonathan Jackson: /me thinks for a second before saying, "Yeah, it feel a bit more... relaxed?"
[19:34:05] Jonathan Jackson: I don't know how else to describe it.
[19:34:22] Jonathan Jackson: /me stretches a bit, leaning backwards.
[19:34:27] Jonathan Jackson: Definitely less tense.
[19:34:35] Tanya L. Fredrickson: That's a good thing.
[19:34:51] Jonathan Jackson: I'd be concerned if it wasn't.
[19:35:10] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Well- lets just say if some random shmuck tries to pop your back they could cripple you.
[19:35:38] Jonathan Jackson: Hm, that doesn't sounds good.
[19:35:55] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Right then, take however long you need and Ill be out in the lobby waiting on you to discuss checking out.
[19:36:12] Jonathan Jackson: /me gets up from sitting down.
[19:37:08] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Right, that will be ten credits.
[19:37:28] Jonathan Jackson: Alright, got it.
[19:37:45] Jonathan Jackson: /me fiddles around in his pocket before producing a couple of tokens.
[19:37:50] Jonathan Jackson: /droptokens 8
[19:37:52] Jonathan Jackson: Hold on
[19:38:00] Jonathan Jackson: /me looks into his other pocket getting out two tokens
[19:38:09] Jonathan Jackson: /droptokens two
[19:38:13] Jonathan Jackson: /droptokens 2
[19:38:46] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Right well, I can do regular checkups and chiropractic adjustments whenever you want- just try not to do it too often aye?
[19:39:05] Jonathan Jackson: Gotcha, thanks.
[19:39:25] Tanya L. Fredrickson: One more thing- I found this note in one of the vending machines jammed up
[19:39:29] Tanya L. Fredrickson: can you tell me what it means?
[19:39:35] Jonathan Jackson: What note?
[19:39:48] Tanya L. Fredrickson: /me moves over to the trash bin, picking up the note before sliding it across the counter.
[19:39:56] Jonathan Jackson: /me reads it over.
[19:40:03] Tanya L. Fredrickson: It was lodged into the machine, and it really spooked me...
[19:40:08] Jonathan Jackson: You found this in a vending machine?
[19:40:19] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Aye lad, you think someone is poisoning the water?
[19:40:26] Jonathan Jackson: Psh, doubt it
[19:40:34] Jonathan Jackson: This message doesn't really convey that
[19:40:59] Jonathan Jackson: I might know somebody doing this, I saw another one of these in the alley leading to the Grizzly Grotto.
[19:41:07] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Weird...
[19:41:09] Jonathan Jackson: Someone named "The Doctor"
[19:41:33] Tanya L. Fredrickson: This city is just getting weirder and weirder
[19:41:59] Jonathan Jackson: You tell me, I try not to get involved even if my mood tries to change that opinion.
[19:42:17] Jonathan Jackson: /me grabs the paper, "I'll throw this out for you if you want."
[19:42:27] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Nah, I am just gonna tear it up in the shreader
[19:42:34] Jonathan Jackson: Sure thing.
[19:42:38] Jonathan Jackson: /me drops the paper on the counter.
[19:42:46] Tanya L. Fredrickson: /me Takes the note before putting it into the respective shreader on its thinist setting
[19:43:05] Tanya L. Fredrickson: That being said- I am really fuckin terrified that someone's gonna do something that they'll regret and get people injured.
[19:43:46] Jonathan Jackson: As much as they call them Anti-Citizens they might care for citizens a lot more than the CPs sometime
[19:44:01] Jonathan Jackson: Either way, I wouldn't worry.
[19:44:09] Tanya L. Fredrickson: Least with CPs they have motive to protect us as long as we co-operate...
[19:44:41] Tanya L. Fredrickson: anti-citizens they just do what they want, when they want, how they want...some of the things I saw in my previous city were so grusome it keeps me up at night.
[19:44:58] Jonathan Jackson: Not in this city.
[19:45:05] Jonathan Jackson: I should be going though, take care.
[19:45:10] Jonathan Jackson: /me turns and walks
