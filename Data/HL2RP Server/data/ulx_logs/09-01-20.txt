[18:11:38] Ethan King: Indeed, that would be obvious. So why would aliens ever fucking care about me?
[18:11:56] Ethan King: Obviously the Sectorial does.
[18:12:01] Ethan King: .// Brb
[18:14:21] Ethan King: Back, you are dumbo
[18:14:49] Ethan King: Fair, but if he didn't have some use for me....why would he not just kill me?
[18:15:27] Client "Madeline Wuntch" connected.
[18:15:30] Ethan King: But why would he need to keep me alive? when have the Combine in any server EVER kept a person alive who is a rebel?

[18:15:56] Ethan King: Ethan is.....different.
[18:16:26] Ethan King: He's being allowed to live under the conditions which would usually be immediate amputation after they have already gotten all of the info out of me.
[18:16:43] Ethan King: And they have dried up most of my info, and yet i'm alive.
[18:17:19] Ethan King: Or he has plans for this char that he hasen't told anyone, I even have proof that he does.
[18:18:00] Ethan King: Mostly because the Sectorial recently talked to my Ethan and said that they were figuring out what to do with me, and that he wanted to keep me alive for soem reason.
[18:18:09] Ethan King: .// Some*
[18:18:19] Ethan King: Dumbo
[18:18:57] Ethan King: They would NEVER keep me alive for dumb fuckin reasons, have you seen how the sectorial acts? he kills off any and all rebels he finds.
[18:19:17] Ethan King: They most likely have a good reason to keep me alive and keep talking to me.
[18:19:28] Ethan King: If they didn't care for me then they would have stopped feeding me ages ago.
