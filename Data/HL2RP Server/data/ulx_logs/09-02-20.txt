[21:07:13] CCA.C14-GRID.OfC.29402: So dispatch magically knew that the doors would be open
[21:07:50] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.22767: Well they ordered a city sweep and suggested we check the factories so when we moved to that one assuming we'd be locked out, the doors opened.
[21:08:04] CCA.C14-GRID.OfC.29402: Mhm.

[21:08:34] CCA.C14-GRID.OfC.29402: The biolocked factories?
[21:08:59] CCA.C14-GRID.OfC.29402: So the rebel got in there magically then.
[21:09:01] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.22767: We searched there yes, but the one locked by a plank.
[21:09:18] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.22767: That's the abandoned one I've been talking about
[21:09:23] CCA.C14-GRID.OfC.29402: I understand that.

[23:07:03] OTA.C08-HAMMER.OWS.00519: /pm Ryan Sweeping because a suspect for a high level crime entered here.

[23:08:02] OTA.C14-HAMMER.OSS.00519: /pm Ryan Its a fair reason to go into the sewers.
[23:08:08] Ryan Marnett: /pm hammer what's the crime
[23:08:24] OTA.C14-HAMMER.OSS.00519: /pm ryan Running from CCA, Possibly Destroying Multiple Cameras.
[23:08:41] Ryan Marnett: /pm hammer and you deployed OTA for that.
[23:08:41] CCA.C14-UNION.i5.22767: /toggleraise
[23:08:54] Ryan Marnett: /pm hammer for possibly destroying multiple cameras, and running from CCA.
[23:09:00] OTA.C14-HAMMER.OSS.00519: /pm Ryan When it happens in the QZ too yeah
[23:09:14] Ryan Marnett: /pm hammer No. I don't even deploy OTA when a CP is killed.
[23:09:35] Ryan Marnett: /pm hammer and I said we very very very rarely do sewer sweeps unless shit is hitting the fan big time, like sociostatus red.
[23:09:53] OTA.C14-HAMMER.OSS.00519: /pm Ryan This is stupid that I cant, and other people in combine agree with me. But fine, I'll call off the search here.
[23:09:59] OTA.C14-HAMMER.OSS.00519: /radio Search has been called off.
[23:10:05] OTA.C14-HAMMER.OSS.00519: /radio Dispatch Requests it.
[23:10:53] OTA.C14-HAMMER.OSS.00519: /radio Unit moving to Storm for stasis.
[23:10:57] Ryan Marnett: /pm hammer Thank you. And for future reference, possibly destroying multiple cameras in the QZ and running from CCA is by no means enough to call in OTA. At the very least, you would get a grunt or two in to sweep through the surface of QZ.
[23:11:11] Ryan Marnett: /pm hammer Sorry, at most I mean.
