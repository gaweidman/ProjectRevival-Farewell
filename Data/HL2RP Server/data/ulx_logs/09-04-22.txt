[01:47:34] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: /radio And if there was explosive marks, why was there skull fragments.
[01:48:05] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /r If your head was blown up, your skull would absolutely fragment.
[01:48:26] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: /radio My point being, how would the fragments, and other bits be at the area if there were no explosive marks.
[01:48:50] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /r Oh, 10-4. I agree, it would have to be something stronger than a regular human.

[01:49:40] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: /radio Which also brings me to my next point, explosive marks would by on the clothing.
[01:50:04] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /r Especially shrapnel. And the rest of the body wouldn't be so unscathed.
[01:50:27] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: /radio 10-4. After this, I request HELIX training, unless you want to count that as HELIX training.
[01:50:33] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: /radio This is going to be a lengthly process.
[01:51:03] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /r If you want to do an autopsy, I approve. We could always use HELIX units.
[01:51:57] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: /me would place the body bag onto the table and opened it up and pushed it to the side, the man would then use his right hand to lift up the body and the left hand to remove the body-bag.

[01:52:06] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: /radio 10-4, I'll talk to you about becoming HELIX after this, if that's fine.
