[15:45:30] Lucius Strand: /ooc :)
[15:48:39] Lucius Strand: /ooc Well.. explains why nobody is active.

[15:56:58] James Albright teleported to Lucius Strand

[15:57:14] Lucius Strand: /ooc No worries. I sort of.. made by own way out.

[15:57:45] Lucius Strand: /ooc Haha thank you, sorry about that.
[15:57:55] James Albright: //nah you're all good, it's not like i was there to get youo ne
[15:58:32] James Albright: //if you need links to either, we've got /discord and /content comments

[15:58:56] James Albright: //kinda presumptuous, you haven't seen much :P
[15:58:58] Lucius Strand: /ooc I looked up the server content before joining, had trouble downloading the server content automatically.
[15:58:58] James Albright: //but thank you
[15:59:19] Lucius Strand: /ooc Maybe that's it actually, maybe people can't join without getting the content beforehand?

[16:00:48] James Albright: //people haven't bene on much recently becuase schoolwork has been bad ths week for me
[16:01:07] James Albright: //on an actual active day we're anywhere from 5-7 players
[16:01:15] James Albright: //it doesdn't sound like much but we still make things happen
[16:01:18] Lucius Strand: /ooc I see.. they shouldn't have to relay on you that much though, right?
[16:01:59] James Albright: /doorsethidden true
[16:02:01] Lucius Strand: /ooc rely*
[16:02:21] James Albright: //nah. we've got a staff team, it's a matter of coordinating who can be on and that. we're still having growing pains from me starting college
[16:03:22] Lucius Strand: /ooc I could host workshifts as CWU, read you needed civil workers.
[16:03:48] James Albright: //yeah, we do. the commerce branch is kidna hurting. most of our item sales we have done by vendor NPCs for now
[16:04:21] Lucius Strand: /ooc I have plenty of time at the moment, so it wouldn't hurt.
[16:04:36] James Albright: //well you can apply as soon as you get the 5 LP to join industrial, you're beyond welcome
[16:05:03] Lucius Strand: /ooc Alright, I might then, don't really do applications usually.
[16:06:04] James Albright: The CWU ones aren't really that bad, honestly. We try not to put as much of a bar on them just because it gives you more things to do as a citizen.
[16:06:19] James Albright: //The CWU ones aren't really that bad, honestly. We try not to put as much of a bar on them just because it gives you more things to do as a citizen.
[16:06:57] Lucius Strand: /ooc Hm..
[16:08:05] James Albright: //we try to stick out a bit. we're a really tight knit community
[16:08:30] Lucius Strand: /ooc I'm glad to hear, that's something I can appreciate.
[16:09:15] James Albright: //something i like to mention is how we do stories for our events
[16:09:18] James Albright: //we call them campaigns
[16:09:49] James Albright: //if you've ever played dungeons and dragons, it's the same concept. a long story spanning over a series of events that help give them direction, normally with some big idea or concept behind it
[16:10:30] James Albright: //on our SWRP server our last campaign, summed up crudely, was an inquisitor falling to the seduction of the dark side of the force and trying to reform the sith order
[16:10:36] Lucius Strand: /ooc I see, that does sound amazing. The day-to-day play has to be at least a bit enjoyable though.
[16:10:37] James Albright: //failing obviously because it's one man vs the empire but sitll
[16:11:27] James Albright: //yeah, we try. that's one of the things that we've been trying to put the most into, because the common idea of "oh well you can either walk in circles for hours or you can lolwebul" for most servers our size is quite honestly fucking terribe
[16:11:32] James Albright: //terrible*
[16:11:50] James Albright: //so we try to create cityRP
[16:12:41] James Albright: //recently i added in a carving and cooking system, programmed from scratch. So you can use the stoves in your apartments as actual stoves.
[16:12:57] James Albright: //then you can carve dead xenians (or whatever other aliens you can find) and cook them on the stove
[16:13:12] Lucius Strand: /ooc That is sweet, have you had Lua classes or taught yourself?
[16:13:38] James Albright: //self taught. i started computer science in high school with gamemaker in a computer science class
[16:13:44] James Albright: //that was what really made it click, was trying it in high school
[16:13:56] Lucius Strand: /ooc That's another thing I can appreciate. I'm a self-taught Java programmer!
[16:14:03] James Albright: //my first self taught langauge was actually C#, which is a step up from lua as far as complexity goes
[16:14:18] James Albright: //oh nice! i learned java in my AP CSA class
[16:14:27] Lucius Strand: /ooc I honestly love to write Java.
[16:14:40] Lucius Strand: /ooc It's the only language with a syntax I can honestly appreciate.
[16:14:56] James Albright: //yeah. C# is basically the same thing with like
[16:15:07] James Albright: //a couple other changes, and just different method capitalize
[16:15:11] James Albright: //capitalization*
[16:15:18] Lucius Strand: /ooc Yeah, C# I can stand.
[16:15:34] Lucius Strand: /ooc I prefer explicit syntax.
[16:15:39] Lucius Strand: Where you type out whole words etc.
[16:15:43] Lucius Strand: /ooc Where you type out whole words etc.
[16:15:46] Lucius Strand: I know some people hate that.
[16:15:51] Lucius Strand: /ooc I know some people hate that.
[16:15:52] James Albright: //i prefer java though. C# has like serialization and stuff for making classes, so i prefer java
[16:15:58] James Albright: //yeah
[16:16:26] James Albright: //i learned lua after the other two exclusively for garry's mod. painstakingly I might add, the syntax is way dfferent
[16:16:44] Lucius Strand: /ooc Yeah I've done Lua, I can't stand it, heh.
[16:17:07] James Albright: //yeah i started out the same way. strating with javascript and then C# and java, then downgrading to lua is really hard, but you get used to it after enough trying
[16:17:49] James Albright: //the pain of using it goes down over time
[16:18:12] Lucius Strand: /ooc Yeah, I'm sure you get used to it after a while.
[16:18:13] James Albright: //that's actually why we use helix
[16:18:19] James Albright: //i was pretty skeptical about it to start off
[16:18:26] James Albright: //just becuase i was used to CS
[16:18:32] James Albright: //sorry, CW*
[16:18:42] James Albright: //but then i found out helix has like actual documentation for its code
[16:18:43] Lucius Strand: /ooc I've done minimal work with the Helix framework, it seemed pretty neat.
[16:19:24] James Albright: //it's nice exclusively because of its documentation. It's not great, but it's there, which blows it out of the water compared to NS and CW.
[16:20:35] Lucius Strand: /ooc Probably because it's a bit more modern, right?
[16:21:05] James Albright: //i don't even know about that. i just think it's because, and i by no means want to compliment alex grist by saying this, but because alex grist gave slightly more of a shit
[16:21:11] Lucius Strand: /ooc They likely wrote both NS and CW without any documentation and then couldn't be asked to go through all of it and add it.
[16:22:06] James Albright: //yeah. plus helix is literally just nutscript but changed around a bit
[16:22:15] James Albright: //so documentation wouldn't be as hard

[16:23:42] Lucius Strand: /ooc That's a shame especially since it's just you and I at the moment.
[16:24:12] James Albright: //yeah. we still do them even if it's like 1 on 1. plus we've got a vendor with snax so citizens don't starve

[16:24:54] James Albright: //getting people all in one place is good to do that
[16:25:03] Lucius Strand: /ooc Well.. yeah.
[16:25:08] James Albright: //but yeah i also know a lot of servers are starting to do automated ration cycles
[16:25:33] James Albright: //i'm pretty old school, i'm an HL2RP boomer
[16:26:30] Lucius Strand: /ooc Same, but the main thing is that people will likely not stay if they have *nothing* to do (even if that something is to wait for rations.)
