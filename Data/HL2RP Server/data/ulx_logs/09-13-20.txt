[19:59:07] CCA.C14-UNION.i4.75391: Every Unit heard of that.
[19:59:29] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Ah, but he was proven to be a non rogue.
[19:59:49] CCA.C14-UNION.i4.75391: By who? He could have just pretended to be, your priorities are not correct.
[19:59:49] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: He alerted us of the HELIX.DvL being taken hostage.
[19:59:59] CCA.C14-UNION.i4.75391: When the OTA entered the building
[20:00:02] CCA.C14-GRID.i3.36307: // the dehyrdration thing is annoying af
[20:00:13] CCA.C14-GRID.i3.36307: drop it
[20:00:14] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Fair, but at the moment I simply care about you.

[20:00:18] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Now then
[20:00:21] CCA.C14-UNION.i4.75391: Fair enough.
[20:01:20] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: You aren't union-washed, were found near a hostage situation in the same building and was being prioritized by other rogue units....and you said that you were grouping up with those very same rogue units...
[20:01:27] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Hm
[20:01:31] CCA.C14-GRID.i3.36307: // why does dehydration take down my armor lmao
[20:01:58] CCA.C14-UNION.i4.75391: Yes, but I already explained myself haven't I? You have no evidence to say I collaberated with their Rouge Agenda.
[20:02:06] CCA.C14-UNION.i4.75391: Because I hadn't.
[20:02:08] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: What an interesting situation, but I think getting a JUDGE unit to trial you would be better and closer to protocol.
[20:02:41] CCA.C14-UNION.i4.75391: You may get JUDGE, but he will turn me innocent, I already explained what had happened.
[20:02:52] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Hm...

[20:04:13] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Not much
[20:04:23] CCA.C14-UNION.i4.75391: You missed me telling the EpU I am innocent and giving him evidence.
[20:04:26] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Just gonna get a JUDGE unit to give his opinion
[20:04:36] CCA.C14-GRID.i3.36307: wasn't asking you
[20:04:36] Khillari Klinton: // so about that food i was gonna get

[20:05:53] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: I would like to take you innocent, but you getting prioritized by rogue units is really suspicious
[20:05:53] CCA.C14-GRID.i3.36307: .// that should be enough
[20:05:55] CCA.C14-UNION.i4.75391: Maybe. But I already showed I am innocent.

[20:06:14] CCA.C14-UNION.i4.75391: I already told you, they are smart enough to know 9mm doesnt work on a OTA.

[20:06:55] CCA.C14-UNION.i4.75391: // ee

[20:07:57] CCA.C14-UNION.i4.75391: They were rouge already, and you saw before that even still rouge units who were not suspected still shot at CCA on the streets. It is clear they were just trying to cause as much damage as they could.

[20:10:45] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: Fair, but are you saying that they would sacrifice themselved to just kill off some random i4 when he was being escorted by an ECHO.OSS? for rogue units attempting to do a lot of damage that seems pretty fucking stupid
[20:10:53] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: .// Themselves*
[20:11:19] CCA.C14-UNION.EpU.72633: It was an unequal sacrifice, they are smart enough to not do such a thing
[20:11:25] CCA.C14-UNION.i4.75391: CCA also shot at OTA in the streets, that was stupid of them too.
[20:11:28] Khillari Klinton: // dude im seeing shit
