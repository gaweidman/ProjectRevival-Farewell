[15:24:01] Finan O'Conall: // Fair I wasn't sure the age level of most players
[15:24:14] Jonathan Jackson: // Not really sure but with college it is still an issue
[15:24:36] Finan O'Conall: // College takes a LOT of effort so I can level with Q and the rest.
[15:24:48] Jonathan Jackson: // Yep
[15:24:56] Jonathan Jackson:  // Personally I think that Q just needs active staff
[15:25:10] Jonathan Jackson: // Personally I think that the server struggles because of inactive staff
[15:25:24] Jonathan Jackson: // When's the last time Ollie was on? DRD rarely gets on

[15:25:57] Finan O'Conall: // I've told Q this on multiple occassions. More people would get on if he gave out power and let more active members work
[15:26:38] Jonathan Jackson: // I remember back before the relaunch that I had been a staff member with Ollie and we would get on consistently and we would have like around 10 people on daily at minimum
[15:27:10] Finan O'Conall: // If you used to be staff Q should make you staff
[15:27:50] Jonathan Jackson: // I quit being a staff member due to an arguement with Q a while ago, its settled now and he apologized but I don't really know if I'd want to go back to it
[15:28:51] Finan O'Conall: // Someones gotta try to save us
[15:29:22] Jonathan Jackson: // Eh it can be anyone that's active and wants to become staff
[15:29:31] Finan O'Conall was killed by npc_zombine
[15:29:50] Jonathan Jackson: // Q often gets on by himself but doesn't really make any work cycles or any RP like that, that stuff is how people like do stuff
[15:30:08] Finan O'Conall: // The problem is that is you and I and maybe a few others and I'm definently not gonna do it.
[15:31:02] Jonathan Jackson: // Exactly, I think Q needs to consider removing Ollie from staff at this point, I like Ollie but I literally haven't even seen him talk
[15:31:32] Finan O'Conall: // I tried to tell Q to make changes he didn't wanna listen
[15:31:48] Finan O'Conall: // His server though
[15:32:15] Jonathan Jackson: // His anxiety probably, he never had that before though, he was fine and always in a VC beforehand, dunno what changed
[15:32:51] Finan O'Conall: // we seems worried often
[15:32:54] Finan O'Conall: // he*
[15:33:07] Jonathan Jackson: // He is isn't he?
[15:34:36] Jonathan Jackson: // I try to get him to add in these NPCs that he already said he wants in like multiple times but he kinda just ignores me, like putting it off
[15:34:37] Finan O'Conall: // Very anxious
[15:34:54] Finan O'Conall: // Maybe he's just really busy?
[15:35:04] Jonathan Jackson: // He made a vending machine
[15:35:12] Jonathan Jackson: // It's not hard to add an addon
[15:35:16] Finan O'Conall: // Or is it a- That is true.. that probably took longer.
[15:35:34] Jonathan Jackson: // He also didn't want to add the community TFA base for the HL:A weapons
[15:37:21] Jonathan Jackson: // Back then he focused on RP a lot and making sure people were having a good time now it feels like he doesn't like, add much
[15:37:41] Jonathan Jackson: // Then again that could be a staff issue too
[15:37:53] Finan O'Conall: // I think he wants a ton of content on the server but he needs to establish a playerbase first lol
[15:38:41] Jonathan Jackson: // Exactly, and the only way he can do that is by introducing RP and getting reasons for people to get on
[15:39:34] Jonathan Jackson: // Doesn't even want to ping people more than twice for a event when he literally makes a role on discord for notifications
[15:39:36] Finan O'Conall: // Things do need to change if tis wants to be more successful I just hope he sees it
[15:39:51] Jonathan Jackson: // I'll have to attempt to talk to him about it
[15:39:59] Jonathan Jackson: // Maybe I can talk some sense into him
[15:40:00] Finan O'Conall: // Please I back you
[15:40:20] Jonathan Jackson: // He might not want to listen but at that point I tried

[15:52:55] Jonathan Jackson: // I also used to be struggling for credits to make ends meet because I had to buy food and water and a respirator but now that I do have Credits I can't see what to use them for
[15:53:13] Jonathan Jackson: // No shops are ever open besides mine and the best thing you can buy is a Respirator
