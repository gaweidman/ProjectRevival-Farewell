[19:42:12] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Name?
[19:42:21] Henry Blackwoods: Henry Blackwoods, Officer.
[19:42:29] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: /looc Reveal yourself btw
[19:42:41] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: /looc Okay

[19:43:18] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Alright, lets start.
[19:43:43] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Now, why were you in the Sewer system?
[19:43:54] Henry Blackwoods: I'm gonna be honest with you here.
[19:44:00] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: You should be.
[19:44:44] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: /viewdata henry
[19:44:51] Henry Blackwoods: I opted to stay in the sewers for a more peaceful life, than live out here with the erm.. "Bad guys" and be oppresed, beaten up and stuff.
[19:45:15] Henry Blackwoods: I think you get the point.
[19:45:18] Henry Blackwoods: Right?
[19:45:22] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Hm
[19:45:31] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Was that your only intention?
[19:45:44] Alex Palovichov: Did I leave my oven...on....Ah shit!
[19:45:53] Henry Blackwoods: Well yeah, though of course I met some people.
[19:46:00] Henry Blackwoods: Well actually, 1.
[19:46:02] Henry Blackwoods: He is dead now.
[19:46:34] Henry Blackwoods: I didn't intend to resist or do anything harmful to others, my intention was simple, a peaceful life.
[19:47:06] Henry Blackwoods: Well, of course I acted like a rebel because how else would you act upon a gun to your head.
[19:47:16] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Reasonably.
[19:48:12] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: We have you on record stating to the man fighting one of our OTA stating quote, 'Beat his ass' and 'Kill him'"
[19:48:25] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Explain.
[19:48:26] Henry Blackwoods: Yeah, that's true.
[19:48:55] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: /looc hold on one sec after you type this, I forgor to record this
[19:49:10] Dropped "CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874" from server<STEAM_0:0:68118061>

[19:55:17] Henry Blackwoods: /looc alright.
[19:55:30] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: /looc Continue
[19:55:38] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: /looc Actually I'll restate
[19:56:51] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: You were found on record to have stated while the OTA officer was attacked by another man, quote "Beat his ass" and "Kill him" to the man fighting the OTA.
[19:56:55] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Explain.
[19:57:02] Henry Blackwoods: Yeah, that's true.
[19:57:49] Henry Blackwoods: Yet, I couldn't think straight even if I tried. Guns were blazing, blood was splattered. Even so, the OTA aimed his weapon at my head, I thought he would kill me.
[19:58:25] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: If they wanted to kill you they would have shot you on sight. Excuses doesn't make saying this any more justifiable.
[19:58:42] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Anyone in their right mind would have complied if they were just wanting to lead a 'peaceful life'.
[19:59:10] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Yet you had directly stated a thread to the OTA instead of doing just that, even supporting them being killed.
[19:59:20] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: /looc threat*
[19:59:44] Henry Blackwoods: Well, I had an axe on me, that's 1 reason that he could've killed me if he found out.
[20:00:14] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: We recovered the Axe yet during detainment there was no indication you would be using it.
[20:00:33] Alex Palovichov suicided!
[20:00:33] Alex Palovichov slayed Themself
[20:01:13] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: The only concern rose after these threats, where there was reasonable suspicion due to them being levied, therefor acting as having an axe while you had your arms tied and complying is absurd.
[20:01:39] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: The only reason you would be shot is if you were partaking in Anti-Civil activities
[20:01:48] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Which leads me onto my next question.
[20:02:26] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: The man you were found with was a Rebel conspirator, who had previously done acts to endanger the lives of both Citizens and CCA officals.
[20:02:52] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: It is reasonable to presume in your position that you were good friends, yet you also likely knew of the extent of his work.
[20:03:03] Henry Blackwoods: Ah.
[20:03:14] Henry Blackwoods: Yeah, I knew his work. He was enthuastic about it.
[20:03:29] Henry Blackwoods: Though I did not wish to participate in his work.
[20:03:48] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: I'm not asking that.
[20:03:57] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Let me rephrase into a question.
[20:04:16] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Explain your relationship and to the extent of the activites you know he did.
[20:04:41] Henry Blackwoods: Well, I do not know too much, but he had another friend.
[20:04:48] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Name?
[20:04:57] Henry Blackwoods: He is dead, I did not see the day to meet him.
[20:05:02] Alex Palovichov: /request Found some...Anti-Civil Propoganda, by someone called...The Doctor? I'm at the Plaza...
[20:05:18] Henry Blackwoods: The Doctor...

[20:05:49] Alex Palovichov: Oh right...Here
[20:05:50] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Hand over the paper.
[20:05:52] Henry Blackwoods: I'm sorry, pal'.
[20:05:57] Alex Palovichov: /me Would reach into his pocket, sliding a piece of paper over
[20:06:03] Alex Palovichov: Found it in the alleyway...
[20:06:19] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: I'm sure. I'll process your LP in a moment, I am busy.
[20:06:22] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Come back later.
[20:06:25] Henry Blackwoods: I am really sorry, if I hadn't have gone in the sewers in the first place.. you wouldn't have ended up dead.
[20:06:28] Alex Palovichov: Oh...uhh yeah sure...
[20:06:51] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: *ahem*
[20:07:00] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Read this
[20:07:05] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: And explain what you know.
[20:07:07] Henry Blackwoods: /looc Can't read it.

[20:07:30] Henry Blackwoods: Ah..
[20:07:45] Henry Blackwoods: He was a spark in the ashes.
[20:07:53] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Now, I don't think you are a stupid man.
[20:07:58] Henry Blackwoods: The doctor.
[20:08:00] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Quite the opposite.
[20:08:00] Henry Blackwoods: Is dead.
[20:08:54] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: You stated you knowingly knew the actions that this man had commited against the CCA.
[20:09:19] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: You of all people and I mean this as a compliment would know when to back out of a bad situation.
[20:09:28] Henry Blackwoods: Now, now.
[20:09:32] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: For instance, you ran away when you had the oppertun-
[20:09:34] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Shush
[20:09:38] Henry Blackwoods: /me Sighed
[20:10:07] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: You ran away when you had the oppertunity to while our OTA's back was turned and if you hadn't ran towards the elevator you might've gotten away.
[20:10:46] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: So I don't doubt you recognize the actions this person had done right? No if you didn't want to get involved, why did you even get involved with the "Doctor"
[20:11:09] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Surely you would know even in the sewers what is going too far.
[20:11:37] Henry Blackwoods: Like I said, I wanted a peaceful life, and the doctor came to me, yet when I first met him, I didn't know his work.
[20:11:46] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: I don't refute that
[20:11:56] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Yet I do know at some point you realized the extent of it
[20:12:22] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: And you willingly still were around him.
[20:12:37] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: This isn't a good look, even if you had the best intentions in mind.
[20:12:43] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: And you recognize that.
[20:12:50] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: So I'm giving you an offer.
[20:13:16] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: You tell us everything you know about these activities, and it's like water under the bridge.
[20:13:30] Henry Blackwoods: Hmm, well like I said, I don't know much
[20:13:41] Henry Blackwoods: Nor did he do anything major, atleast to my knowledge.
[20:13:56] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Mhm.
[20:14:10] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: We'll move on.
[20:14:35] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: Now, explain to me the items you had on you at the time of your detainment.
[20:14:45] Henry Blackwoods: Ah, yes.
[20:14:48] Henry Blackwoods: Well to begin.
[20:15:24] Henry Blackwoods: The axe was simply a weapon of self-defense against crazy geezers and xen lifeforms who want to kill me.
[20:15:31] Alex Palovichov: /request Wait...I may have some...info about the "Doctor" I remember being told something about him...
[20:15:45] Henry Blackwoods: The rest..
[20:15:51] Alex Palovichov: /request I'll be at the Work Desk...
[20:16:02] CCA.C17-HELIX.i4.08874: /pm alex Acknowleged
[20:16:20] Henry Blackwoods: The rest was just salvaged junk, found in the sewers. I thought it could make my life much easier against those hostiles.
