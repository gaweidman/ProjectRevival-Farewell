[14:51:24] Daniel J. Cutter: And...here's a tip...Don't stay in CZ for long...
[14:51:32] Daniel J. Cutter: He likes to hang around and catch people
[14:51:37] Daniel J. Cutter: Another thing
[14:51:44] Daniel J. Cutter: /me Would lean up to the man
[14:51:50] Daniel J. Cutter: /w Stay out of Shell Beach...
[14:51:50] Elias Hussein: hm?
[14:51:55] Daniel J. Cutter: /w Antlions will rip you to pieces
[14:52:08] Daniel J. Cutter: /me Would step back, patting the man on the arm
[14:52:08] Elias Hussein: anything else out ther I'd have to look out for?
[14:52:13] Daniel J. Cutter: Well...
[14:52:19] Daniel J. Cutter: Zombies, Headcrabs, CPs...
[14:52:29] Daniel J. Cutter: But down here...Most problem is the zombies and headcrabs...
[14:52:34] Raul Fernandez: Look out below boys! Oh shit!
[14:52:35] Daniel J. Cutter: Fuckers come out of nowhere
[14:52:40] Daniel J. Cutter: Ey!
[14:52:42] Raul Fernandez: Ah, heavy things.
[14:52:43] Daniel J. Cutter: Watch it!
[14:52:52] Raul Fernandez: My bad! Think I could come and get my entire car battery?
[14:52:59] Daniel J. Cutter: Go ahead!
[14:53:01] Elias Hussein: you carry a car battery throug ha sewer system? They're like thirty pounds.
[14:53:03] Daniel J. Cutter: Try not to hit me though!
[14:53:11] Raul Fernandez: I got more than just that one, buster.
[14:53:20] Daniel J. Cutter: Why the hell do you carry around car batteries?
[14:53:32] Raul Fernandez: Clearly they would be very high demand and lucrative items, no?
[14:53:42] Daniel J. Cutter: I doubt anyone could use them...
[14:53:49] Elias Hussein: I have some items of interest, if you're tech savy enough could possibly make a radio
[14:53:51] Raul Fernandez: A doubter? Hmmph.
[14:53:57] Elias Hussein: /me drops a couple items onto the floor
[14:54:00] Daniel J. Cutter: Ey! I ain't doubting you...
[14:54:07] Daniel J. Cutter: Mmm...
[14:54:13] Daniel J. Cutter: That circuit board could be useful...
[14:54:14] Raul Fernandez: These exact pieces I found upstairs not just a minute ago.
[14:54:16] Daniel J. Cutter: If you know how to use it
[14:54:31] Raul Fernandez: These sewers are full of useful junk, ain't they? Unfortunately, I am not able to produce  these things. I think.
[14:54:41] Daniel J. Cutter: Of course it is!
[14:54:48] Daniel J. Cutter: But...I already told this dude...
[14:54:51] Elias Hussein: im pretty bright myself but I dont have use for a radio.
[14:54:54] Daniel J. Cutter: You want alot of good shit...
[14:55:11] Daniel J. Cutter: Try break into the Orange suits office...Metropol Floor 2...
[14:55:21] Daniel J. Cutter: ICT Manager...Has a fuck ton of food, tools, water...
[14:55:25] Daniel J. Cutter: Everything you could need
[14:55:29] Daniel J. Cutter: But it ain't easy...
[14:55:31] Raul Fernandez: And how do you propose we do that?
[14:55:38] Elias Hussein: might be able to fart around the sewers for something that'll break in
[14:55:41] Daniel J. Cutter: Last I tried...I got shot...
[14:55:54] Daniel J. Cutter: Though...Thats cause I was stupid...
[14:55:55] Raul Fernandez: Hmm. Alright, well, you clearly ain't partner'd up with Raul Fernandez.
[14:56:00] Elias Hussein: Help break in I meant to say
[14:56:03] Raul Fernandez: /me would extend out a hand, walking over to the man. "That's me."
[14:56:04] Daniel J. Cutter: His windows are barred...and has a biolocked door...
[14:56:16] Daniel J. Cutter: Well...good to meet you Raul Fernandez...
[14:56:25] Daniel J. Cutter: /me Would extend his hand, shaking Raul's hand
[14:56:37] Daniel J. Cutter: You can just call me "Cutter"
[14:56:39] Raul Fernandez: Alright. I'm down to make  a plan to bust into  this place.
[14:56:45] Raul Fernandez: Cutter, eh? That based on your skills?
[14:56:48] Daniel J. Cutter: Best bet is through the door...
[14:56:55] Daniel J. Cutter: Those windows are layered with steel bars
[14:57:00] Raul Fernandez: Hmm. I see.
[14:57:04] Daniel J. Cutter: Though the door is biolocked...
[14:57:08] Raul Fernandez: Cop activity, how is it?
[14:57:23] Daniel J. Cutter: Don't ask me...If I'm caught up there, they'll be flooding the sewers with OTA...
[14:57:39] Raul Fernandez: Huh. Didn't realise you had so much heat on you.
[14:57:48] Daniel J. Cutter: Well...Come on, Look at me!
[14:57:51] Raul Fernandez: You still able to make a move if we make a plan?
[14:58:04] Elias Hussein: /me walks around thinking to himself
[14:58:06] Daniel J. Cutter: It'll have to be a quick apperance...
[14:58:13] Raul Fernandez: That's my speciality. Speed!
[14:58:20] Daniel J. Cutter: CPs catch on to me...or this operation, we're fucked
[14:58:34] Raul Fernandez: Alright. This place, where is it?
[14:58:35] Elias Hussein: /me picks up the shovel weilding it
[14:58:46] Daniel J. Cutter: Metropol...Across from the theatre...
[14:59:03] Raul Fernandez: Metropol. Potentially low cop activity there, I imagine.
[14:59:05] Daniel J. Cutter: You try enter through the roof, you'll probably get caught by him...
[14:59:08] Raul Fernandez: Low overall activity, honestly.
[14:59:12] Daniel J. Cutter: Meh...Its been increasing...
[14:59:24] Raul Fernandez: Alright, so. Which floor was it again?
[14:59:26] Daniel J. Cutter: Orange Suit...Alex...Is a high tier loyalist...ICT Manager
[14:59:32] Daniel J. Cutter: Second floor...
[14:59:41] Daniel J. Cutter: Best bet is to enter through street level...
[14:59:44] Daniel J. Cutter: Use the elevator up...
[14:59:46] Raul Fernandez: Second is pretty good.
[14:59:54] Elias Hussein: sounds good to me.
[14:59:56] Daniel J. Cutter: The roof would be too risky...
[14:59:58] Raul Fernandez: Right. But how  do we get in if it's biolocked? You got any tools for that?
[15:00:12] Daniel J. Cutter: Brute force...I don't have a EMP
[15:00:20] Daniel J. Cutter: Just anything to break it off...
[15:00:20] Raul Fernandez: Eesh. Door made of wood, could be doable.
[15:00:25] Daniel J. Cutter: Try that electric drill
[15:00:40] Daniel J. Cutter: It'll be loud...
[15:00:41] Elias Hussein: /me yawns
[15:00:42] Daniel J. Cutter: But could work
[15:00:44] Raul Fernandez: Hmm. Could technically cut at very slow speed.
[15:00:55] Elias Hussein: I'm getting tired here might just take a nap inside the cargo bin for safe keeping.
[15:01:03] Raul Fernandez: You sleep in cargo bins?
[15:01:08] Elias Hussein: I do now.

[15:01:35] Daniel J. Cutter: If you need me, I'll be at the cybercafe...
[15:01:41] Daniel J. Cutter: /y Good luck!

[18:59:18] Marckus Bates: in what way?
[18:59:31] Jonathan Jackson: Well, just asking if you need anything. You look roughed up.
[18:59:46] Marckus Bates: you know how to treat internal injuries?

[19:07:48] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: /me grabs the defibrillator, the man inspecting it. He would place the actual control and setting tablet onto the table and began to adjust the setting. He would then press the activation key onto the console before facing the dummy and rubbing the defibs together - <:: Clear.  ::>
[19:07:55] Marckus Bates: marckus

[19:09:27] Jonathan Jackson: I don't need much more than that, just a stable income is far enough for me.
[19:09:35] Marckus Bates: okay

[19:12:11] Jonathan Jackson: What's your opinion on our benefactors?
[19:12:31] Marckus Bates: none, I could give a lesser shit about the local politics
[19:12:40] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.00344: /me begins to remove the items one by one, although before doing this, he put on some medical gloves as to not taint the items in question. He would look back to the Officer - <:: I need a dummy for it. ::>
[19:12:41] Jonathan Jackson: /me shrugs.
[19:13:02] Jonathan Jackson: Everyone has got an opinion whether you like it or not, that's just how being subjugated is.
[19:13:14] CCA.C17-HELIX.OfC.01993: .//the dummy from the defib is still there

[20:10:51] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.01993: The number one thing to remember, 774, is that JUDGE units are not sociopaths. You'll be intimidating, effective, and cunning, but not deranged.

[20:31:23] Stewie Lou: one of the more simpler things made by combine

[20:33:11] Stewie Lou: yes
[20:33:48] Stewie Lou: also i feel like i've seen you before
[20:33:53] Stewie Lou: since my last visit
[20:34:01] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Well they're gone for now so anything you failed to mention that could be helpful, now would be the time. I'll get a kick in the rearend if I return with nothing and I'd not be very happy about that so please.

[20:35:09] Stewie Lou: they had a soft voice, and they were male for sure

[20:35:25] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Best guess.

[20:38:22] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Were they perhaps a local worker of the Grotto?
[20:38:30] Stewie Lou: im guessing
[20:38:54] Stewie Lou: since they had access to the kitchen, whatever it was behind the counter
[20:39:27] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Did they appear to have any other equipment on their person? Maybe a small radio looking device that they were checking the air with, or anything else?
[20:39:43] Stewie Lou: hmph
[20:40:14] Stewie Lou: i dont really know didn't get that much of a good look at their suit

[21:09:41] Andrew Cloverman: What Can I help you with?
[21:09:47] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: We need information relating to a certain business. Grizzly Grotto?
[21:09:55] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: The staff that work there.
[21:11:02] Andrew Cloverman: Yes, the bar down by the Diordna and the old corner shop?
[21:11:09] Andrew Cloverman: I've got their information on file.
[21:11:22] Andrew Cloverman: If you give me a second I can grab it for you.

[21:12:13] Andrew Cloverman: /me comes out holding a sheet of paper.
[21:12:24] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /me looks over the paper.
[21:12:32] Andrew Cloverman: Ryan Maylor and..

[21:12:43] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Jonathan Jackson, I can read it.

[21:12:52] Andrew Cloverman: .//thank you
[21:13:12] Andrew Cloverman: Not much. I deliver their shipments. The Grotto is in the slums, so it makes me nervous sometimes, but I haven't heard about any incidents going on over there.
[21:13:30] Andrew Cloverman: If anything is going on over there, I don't hear a thing about it
[21:13:34] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: I see.
[21:13:53] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Anything you can tell me about the two of them, I assume the CWU has records.
[21:14:24] Andrew Cloverman: I don't have access to their criminal records. The sheet there should have their CIDs on it if you want to look at their record.
[21:14:33] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: What's your affiliation with them? Friend or just coworker?
[21:14:38] Andrew Cloverman: I don't know much about them.
[21:14:43] Andrew Cloverman: /me looks toward the JUDGE unit.
[21:14:49] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Hm
[21:14:55] Andrew Cloverman: Coworker, officer.
[21:15:09] Andrew Cloverman: Like I said, I just work with paperwork and run their food shipments.
[21:15:26] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Alright, we won't bother you anymore. Thanks for your time.
[21:15:52] Andrew Cloverman<STEAM_0:1:53097688> changed their name to Ryan Maley
[21:15:53] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Alright, we got two suspects.
[21:16:14] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: If you can go grab them, we can deal with this Jonathan character first.
[21:16:28] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /pm ryan We are doing Jonathan first
[21:16:35] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: I've got to look over some notes in these files.
[21:16:36] Ryan Maley: /pm i3 alright
[21:16:51] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: You hear all that?
[21:16:55] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Kind of
[21:17:32] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Trying to decide whether we should handle this today or give it a day to fester. I might go in and aquaint myself with these individuals just to start.
[21:17:52] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Best to get it done now, while we got the time.
[21:18:00] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /looc Everyone needed is here, so might as well
[21:18:25] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: CID says that Jonathan lives at Manufacturing 1B, check that out.
[21:18:33] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Alright
[21:18:47] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: I'm going to talk some more with the head honcho here.
[21:18:47] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: I'll jump on that.
[21:18:59] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874<STEAM_0:0:68118061> changed their name to Jonathan Jackson
[21:19:58] Jonathan Jackson: /pm Ryan you can flag off till we need you, unless you want to stay on.
[21:20:11] Ryan Maley: /pm jon are you interrogating
[21:20:13] Jonathan Jackson: /me sighs

[21:20:46] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: /me knocks on the door to the apartment with the end of her stunstick creating a fairly loud *bang bang bang* against the feeble wood.
[21:21:17] Jonathan Jackson: /y Who is it? Marti it better not be you again or so help me god I'll call the CPs over.
[21:21:42] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: /me knocks twice more seemingly a bit more aggressive.
[21:22:28] Jonathan Jackson: /y For fucks sake Marti I'm telling you, go away. You already broke my god damn door. And I swear if you hit your crowbar again.
[21:23:00] Jonathan Jackson: /y Maybe if you didn't think that property damage was so funny.
[21:23:18] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: /me hits the door three more times remaining moderately silent, though the sounds of large boots against the floor could give the illusion of a units presence.
[21:23:43] Jonathan Jackson: /y Marti I'm coming out and I swear if I see you out there you better start running.
[21:23:54] Jonathan Jackson: /me squints their eyes.
[21:23:56] Jonathan Jackson: You.
[21:24:03] Jonathan Jackson: What.
[21:24:10] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: May I come in?
[21:24:20] Jonathan Jackson: If you promise not to beat me to the floor again.
[21:24:28] Jonathan Jackson: I had my fill of that.
[21:24:30] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Hopefully it won't have to come to that.
[21:24:36] Jonathan Jackson: Fine, whatever.
[21:24:40] Jonathan Jackson: /me sighs loudly.
[21:24:55] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: /me closes and relocks the door behind themself.
[21:25:06] Ryan Maley: //i lovet owtach sotuh park

[21:25:47] Ryan Maley: //so i'vebene on a south park kick. especially since i got covid
[21:25:51] Jonathan Jackson: I don't really feel like it. Unless you are here to interrogate me again.
[21:26:01] Ryan Maley: //it wasn't super popular but the denmark season was really good
[21:26:06] Ryan Maley: //at least in my opinion
[21:26:11] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Just a few questions this time.
[21:26:16] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Please, have a seat.
[21:26:18] Jonathan Jackson: Christ I knew it.
[21:26:29] Jonathan Jackson: /me sits down on the couch.
[21:26:31] Ryan Maley: //what i love the most though is now that i'm an adult, i can watch all the episodes i wasn't allowed to wtach befroe
[21:26:41] Jonathan Jackson: What did Alex do this time that warrants this?
[21:26:54] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: /me examines the room as she strolls about. She acknowledges the horse statues.
[21:27:10] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Fan of architecture?
[21:27:16] Jonathan Jackson: It's a hobby.
[21:27:21] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Hm
[21:27:39] Ryan Maley: //back when i was 12
[21:27:59] Jonathan Jackson: // I watched them a lot when I was younger.
[21:28:12] Ryan Maley: //me too but my dad would always skip the ones he knew were appropriate
[21:28:17] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: We were curious about your affiliation with Stewie Lou, does that name ring any bells?
[21:28:39] Jonathan Jackson: It sounds familiar.
[21:28:46] Jonathan Jackson: /me ponders for a moment.
[21:28:49] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: He's a short fellow.
[21:28:53] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Asian.
[21:29:02] Jonathan Jackson: I know, I had him as a customer.
[21:29:10] Jonathan Jackson: I don't think I got anything for you.
[21:29:23] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: How about this Marti Fellow?
[21:29:29] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Who is he to you?
[21:29:54] Jonathan Jackson: A dumbass, he broke my door a while ago with his crowbar, I'm sure you saw the door was splintered.
[21:30:07] Jonathan Jackson: /me mutters under his breath, "Asshat."
[21:30:07] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: It was quite weathered no doubt.
[21:30:27] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: So you wish for me to believe that-
[21:30:50] Jonathan Jackson: Believe what? That this is a waste of both your time and mine?
[21:31:07] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: /me picks up one of the horse statues examining it closely. She turns her head on a dime. "That you know nothing else about Stewie Lou?"
[21:31:24] Jonathan Jackson: I don't he was a one time customer.
[21:31:35] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Only once?
[21:31:45] Jonathan Jackson: That's the only time I saw them.
[21:32:15] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: /me places the horse statue down onto the shelf. She turns. "What about Ryan Maley? Where can I locate them?"
[21:32:30] Jonathan Jackson: Usually here, I live with them.
[21:32:48] Jonathan Jackson: Other than that, don't ask me, maybe he's at the Grotto but knowing him I doubt it.
[21:33:02] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: You are the owner of the Grotto correct?
[21:33:09] Jonathan Jackson: /me sighs.
[21:33:19] Jonathan Jackson: Yes I'm the owner.
[21:33:31] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: What sort of uniform do you outfit your workers with?
[21:33:44] Jonathan Jackson: /me gets up off the couch.
[21:34:02] Jonathan Jackson: /me unlocks the crate infront of him, and then opens it.
[21:34:22] Jonathan Jackson: Standard stuff, you've seen it a million times.
[21:34:39] Jonathan Jackson: Nobody uses the work suits in this profession, even if we are given them.
[21:34:44] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Does anyone around the Grotto wear perhaps a hazmat look suit?
[21:34:48] Ryan Maley: //you knovv vvhat's a bad sign
[21:35:21] Jonathan Jackson: Only me and Ryan work there and nobody wears that thing, other than when he's off doing whatever.
[21:35:34] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Off doing whatever..
[21:35:44] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: That sounds like you know something I don't.
[21:35:48] Ryan Maley: //thinking to ymself
[21:35:49] Ryan Maley: //"man"
[21:35:53] Ryan Maley: //"willard soudns fun right now"

[21:36:00] Jonathan Jackson: If I did you'd better remind me.
[21:36:05] Jonathan Jackson: /me grins and leans back.
[21:36:08] Jonathan Jackson: No I don't.
[21:36:10] Ryan Maley: //i'm not joking

[21:36:37] Ryan Maley: /toggleraise
[21:37:04] Jonathan Jackson: Good, because I don't want a repeat of last time, and I'm sure you got an earful from your supperiors about it too.
[21:37:25] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Hardly a slap on the wrist, but- you wouldn't even need to know.
[21:37:38] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: I appreciate you taking the time out of your day. Glory.
[21:37:43] Jonathan Jackson: Whatever
[21:38:16] Jonathan Jackson<STEAM_0:0:68118061> changed their name to CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874
[21:38:24] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /radio Done here, you get anything?

[21:43:42] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: So- I saw that you were wearing a lovely UU sponsered chemical suit.
[21:43:50] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /me takes out a small PDA, and types in the name of the CWU Worker infront of him.

[21:44:27] Ryan Maley: /me takes out the suit and turns around, stepping into it and zipping it up, then putting on the headpiece.
[21:44:44] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Hm

[21:45:09] Ryan Maley: /me doesn't respond, not wanting to talk out of turn.
[21:45:20] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Mr. Maley just out of curiousity have you had a run in with one Stewie Lou?
[21:45:49] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Try to remember to the best of your ability.
[21:46:24] Ryan Maley: I don't know the name, do you have a description? Physical, or his voice, or his personality..
[21:46:46] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Around 5'6 in height, stout asian fellow.
[21:46:56] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Wears a green suit.
[21:47:03] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: You guessed it.
[21:47:05] Ryan Maley: Did you see what he had on below it by any chance?
[21:47:19] Ryan Maley: I had someone fitting that description come in wearing a black and red jacket
[21:47:41] Ryan Maley: He ordered a slice of pumpkin pie. He, uh.. 
[21:47:44] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: I'd assume that someone befitting the status of a lowly citizen would constantly be in their green suit n-

[21:48:18] Ryan Maley: He took it off to eat, with the air vents around here.
[21:48:38] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Did he seem odd at all? Like he was up to no good?
[21:49:12] Ryan Maley: He made a strange... ¿joke? 
[21:49:19] Ryan Maley: Right, so.
[21:49:26] Ryan Maley: I had a run in with him in the plaza.
[21:49:34] Ryan Maley: He was at the work desk, I wanted to get some work, he was waiting for somebody.
[21:49:43] Ryan Maley: I said, "nobody on duty here?"
[21:49:56] Ryan Maley: I can't remember exactly what he said but it was something to the effect of "no"
[21:50:11] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Alright
[21:50:19] Ryan Maley: Sorry, I figure you want the full story.
[21:50:20] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: That before or after he got the pie?
[21:50:24] Ryan Maley: This is before.
[21:50:36] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Do me a favor and make yourself comfortable. I'd like to consult with my comrade.
[21:50:42] Ryan Maley: I said "oh, alright. I'm going to open up the grizzly grotto", told him where it was-
[21:51:02] Ryan Maley: For sure. Just to be clear, he did make a threatening.. statement? joke? And mentioned something of dubious legality to me
[21:51:09] Ryan Maley: Just to make that clear.
[21:51:10] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Understood
[21:51:15] Ryan Maley: I'll be here whenever you need me.
[21:51:18] Ryan Maley: /me sits down on the bench.
[21:51:25] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Story matches up so far.
[21:51:40] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: /w I believe this is our guy without a shadow of a doubt.
[21:52:02] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Psh, already knew that from what he said, he's somehow involved.
[21:52:37] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Let me go talk for a bit, then I'll make an excuse to step out. You take lead and put on some pressure. Doesn't have that backbone it seems.
[21:52:59] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Got it?
[21:53:05] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Alright
[21:53:20] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Sorry for the wait.
[21:53:26] Ryan Maley: no worries.
[21:53:38] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /me sits down onto the seat, directly across from the man.
[21:53:56] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: So for the record, your name is..?
[21:54:01] Ryan Maley: Oh, sorry. Ryan Maley.
[21:54:06] Ryan Maley: 15642.
[21:54:14] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Gotcha, making sure.
[21:54:19] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Tell me a little about this place.
[21:54:36] Ryan Maley: Well, we're a local bar, obviously. 
[21:54:55] Ryan Maley: I wanted something to do to make money and have purpose, I met my business partner, Jonathan, and he felt the same way.
[21:55:03] Ryan Maley: We had seen this place going through the city and we liked the setyle.
[21:55:09] Ryan Maley: He's my roommate, that's how we met.
[21:55:34] Ryan Maley: We needed to go in business together to get the Grotto because it's so big, so we said "alright", and we co-run the place.
[21:55:48] Ryan Maley: I like the food end, he does the bartending and front of house end. Normally, at least.
[21:56:03] Ryan Maley: Although I do a lot of the number work, too.
[21:56:13] Ryan Maley: accounting and paperwork, things like that
[21:56:33] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: I get the picture, about this Jonathan character.. know anything bout him?
[21:57:12] Ryan Maley: He's an interesting guy. He's polite, good to be around, pleasant.
[21:57:18] Ryan Maley: We don't talk too much, we normally split up our shifts.
[21:57:23] Ryan Maley: So I work when he doesn't and vice versa.
[21:57:47] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Thought you said you both manage seperate parts, I assumed you worked the same shift
[21:58:10] Ryan Maley: Not really. I do a lot of the prep, the actual cooking.
[21:58:36] Ryan Maley: so, baking the pies, cleaning the kitchen, pre-boiling the pasta.
[21:58:46] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /me listens carefully and respectfully to what the man is saying, clearly paying attention.
[21:58:47] Ryan Maley: so when he's doing his work all he has to do is heat it up in the oven or in a pan
[21:59:20] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Off the books, he someone very fond of our line of work?
[21:59:22] Ryan Maley: I should say that I do the bartending and front of house, it's just not my favorite. I'm less of a people person
[21:59:32] Ryan Maley: I, erm...
[21:59:48] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Just between you and me, I like to get to know people.
[21:59:52] Ryan Maley: God, I have to be honest.
[22:00:04] Ryan Maley: He doesn't strike me as someone.. explicitly, like..
[22:00:05] Ryan Maley: hateful?
[22:00:15] Ryan Maley: Of the Combine or the CCA.
[22:00:19] Ryan Maley: But I wouldn't call him a loyalist.
[22:00:25] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /me leans in a bit, intruiged.
[22:00:30] Ryan Maley: You know what I mean?
[22:00:34] Ryan Maley: Like he doesn't oppose you guys.
[22:00:38] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: I get what you are putting out.
[22:00:52] Ryan Maley: He just isn't a big-time, armband-wearing, poster-putting-up loyalist.
[22:01:09] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Gotcha, any past incidents you know of?
[22:01:20] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Like, has he talked at all about anything that's happen to him.
[22:01:38] Ryan Maley: /me speaks unsurely, seemingly not sure of the answer.
[22:01:42] Ryan Maley: Not... to my knowledge.
[22:01:51] Ryan Maley: If he's had any past incidents, they're news to me
[22:01:53] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /me clasps his hands together on the table politely.
[22:02:12] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: I see, we'll move onto you then logically.
[22:02:17] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: What do you think of us?
[22:02:24] Ryan Maley: Man, that's..
[22:02:26] Ryan Maley: That's really direct.
[22:02:33] Ryan Maley: I don't dislike the Combine.
[22:02:35] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Heh, I can be.
[22:02:51] Ryan Maley: I think it's unrealistic to say "yeah, I hate the people running the planet, I oppose them in every way."
[22:02:57] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: \
[22:02:58] Ryan Maley: Like dude, they beat you, they control the Earth, chill
[22:03:12] Ryan Maley: They know how to get to you, maybe calm your jets.
[22:03:27] Ryan Maley: I can't say I like all the changes, but this is just how it is... you know?
[22:03:45] Ryan Maley: I like the guarantees of food with the rations, but I'm not sure I'm a fan of trading my freedom to run for it.
[22:03:51] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: You don't have to say any more if you aren't comfortable.
[22:04:20] Ryan Maley: That's really about it. I do what it takes to survive, and I'm a realist. I try not to focus on the negatives, because you guys are very obviously here to stay.
[22:04:33] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /me goes alert for a second before leaning over into his radio.
[22:04:44] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /radio 10-4, moving to your 10-20 standby.
[22:04:54] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Looks like duty calls, I'll be back.
[22:05:02] Ryan Maley: Gotcha, no worries.
[22:05:05] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /me gets off the seat.
[22:05:34] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /radio Knock em dead.
[22:05:40] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /radio Not literally.
[22:06:03] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Mr. Maley, what happened to our other friend?
[22:06:20] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Did he run off somewhere?
[22:06:20] Ryan Maley: Hm?
[22:06:26] Ryan Maley: Stewie, you mean?
[22:06:34] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: No no our friend the unit.
[22:06:49] Ryan Maley: Oh, he said that he had something to do, he responded to his radio.
[22:06:51] Ryan Maley: I figured it was you.
[22:06:56] Ryan Maley: Who radioed him.
[22:07:46] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: /me walks around the seat back and slips herself into the booth. She places her stunstick on the table, underneath the table her sidearm is drawn slowly and pointed towards the mans middle section. "No matter. I wanted to get to know you better to be frank."
[22:07:59] Ryan Maley: .//are you aware your gun is out
[22:08:11] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: .// yes
[22:08:16] Ryan Maley: .//gothca
[22:08:17] Ryan Maley: .//alos
[22:08:22] Ryan Maley: .//i think i feel my femoral artery
[22:08:29] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: .// about to burst
[22:08:40] Ryan Maley: .//like when you clamp the hose shut
[22:08:49] Ryan Maley: For sure, what can I tell you
[22:08:58] Ryan Maley: .//fuck yeah, the tourette's episode is on
[22:09:06] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Well- I was curious what your occupation was before the war?
[22:09:52] Ryan Maley: Oh, I was a steelworker.
[22:10:01] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: A steelworker really?
[22:10:18] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: There no way.
[22:10:19] Ryan Maley: Yes, I worked at a steel mill. Blue collar
[22:10:25] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: .// there's
[22:10:26] Ryan Maley: .//wait
[22:10:27] Ryan Maley: .//wait wiat wait
[22:10:32] Ryan Maley: .//can i change- my backstory
[22:10:36] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: .// you may
[22:10:40] Ryan Maley: .//i found something that better explains my character's strength and intelligence
[22:10:48] Ryan Maley: .//my strength is 8 which amkes sense for being a steelworker
[22:10:52] Ryan Maley: .//but my intelligence is 7
[22:10:58] Ryan Maley: I was a welder.
[22:11:11] Ryan Maley: .//not to say that steelworkers are dumb but you can be dumb and a good steelworker
[22:11:15] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: A welder aye? There's no way you were a welder.
[22:11:36] Ryan Maley: Yes, I grew up in rural Illinois. I grew up in trades and blue collar work.
[22:12:05] Ryan Maley: My first job was landscaping. Weedwhacking, mowing lawns, pulling out trees and bushes..
[22:12:12] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: /me leans forward slightly. The man may be able to notice a shift under the table a bit.
[22:12:24] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: I could've sworn you used to be an actor.
[22:12:33] Ryan Maley: I-I'm sorry?
[22:12:44] Ryan Maley: Are you... getting at something?
[22:13:29] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Your skills in persuasion and bringing false ideas to fruition is unmatched by most others that much I have noticed. You'd make for a terrific actor.
[22:13:50] Ryan Maley: Officer, what are you saying?
[22:14:08] Ryan Maley: What are you saying I'm.. not being truthful about? Or deceptive, or...
[22:14:59] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: You said and I quote, "I think it is unrealistic to say, yea, I hate the people running the planet."
[22:15:43] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: You then said "They beat you, they control Earth, chill."
[22:15:56] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: But what really makes me shudder is what you said next.
[22:16:32] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: You said, "I'm not sure I'm a fan of trading my freedom to run for it."
[22:17:07] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Now any normal unit would assume that you are just a regular individual who see's the crummy situation they're in and tries to make the most of it.
[22:17:32] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: But what I know that the last guy doesn't is that you can have your freedom without us knowing about it.
[22:17:59] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: You'd just have to live a nice simple secret double life. That's easy enough right?
[22:18:05] Ryan Maley: Run for it as in, like, run for fun. Like for exercise. Not run away from the Combine. I'm saying I'm not sure free food is a good trade for being able to go for a jog.
[22:18:14] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Not done yet.
[22:18:22] Ryan Maley: Sorry
[22:18:24] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Where was I?
[22:18:34] Ryan Maley: You were saying something about a secret.. double life?
[22:18:57] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Blah blah, anyways hats off to you for fooling the last unit but the game ends here. Boy I love playing games, but when it comes to work..
[22:18:58] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: // back
[22:19:06] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Things get a little more tense.
[22:19:09] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874<STEAM_0:0:68118061> changed their name to Jonathan Jackson
[22:19:35] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: /me unsafeties the weapon under the table audibly so that the man could understand the severity of the situation.
[22:20:00] Jonathan Jackson: Uhh
[22:20:11] Ryan Maley: /me 's eyes go wide.
[22:20:25] Jonathan Jackson: Should I go, orrr?
[22:20:27] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: /me looks back toward the door to see Johnathan. "Oh perfect timing Mr. Jackson."
[22:20:36] Jonathan Jackson: Not you again.
[22:20:42] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: No no please come have a seat. Right next to your comrade.
[22:20:51] Ryan Maley: /me scoots to the side.
[22:20:52] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: We were just talking.
[22:20:55] Jonathan Jackson: Is this mandatory, I'd rather not.
[22:21:00] Ryan Maley: bud.
[22:21:03] Ryan Maley: Trust me, you don't want to...
[22:21:04] Ryan Maley: To not
[22:21:04] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Come and sit down Jonathan.
[22:21:15] Jonathan Jackson: Gee, this is fun.
[22:21:31] Jonathan Jackson: I have to just be dragged into everyone's mess.
[22:21:47] Jonathan Jackson: /me begrudgingly sits down onto the seat beside Ryan.
[22:21:49] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: /me scoots to put her back to the wall. She kicks up her feet onto the table and leans back slightly keeping the gun under the table trained onto Ryan.
[22:22:10] Client "Bean" connected.
[22:22:10] Ryan Maley: .//are we assuming jonathan didn;t see it
[22:22:18] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: I was just saying how Mr. Maley here would make an excellent actor in the old war. Don't you agree.
[22:22:19] Jonathan Jackson: We having a suit conention or what?
[22:22:21] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: .// up to him
[22:22:24] Jonathan Jackson: /looc I didn't see anything.
[22:22:47] Jonathan Jackson: Depends if he has a bachelors degree.
[22:23:03] Jonathan Jackson: I didn't care to ask.
[22:23:05] Ryan Maley: /me stays completely silent.
[22:23:16] Client "Bean" spawned in server <STEAM_0:1:591779303> (took 66 seconds).
[22:23:20] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: /me looks to Ryan dartingly.
[22:23:30] Jonathan Jackson: /me leands forward on the table foldinding his hands neatly.
[22:23:37] Bean<STEAM_0:1:591779303> changed their name to Daniel J. Cutter
[22:23:37] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Agh! Lost my place in our conversation again.
[22:23:43] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Where were we this time?
[22:23:43] Ryan Maley: //the fucking ~~BOYS~~ PALS
[22:23:47] Ryan Maley: //wait nums what are yourpronouns
[22:23:49] Jonathan Jackson: You tell me 
[22:24:00] Jonathan Jackson: Since you can't seem to get enough of interrupting my life.
[22:24:03] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: // everyone assumes im male
[22:24:08] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: // So epic
[22:24:11] Jonathan Jackson: // boyz
[22:24:12] Ryan Maley: //i haven't assumed you're male
[22:24:17] Daniel J. Cutter: /looc May I take a seat?
[22:24:20] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: // I am not
[22:24:20] Ryan Maley: //because aepx called you she once
[22:24:27] Ryan Maley: //and i try not to assume anyways
[22:24:33] Jonathan Jackson: /looc feel free to observe
[22:24:36] Ryan Maley: //so, she/her, she/they..
[22:24:47] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: // she/her
[22:24:48] Ryan Maley: You were talking.. about.. secret life.. I think you were acc- you were talking about.. things like that?
[22:24:49] Ryan Maley: //gotcha
[22:24:52] Ryan Maley: //the fucking PALS
[22:24:55] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Oh right.
[22:25:19] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: You know it is easy to say that you wouldn't mind trading your freedom for a comfy little life.
[22:25:23] Jonathan Jackson: /me leans back and holds his hands behind his head relaxing, not really caring for the situation in general.
[22:25:41] Ryan Maley: /me was clearly going to say "accusing", but didn't want to anger the unit.
[22:25:43] Daniel J. Cutter<STEAM_0:1:591779303> changed their name to Alex Palovichov
[22:25:47] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Especially when one doesn't have to give up their freedom, when they can just y'know live two lives.
[22:25:52] Jonathan Jackson: Sure we've all heard nursery rimes, what's the point?
[22:26:06] Jonathan Jackson: Customer, if you would excuse me.
[22:26:10] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Great question Mr. Jackson!
[22:26:11] Jonathan Jackson: /me perks up at the noise.
[22:26:28] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Please go tend to your customer I'll continue with my associate.
[22:26:34] Alex Palovichov: /me Would lean up against the wall behind him, humming
[22:26:38] Jonathan Jackson: Mhm, you would like that.
[22:26:41] Jonathan Jackson: /me gets up.
[22:26:50] Ryan Maley: .//this is the equivalent of Just Some Guy walking into the vault cracking scene in Die Hard
[22:27:02] Jonathan Jackson: Don't let this person get to you Ryan, everyone's got supperiors.
[22:27:04] Jonathan Jackson: /me chuckles.
[22:27:06] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: You see that Mr. Maley?
[22:27:14] Alex Palovichov: Ah, Jonathan...
[22:27:20] Jonathan Jackson: How can I help you..
[22:27:24] Jonathan Jackson: /me squints at him.
[22:27:25] Alex Palovichov: Do you by chance sell...bred?
[22:27:28] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: How Mr. Jackson is openly defying? He isn't as smart as one would give him credit for.
[22:27:28] Alex Palovichov: /looc bread****
[22:27:34] Jonathan Jackson: No I don't breed dogs.
[22:27:40] Alex Palovichov: Huh?
[22:27:41] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Anyone could peg him for a miscreant.
[22:27:47] Alex Palovichov: Do you sell bread or not...
[22:27:50] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: But not you.. why is that?
[22:27:54] Jonathan Jackson: /y I heard that.
[22:27:59] Alex Palovichov: What?
[22:28:06] Ryan Maley: /w Because... you have a gun... to me..
[22:28:09] Ryan Maley: /w But... more realistically...
[22:28:12] Jonathan Jackson: I do, you want some? Standard UU issue.
[22:28:17] Alex Palovichov: Yes...
[22:28:19] Ryan Maley: /w I know how pointless it is to... resist.
[22:28:22] Alex Palovichov: How much each...
[22:28:25] Jonathan Jackson: And between you and me.
[22:28:29] Jonathan Jackson: /me leans forward
[22:28:35] Jonathan Jackson: /looc pretend leaning
[22:28:42] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: /w Then you know that the next answers to your questions will decide my judgement.
[22:28:51] Jonathan Jackson: /w We have a CP in the backroom interrogating the other guy who co-owns this place.
[22:29:02] Alex Palovichov: /me Slowly nods his head "I see..."
[22:29:08] Jonathan Jackson: Now, bread is three tokens each.
[22:29:15] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: /w Is Stewie Lou an anticitizen? Who spends time running amok in the sewer section and beyond?
[22:29:21] Alex Palovichov: Ah...Cheap...
[22:29:42] Jonathan Jackson: Eh, no need to charge that much, this aint Wiemar Germany.
[22:29:44] Alex Palovichov: I need a large amount...Will you be able to supply me nine?
[22:29:45] Ryan Maley: /w I'm genuinely not sure. Can I tell you about the threat he made to me?
[22:29:54] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: /w Go on..
[22:29:55] Ryan Maley: /w And what he said to me at the work desk?
[22:29:55] Jonathan Jackson: Sure thing, I believe we can spare.
[22:30:00] Alex Palovichov: Perfect...
[22:30:01] Ryan Maley: /w so, I'll get to the meat of it.
[22:30:03] Jonathan Jackson: Just a second, I'll get out some boxes.
[22:30:14] Alex Palovichov: /me Would reach into a bag taking out a large handfull of credits
[22:30:17] Ryan Maley: /w I told him I was opening the Grotto, he asked if I wanted to buy some scrap or an electric drill.
[22:30:18] Alex Palovichov: This should be enough
[22:30:26] Alex Palovichov: /droptokens 50

[22:31:29] Alex Palovichov: /me Would reach into a pocket taking out a single token, He'd then begin to flip it...An audible noise made with each flip echo's throughout the building
[22:31:30] Ryan Maley: /w I say no, and that electric drills are contraband.
[22:31:38] Ryan Maley: /w he's like 'ok man' and brushes it off
[22:31:50] Ryan Maley: /w so I just think 'whatever' to myself and go to the Grotto, open it up.
[22:31:56] Jonathan Jackson: /me takes out several boxes of bread from the Refridgerator, and carefully moves it over towards the door.
[22:31:57] Ryan Maley: /w He comes through eventually
[22:32:12] Ryan Maley: /w I get to him, I ask him what he wants

[22:32:49] Jonathan Jackson: /looc lol
[22:32:53] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: /w Where did he offer to sell you contraband?
[22:32:54] Ryan Maley: /w I say, 'hey, I hope you don't use that thing to rob us.'

[22:32:57] Ryan Maley: /w In front of the work desk.
[22:33:04] Ryan Maley: /w This was the first time I saw him.
[22:33:04] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: /w Very good.
[22:33:14] Alex Palovichov: /it The sound of a coin flipping can once again be heard, echoing throughout the building
[22:33:14] Ryan Maley: /w This next thing happened at the grotto.
[22:33:18] Ryan Maley: /w So I tell him that, I make that joke
[22:33:19] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Well Mr. Maley, I believe we are done here.
[22:33:24] Ryan Maley: /w And he says, seemingly dead serious, 'I might.'
[22:33:28] Jonathan Jackson: /me gets some more bread out, still packaged with a UU symbol on it.
[22:33:38] Ryan Maley: /w and I'm like 'hey, asshole. don't rob us. I was trying to be funny.'
[22:33:38] Jonathan Jackson: Oh good, the less time with you the better.
[22:33:52] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: /me slips their sidearm back into their holster after clicking on the safety. She grabs her stun baton and slides out of the booth mid conversation.
[22:34:03] Alex Palovichov: Perfect...
[22:34:06] Alex Palovichov: You're a life saver...
[22:34:07] Jonathan Jackson: That'll be all, want a drink to go with it?
[22:34:09] Ryan Maley: That was the last time I saw him.
[22:34:16] Alex Palovichov: Eh...Ya know, Just a beer will do
[22:34:23] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: I appreciate the information. We will more than likely be in touch soon to further our investigation, but for now here are a few rules.
[22:34:24] Jonathan Jackson: Sure thing, I'll get a cold one.
[22:34:32] Alex Palovichov: /me Chuckles "Please do..."
[22:34:44] Jonathan Jackson: /me grabs a cold beer out of the fridge, closing it behind him.
[22:34:45] Alex Palovichov: /it The sound of a coin flipping can once again be heard, echoing throughout the building
[22:34:59] Alex Palovichov: /me Catches the coin out of the air, putting it into his pocket
[22:35:02] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: The contents of this discussion will remain to this room only. Also don't run off anywhere because haha.. I love to play games and hide and go seek is one of my favorites.

[22:48:43] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Well from what I can understand we are in a catch twenty-two situation in which both of them could be lying.
[22:48:46] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: However
[22:49:50] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: I did get a piece of information that could tell us which one lied about that other. Apparently Ryan Maley says there was a confrontation in which Lou attempted to sell him contraband in front of the work desk. If we could access camera logs we could possibly pick this out and pin it onto Lou.
[22:50:10] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: I got no anti citizen vibe from Mr. Maley and I was giving him the business...
[22:50:35] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Above the books right? He was a technically a loyalist after all.
[22:51:03] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Above the books meaning?
[22:51:21] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Within reason, not really dealing with a malignant.

[22:52:22] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Tried my best.
[22:52:35] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: He seemed a bit afraid, you were right about the backbone comment.
[22:52:38] Daniel J. Cutter: /it The city seems calm, the normal noises of a industrial city being made...But something...strange can be heard...It echos throughout the city, You can only barely notice it

[22:52:57] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: This is some good info you got for us, I'm sure they were cooperative right?
[22:53:17] Ryan Maley to admins: greeting observer friend
