[20:47:50] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.83253: /chardesc 
[20:47:51] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: /me would grab the man by the arm and gently pull him away while still seeming somewhat urgent.

[20:48:35] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: /me would leave the man standing behind the table however she wouldn't remove his blindfold.
[20:48:44] Major-General Sir Issac Brock KB to admins: good god, lightroom did a ban
[20:48:50] Jonathan Jackson: Because I know what you did to him, using that gun just to intimidate the guy.

[20:48:57] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.83253 to admins: book time...
[20:48:58] Ephraim Harris to admins: i need to fix our old bans but i have no idea what they were for a lot of the time
[20:49:02] Jonathan Jackson: That's low, even for your standards.
[20:49:08] Ephraim Harris to admins: if you're not RPing as a unit pls flag down, it's bad for ratio
[20:49:16] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.83253 to admins: ah alrighty

[20:49:51] Ephraim Harris: /toggleraise
[20:49:53] Major-General Sir Issac Brock KB to admins: doesn't affect the ratio in either directions
[20:49:53] Jonathan Jackson: A loyalist shouldn't be treated the same as a, what do you call it? A "Malignant".
[20:50:00] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Why are we still getting reports from civillians all over the place that you are conspiring to commit anti civil activity in the community?
[20:50:15] Jonathan Jackson: Still? First time I'm hearing about it.
[20:50:25] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: I've brought this up to you before.
[20:50:35] Ephraim Harris to admins: still, it's better optics to be on a citizen for admin stuff
[20:50:35] Daniel J. Cutter: shit
[20:50:36] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Twice actually.
[20:50:43] Ephraim Harris to admins: i mean i'm not gonna flag it as a staff problem

[20:51:42] Daniel J. Cutter to admins: btw first person to ACTUALLY mug someone
[20:51:45] Ephraim Harris to admins: nice
[20:51:51] Jonathan Jackson: No you haven't, you interrogated me once about some guy name Alex and then you interrogated me again for some other guy I don't know about, even hiding a gun pointing at Ryan.
[20:51:56] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: /me pulls out their PDA and begins typing in new information. She sits quietly and does not respond to whatever the man said next.
[20:51:59] Daniel J. Cutter to admins: good ol' axe and 120 extra credits in my pocket
[20:52:01] Jonathan Jackson: I don't think we've talked about this before.
[20:52:18] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: /viewdata jackson
[20:52:30] Jonathan Jackson: Of course, you would rephrase it wouldn't you?

[20:53:43] Ephraim Harris: .//ahhhh
[20:54:03] Jonathan Jackson: Sounds like whoever got you this info thinks that I'm Anti-Civil because I work a job in the alleyway.
[20:54:09] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: /me pulls out her sidearm. Keeping it on safety she silently pretends like she is shooting the man. Of course his blindfold was still on his head so he couldn't see this.
[20:54:14] Ephraim Harris to admins: that's a really cool thing to do but i didn't describe myself slammingit. maybe avoid doing it in that vvay. try to avoid describing the player's actions, let them fill it in
[20:54:23] Major-General Sir Issac Brock KB to admins: q check dms
[20:54:23] Ephraim Harris to admins: try to avoid describign the player in general. that's their thing
[20:54:33] Daniel J. Cutter: /it The sound of something rolling across the concrete ground is heard echoing throughout the alleyway
[20:54:37] Jonathan Jackson: Shake your head all you want, I can hear you. Trust me, I don't want to deal with you either.
[20:54:39] Ephraim Harris to admins: describe the environment if you're going to do- exactly
[20:54:58] Jonathan Jackson: I'd rather have any other officer who actually respects me come talk to me about this.
[20:55:19] Ephraim Harris to admins: hey bean
[20:55:24] Daniel J. Cutter to admins: thats me
[20:55:24] Ephraim Harris to admins: don't open the imgur links in the ban reasons

[20:56:12] Daniel J. Cutter: Drop them...
[20:56:16] Jonathan Jackson: You find that funny? Because it's true. I won't forget about what you did when all you had to do was just ask me to come down for me to answer a few questions about Alex.
[20:56:19] Ephraim Harris: Dude.. come on..
[20:56:19] Daniel J. Cutter: Don't make me do anything we'll regret...
[20:56:23] Daniel J. Cutter: Don't...Please

[20:56:34] Daniel J. Cutter: Just...Give me the fucking credits...
[20:56:50] Daniel J. Cutter: /me Would tighten his grasp on his axe, seemingly becoming annoyed
[20:56:53] Ephraim Harris: Exactly. Don't come down on me, man. Come on.
[20:56:56] Daniel J. Cutter: Don't make me regret this...
[20:56:57] Ephraim Harris: Ugh. Fine.
[20:57:00] Ephraim Harris: Fine. Fine.
[20:57:11] Jonathan Jackson: Any other Officer would have been way kinder to me, and maybe not hit me with a stunstick and left me waking up infront of the Nexus with a burn mark.
[20:57:15] Daniel J. Cutter: Put them on the ground...And step back...
[20:57:29] Ephraim Harris: /me takes out a zipped bag of coins from his left pocket. He unzips it and pulls out three five-piece tokens.
[20:57:40] Major-General Sir Issac Brock KB<STEAM_0:0:193599766> changed their name to Paul-Henri Cartier
[20:57:40] Daniel J. Cutter: Put them on the ground...
[20:57:44] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: You know respect if given and earned. Walking past an officer and saying phrases like "Fuck you", "Forget to tell you this one has a temper", and actively trying to make my life a living hell.
[20:58:01] Ephraim Harris: /me places the tokens on the ground and zips the bag shut again.
[20:58:01] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: It makes resent individuals like you.

[20:58:31] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: But my personal feeling doesn't matter anymore to me you are just like everyone else. All of you are just another citizen I do not care.
[20:58:32] Daniel J. Cutter: Keep moving back...To that dumpster...

[20:59:25] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: However, I do care about the safety of the city and the people within it. When I'm constantly being bombarded with reports of citizens trying to defy a comfy lifestyle I get a little ticked and rightfully so.
[20:59:35] Ephraim Harris: /me takes the tokens and unzips his bag, putting them back in.
[20:59:48] Ephraim Harris: what the FUCk.

[21:00:09] Daniel J. Cutter: /me Would lock the door behind him
[21:00:10] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Because daily, nightly, 24/7, 365, I deal with bullshit from people like you. So I am sorry that I get bent out of shape when someone assumes they're better than me just because I chose a different kind of lifestyle then them.

[21:01:46] Paul-Henri Cartier: --I uh

[21:03:31] Ephraim Harris: look where that gets us
[21:03:35] Paul-Henri Cartier: i can see that
[21:03:36] Jonathan Jackson: Listen, maybe we got off on the wrong initial foot, and it spiraled downhill. That I will say. I will say this, I respect your proffession and what it does for the community, however my initial meeting with you has left a poor representation in my mind.
[21:03:38] Daniel J. Cutter: But...whatcha lookin' for?
[21:03:43] Paul-Henri Cartier: anything useful.
[21:03:47] Daniel J. Cutter: I have plenty of stuff...for a price...

[21:04:15] Daniel J. Cutter: Psh...They abandoned this place...a long time ago
[21:04:16] Jonathan Jackson: I think it is fair if we both apologize, I won't forget about it, but the least that can happen is a more mutal tolerance towards each other.

[21:06:01] Jonathan Jackson: I am sorry for my previous actions, I was rude, I will not say uncalled for but regardless I was rude during a professional setting, I was also uncooperative and disrespectful. For that I am deeply sorry.
[21:06:01] Daniel J. Cutter: Probably full if I were to guess
[21:06:04] Ephraim Harris: people are leaving this behind?
[21:06:05] Paul-Henri Cartier: I do not have an AR2, no. Those things are biolocked, too. As useful as a brick.

[21:22:46] Jonathan Jackson: Me and a guy name Alex have a long history, but to make it short, I used to hate his guts because I got interrogated because of him, now it looks like he just reported me to the CPs again.
[21:23:01] Ephraim Harris: Damn, sounds like an asshole.
[21:23:02] Jonathan Jackson: Said I was some Anti-Citizen just because I work a job in the Alleyway.
[21:23:10] Ephraim Harris: That's ridiculous.

[21:24:46] Ephraim Harris: He went into the corner restaurant or cafe, or whatever itwas.
[21:24:53] Ephraim Harris: I'm not sure where he went after that.
[21:25:02] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Alright
[21:25:13] Daniel J. Cutter: /it Another slam of something hitting a dumpster echo's throughout the alleyway

[21:25:42] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: We will make a note of it. In the meantime if you see anything else do not be afraid to report it and I'd advise only staying near populated areas if possible.
[21:26:04] Ephraim Harris: Yeah, I definitely learned that. Thanks.
[21:26:08] Jonathan Jackson: Something needs to be done for it, bad for business.
[21:26:15] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Trying our best.
[21:26:25] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: /me sighs. "Be safe now, glory.

[21:46:51] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /me lowers his jacket and shirt, then takes off the glove.
[21:46:59] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /me throws it away.
[21:47:02] Alex Palovichov: Psh...The most I have is the armed rebel I saw multiple times from my roof...But I'm guessing you guys know of that guy from the amount of times I've reported him
[21:47:10] Alex Palovichov: Never seen that guy though...
[21:47:14] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /me grabs another medical ice pack from a First Aid Kit and shakes it.
[21:47:29] Alex Palovichov: The last thing I think I remember him saying to me was... "The Baron sends his regards"
[21:47:36] Alex Palovichov: What ever the fuck that is...
[21:47:47] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Mhm

[21:49:05] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /me then starts taping around his waste, making sure it's secure.
[21:49:16] Alex Palovichov: /me Shivers a bit "Quite cold..."
[21:49:18] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: It'll be awkward, but it'll be held in place.
[21:49:23] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Better than not feeling anything
[21:49:31] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: We can rule out nervous damage.
[21:49:38] Ephraim Harris: FUCK YOU
[21:49:41] Alex Palovichov: Well...thats good
[21:50:06] Alex Palovichov: Never heard of this "Baron" before

[21:52:08] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /me grabs a medical chart from the cabinet.
[21:52:14] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: You don't allow yourself that.

[21:59:22] Alex Palovichov: I have some back at the office...
[21:59:27] Ephraim Harris: /me looks at the wood on the horses. He looks at how thick it is, and decides it's a good fit. 
[21:59:28] Alex Palovichov: /me Would stand up from the bed
[21:59:35] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Before you go, one piece of advice.
[21:59:39] Ephraim Harris: /me raises his axe and delivers a solid chop to the middle of one of the blanks.
[21:59:57] Ephraim Harris: /me then proceeds to write blocky letters into the wood with his axe. It takes time. And strength.
[22:00:10] Ephraim Harris: /rollattribute fabrication
[22:00:11] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: I'd reccomend you refrain from talking to anyone for a bit, lest this happen again.

[22:03:45] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: They're more than likely gone now.
[22:03:49] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: You know we can't go in there without permission.
[22:03:50] Daniel J. Cutter: Times are tough down here...
[22:03:55] Ephraim Harris: sorry doesn't give back my money, but I don't want to hold a grudge.
[22:04:02] Ephraim Harris: If you're not gonna mug me again, we're cool
[22:04:04] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: I only stepped into the CZ don't bite my head off.
[22:04:11] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Lest airwatch catch you.
[22:04:13] Daniel J. Cutter: I ain't man...I needed it for some food and water...
[22:04:25] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: How'd it go with the interrogation?
[22:04:26] Ephraim Harris: plus
[22:04:35] Ephraim Harris: you escaping with me and not throwing me under the bus was a pretty good gesture
[22:04:39] Ephraim Harris: I'm fine with calling it even.
[22:04:49] Daniel J. Cutter: I ain't the type to throw people to the CPs...
[22:04:59] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Well. If we hear another peep about Mr. Jackson being anti-civil then things will get a bit more serious.
[22:05:01] Daniel J. Cutter: Lets chat somewhere more...safe
[22:05:24] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: From what I saw from treating him, that Alex character is paranoid.
[22:05:37] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Indeed
[22:05:40] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Yet he didn't know it, but that confirmed my suspicions of him.
[22:05:44] Ephraim Harris: oh, that's your place?
[22:05:52] Daniel J. Cutter: /me Would reach into a small bag, taking out a pair of keys
[22:05:56] Daniel J. Cutter: You could call it that
[22:06:13] Daniel J. Cutter: /me Would insert the key into the lock, turning it and unlocking the door
[22:06:14] Ephraim Harris: small world, I was just back here exploring
[22:06:16] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: He self admitted to having at least contact with some Anti-Civil activities, stating that it was only brought upon him.
[22:06:23] Ephraim Harris: damn, you've got a setup here
[22:06:26] Daniel J. Cutter: /me Would lock the door behind him
[22:06:32] Daniel J. Cutter: Course I do...
[22:06:37] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: He had some level of contact with the 'Doctor' character who got killed by that OTA.
[22:06:46] Daniel J. Cutter: Waiting for a delivery anytime soon...Might as well be ready for it
[22:06:51] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Now someone named the "Baron"
[22:06:53] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: I'd say that's enough to dock him a level.
[22:06:56] Daniel J. Cutter: You hungry? Thirsty?
[22:07:00] Ephraim Harris: oh, no, thanks.
[22:07:02] Ephraim Harris: I appreciate it
[22:07:02] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: His loyalty status that is.
[22:07:12] Ephraim Harris: I get my food from the headcrabs
[22:07:17] Daniel J. Cutter: Say...what were you doin' up there anyway?
[22:07:23] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Doubt it, can't prove he wasn't just being threatened.
[22:07:28] Ephraim Harris: I was trying to find a place to camp out.
[22:07:35] Ephraim Harris: I've got a.. how do you put it..
[22:07:40] Daniel J. Cutter: /me Chuckles "Up there?! Hah!"
[22:07:41] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: He did state he saw that armored fellow before on the rooftops in here.
[22:07:45] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /me motions to the CZ.
[22:07:56] Ephraim Harris: I'm the self-appointed leader of.. a group. That I made
[22:08:00] Daniel J. Cutter: Thats the worse place to make a base camp! Orange suit would catch you...
[22:08:07] Ephraim Harris: You mean Alex?
[22:08:12] Daniel J. Cutter: Thats his name?
[22:08:14] Daniel J. Cutter: Sure
[22:08:14] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: My guess? He's somehow involved with the same guy he just got hit over the head by.
[22:08:24] Daniel J. Cutter: Then again, I think I taught em a lesson...
[22:08:31] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Or the same guy
[22:08:32] Daniel J. Cutter: Beat em up a bunch with a crowbar...
[22:08:39] Daniel J. Cutter: Well...I was told to of course...
[22:08:49] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Unlikely, considering the circumstances of the second attack.
[22:08:51] Daniel J. Cutter: The Baron" Doesn't fancy to loyalists
[22:08:59] Ephraim Harris: The Baron? That's a pretty good name.
[22:09:04] Daniel J. Cutter: Not my name...
[22:09:08] Ephraim Harris: No, I figured.
[22:09:09] Ephraim Harris: Still
[22:09:10] Daniel J. Cutter: People just call me Cutter...
[22:09:17] Daniel J. Cutter: The Baron" is my boss...
[22:09:19] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Apparently he had helped the guy after the robbery and escorted him to ICT Headquaters to keep em safe.
[22:09:20] Ephraim Harris: That's a pretty good name, at least.
[22:09:25] Ephraim Harris: Nickname, rather.
[22:09:25] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Even refunded him what was stolen.
[22:09:30] Daniel J. Cutter: I doubt anyone knows his real name...
[22:09:37] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Weird
[22:09:38] Daniel J. Cutter: I'm waiting on a delivery from him...
[22:09:48] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: We'll have to get airwatch to look into it.
[22:09:50] Ephraim Harris: mind if I ask what?
[22:09:51] Daniel J. Cutter: He lives in...well I can't say...
[22:10:05] Daniel J. Cutter: But he supplies me all sorts of shit...
[22:10:11] Daniel J. Cutter: Mostly parts n stuff 
[22:10:15] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Either that or somehow get some investigation going into the CZ, likely could get an OTA down there if need be.
[22:10:17] Ephraim Harris: oh, yeah? nice, nice
[22:10:24] Daniel J. Cutter: But, if I ask and pay enough, he can score me some high tier shit
[22:10:29] Ephraim Harris: What, do you tinker around? 
[22:10:33] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: There's enough cause for it, doubt Dispatch would let us in there.
[22:10:39] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: That would be very much needed.
[22:10:41] Ephraim Harris: Or is there something in particular you're trying to do?
[22:10:44] Daniel J. Cutter: Usually add radio's of sort...
[22:10:49] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: I'll see what I can do regarding it.
[22:10:50] Ephraim Harris: Oh, cool.
[22:10:55] Daniel J. Cutter: Help with the communication between stations...
[22:10:59] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: I'll let you know over Radio.
[22:11:00] Daniel J. Cutter: Though the radio I had broke...
[22:11:03] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Alright
[22:11:15] Daniel J. Cutter: So now I need to find another radio that I can mess around with...make it able to reach long range
[22:11:36] Ephraim Harris: gotcha, gotcha. The best way to do that for something like that, that kind of operation that you're.. implying.
[22:11:40] Daniel J. Cutter: Though, until that happens...I have to communicate with him from a...certain person
[22:11:41] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874 to admins: Q you here?

[22:12:22] Ephraim Harris: Right, I remember.

[22:12:33] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /pm eph We probably need permission from Dispatch to move into the CZ/Sewers, or at least get an OTA in there, due to the attacks that is warranting it.
[22:12:41] Ephraim Harris: /pm helix what were the attacks

[22:15:02] Daniel J. Cutter: They have this place locked down...
[22:15:13] Daniel J. Cutter: Might have to resort to getting supplies from one of my "Friends on the other side"
[22:15:29] Ephraim Harris: Right. Because you're waiting on a shipment.
[22:15:30] Daniel J. Cutter: Then again...They don't have access to nearly as much...
[22:15:31] Ephraim Harris: I remember.
[22:15:35] Daniel J. Cutter: If the shipment even comes...
[22:15:41] Daniel J. Cutter: They shut down station 12 I'm fucked
[22:15:53] Daniel J. Cutter: Have to resort to local suppliers...
[22:16:07] Ephraim Harris: I never got too involvedw ith..that stuff.
[22:16:14] Daniel J. Cutter: Good...
[22:16:16] Ephraim Harris: Don't get me wrong, it's great.
[22:16:17] Ephraim Harris: But.
[22:16:19] Daniel J. Cutter: I have debts that need repaying...
[22:16:26] Ephraim Harris: I never knew a guy.
[22:16:28] Daniel J. Cutter: You'll rack them up if you join us too...
[22:16:35] Ephraim Harris: It's not my interest.
[22:17:03] Ephraim Harris: The Combine is awful, but, for a reason not everyone cares about.
[22:17:09] Ephraim Harris: Of course the lack of freedom, but.
[22:17:12] Ephraim Harris: The censorship.
[22:17:14] Ephraim Harris: It's terrible.
[22:17:17] Daniel J. Cutter: Indeed...
[22:17:30] Daniel J. Cutter: Say...I know a guy...in a nearby city...
[22:17:34] Ephraim Harris: They've *destroyed* old records. Not just absorbed them, not just locked them up.
[22:17:36] Daniel J. Cutter: If you want to help me out...
[22:17:42] Ephraim Harris: There are scores of records that are just.. gone.
[22:18:02] Ephraim Harris: There's information we'll never be able to find again because the Combine thinks that the old world isn't relevant
[22:18:11] Ephraim Harris: It has no reason to care. So they tear it down.
[22:18:13] Ephraim Harris: It's.. disgusting.
[22:18:14] Daniel J. Cutter: Indeed they do...
[22:18:25] Ephraim Harris: It fills me with.. anger.
[22:18:39] Ephraim Harris: So, I want to  make a group that protects information.
[22:18:41] Daniel J. Cutter: Well...If you want to help me deal with all that shit...If you could...deliver a message...
[22:18:55] Daniel J. Cutter: You scratch my back...I scratch yours whenever you need some help
[22:19:06] Ephraim Harris: What neesd to be done?
[22:19:45] Daniel J. Cutter: A letter...needs to be put in a specific container in the city...A courier comes in soon and I need to deliver the message saying I need to start contact with my local supplier...
[22:20:03] Ephraim Harris: What's in it for me?
[22:20:17] Daniel J. Cutter: I help you whenever you need help...Or...anything you want from this room...
[22:20:25] Daniel J. Cutter: I know a few guys...
[22:20:30] Ephraim Harris: What's the container?
[22:20:36] Daniel J. Cutter: So then again, you could stop by...I hand over a few things you need...
[22:20:39] Daniel J. Cutter: That?
[22:20:55] Daniel J. Cutter: Thats the "Baron's Gift"
[22:21:00] Ephraim Harris: Am I delivering a letter or a container?
[22:21:04] Daniel J. Cutter: A letter...
[22:21:15] Daniel J. Cutter: The container would get you shot dead if they found out whats in it
[22:21:23] Daniel J. Cutter: The letter on the other hand...
[22:21:30] Daniel J. Cutter: Would confuse the CPs...
[22:21:36] Ephraim Harris: I'm just asking where the container is.
[22:21:56] Daniel J. Cutter: Ah...I'll pull up a map and show you...Leave the room for a moment so I could quickly write up the letter...
[22:22:01] Daniel J. Cutter: Do NOT look at it when you get it...
[22:22:11] Daniel J. Cutter: /me Would unlock the door
