[16:44:15] Justin Bail: // can we just kill him
[16:44:18] Justin Bail: // and put him back here
[16:44:37] Journey Robertson: Well, i'm sorry but your story will end here

[17:06:55] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: // At least that you were in that area.
[17:06:57] Richard Mundy: // it would just be in that general area i'd say
[17:07:19] Journey Robertson: I needed to speak with you on assisting my rebel group, atleast with certain operations that would require a stronger rebel
[17:07:29] Journey Robertson: When the time comes of course, not right now
[17:07:33] Marc 'Watcher 1' Temple: // So yeah. Reminder, unless you were told about biosignals and how they work, y'all might not know.
