[20:12:40] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: This isn't illegal, but nobody's stopping others from forcing you to practice on them, you have no protection in case you treat an anti-citizen, none of that. 
[20:12:52] Ethan Forrester: Right...
[20:12:52] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: And of course you don't have good equipment.
[20:13:08] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Alright, great. You need 5 loyalist points first, but that's not hard to get your hands on.
[20:13:12] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Any other questions for me?
[20:13:24] Ethan Forrester: None that I can think of
[20:14:04] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Alright, great. If you have any other questions, let one of us know.
[20:14:09] Ethan Forrester: Got it
[20:14:12] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /me would hold out the man's CID card, still warm from the printer.
[20:14:25] Ethan Forrester: /me Grabs the card
[20:14:29] Ethan Forrester: Thank you
[20:14:42] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Stay out of trouble.
[20:15:08] Ethan Forrester: Five loyalist points...
[20:15:26] Jonathan Jackson: /me leans onto the bars overlooking the plaza.

[20:16:43] Jonathan Jackson: Sure thing.
[20:16:48] Jonathan Jackson: /me turns around.
[20:16:50] Orlando Trevor Anderson: /ooc I know it's uncouth for the first thing to do is talking OOC, but I believe there may be poison gas in the train station.
[20:17:02] Jonathan Jackson: You see that desk over there? The one next to the two?
[20:17:12] Ethan Forrester: Uh huh.
[20:17:29] Orlando Trevor Anderson: /ooc guess I'll rush through
[20:17:31] Jonathan Jackson: Well, that's where you can go get some work from the CPs.
[20:17:37] Ethan Forrester: Got it.
[20:17:40] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: //no you're all good! you need to put on your suit and filter
[20:17:44] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945 set the hp for Orlando Trevor Anderson to 100
[20:18:00] Jonathan Jackson: Usually it's basic, but it does give you LP once you complete it, quick and easy.
[20:18:07] Orlando Trevor Anderson: /ooc oh shit we goin beta style
[20:18:15] Jonathan Jackson: Stuff like moving around boxes, or refilling a vending machine
[20:18:22] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: //yeah, we're mostly beta style. i mix in some retail HL2 and some alyx stuff but mostly beta
[20:18:25] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: You can step forward.
[20:18:28] Ethan Forrester: Well then it shouldn't be hard to just get 5
[20:18:32] Orlando Trevor Anderson: yes.
[20:18:35] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Relocation coupon.
[20:18:40] Jonathan Jackson: Nope, usually quite easy.
[20:18:52] Jonathan Jackson: You can also turn in contraband, if you don't mind them questioning you after.
[20:18:54] Orlando Trevor Anderson: There it is.
[20:19:01] Ethan Forrester: Understandable
[20:19:08] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /me takes the man's relocation coupon and looks at it closely, making sure it's not counterfeit.
[20:19:10] Jonathan Jackson: What's your name by the way?
[20:19:17] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: one second.
[20:19:19] Ethan Forrester: Ethan. You?
[20:19:35] Jonathan Jackson: Jonathan Jackson, owner of the Grizzly Grotto down the alley.
[20:19:41] Ethan Forrester: Oh interesting
[20:19:51] Ethan Forrester: Well hopefully you stay healthy
[20:20:00] Ethan Forrester: I'm planning to become a local doctor
[20:20:05] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: alright
[20:20:05] Jonathan Jackson: It's going quite well, nice and steady income.
[20:20:09] Jonathan Jackson: Oh really?
[20:20:12] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: I have a few questions for you.
[20:20:19] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: First, I need your date of birth.
[20:20:30] Jonathan Jackson: The CMU is quite understaffed... being the last doctor there died to some guy trying to rob them.
[20:20:33] Jonathan Jackson: ...
[20:20:34] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: .//The current year is 2006, the war was 2003, so the latest year to be born is 1985
[20:20:38] Jonathan Jackson: Well perfect!
[20:20:45] Jonathan Jackson: We needed someone to fill their place.
[20:20:52] Orlando Trevor Anderson: March 23, 1983
[20:20:55] Ethan Forrester: Well then I guess thats where I come in
[20:21:06] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Alright..
[20:21:11] Jonathan Jackson: Yep! Provided you don't run into an armed man with a crowbar, you should do fine.
[20:21:12] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: You're a male, corret?
[20:21:16] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /viewdata orla
[20:21:17] Orlando Trevor Anderson: /looc a.
[20:21:20] Ethan Forrester: What.
[20:21:25] Orlando Trevor Anderson: Yes.
[20:21:33] Jonathan Jackson: Well, there's been a problem recently with robberies.
[20:21:34] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: And... do you know your blood type.
[20:21:41] Ethan Forrester: Ah. Okay
[20:21:44] Orlando Trevor Anderson: Red.
[20:21:50] Jonathan Jackson: But I'm sure you'll be fine.
[20:21:56] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Gotcha. I'm going to mark it as unknown..
[20:21:58] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /viewdata orlan
[20:22:00] Jonathan Jackson: Need that tour by the way? I'd be happy to show you around.
[20:22:10] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: And do you have any mental or physical problems?
[20:22:17] Ethan Forrester: I guess. I do need to start earning credits if I wanna buy more filters
[20:22:27] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: OCD, Eczema, a bad knee, it could be something minor.
[20:22:28] Jonathan Jackson: Or a respirator, that's the big one.
[20:22:31] Jonathan Jackson: Cmon
[20:22:53] Orlando Trevor Anderson: I get really bad headaches when I don't eat my rations.
[20:23:07] Jonathan Jackson: Right here's the warehouses, usually you don't need to be here, but you might have some Work Cycles posted here whenever they feel like it.
[20:23:15] Ethan Forrester: Got it
[20:23:17] Jonathan Jackson: Good way to either get LP or tokens.
[20:23:22] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Right, so you get hungry?
[20:23:43] Orlando Trevor Anderson: Yeah but its like different than hunger
[20:23:51] Jonathan Jackson: Up there is some of the housing, you can get housing by asking one of the CPs.
[20:24:00] Ethan Forrester: Alright
[20:24:03] Orlando Trevor Anderson: Hurts head
[20:24:06] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Gotcha.
[20:24:09] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: One second..
[20:24:11] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /viewdata orla
[20:24:30] Jonathan Jackson: This is the alleyway I was talking about, also down there is the Grotto, it also leads to an entrance to the Construction Zone.
[20:24:37] Jonathan Jackson: But you likely won't need to get in there.
[20:24:37] Ethan Forrester: Uh huh.
[20:24:48] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Alright.
[20:25:16] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: When you need filters, you can buy them from vending machines or from the CHANGE store in the plaza. 
[20:25:34] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: You can also opt out of a suit and buy a respirator if you like being able to wear normal clothes.
[20:25:43] Jonathan Jackson: This is the Metropol, occasionaly you'll need to be here. It houses the Infestation Control Team Headquaters, run by some guy named Alex
[20:25:51] Orlando Trevor Anderson: Suits are cozy.
[20:25:53] Jonathan Jackson: I'd avoid him if I were you, hardcore loyalist.
[20:26:03] Jonathan Jackson: /me shakes his head.
[20:26:16] Ethan Forrester: Mhm. Guess I would be going here alot to deal with the infected
[20:26:27] Orlando Trevor Anderson: /me is smiling like an idiot, even though you can't see it.
[20:26:27] Jonathan Jackson: Yeah, Xen infestation, that sort of stuff.
[20:26:40] Ethan Forrester: My old city got over run with it
[20:26:43] Jonathan Jackson: Also deal with some headcrabs venturing out into the city.
[20:26:49] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Alright, any questions for me?
[20:26:50] Jonathan Jackson: That's why we have them.
[20:27:08] Jonathan Jackson: Right here it the Movie Theater.
[20:27:10] Orlando Trevor Anderson: Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[20:27:16] Ethan Forrester: Wish we still had those
[20:27:21] Orlando Trevor Anderson: /me stands there going "uh" for a solid 30 seconds.
[20:27:29] Client "NamRm" connected.
[20:27:33] Jonathan Jackson: Not really gonna come here unless they have some propoganda they have to sell you for some reason.
[20:27:36] Orlando Trevor Anderson: Where do babies come from?
[20:28:09] Jonathan Jackson: There's nothing really down that way right now, just some unclaimed businesses.
[20:28:12] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /me stands silent for a second, clearly deciding how to handle this.
[20:28:26] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /me inhales, trying to take a patient breath.
[20:28:35] Client "NamRm" spawned in server <STEAM_0:0:69476140> (took 66 seconds).
[20:28:43] Jonathan Jackson: Over here is the Change Store.
[20:28:44] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /me wordlessly holds out the man's newly printed CID for him to take.
[20:28:58] Jonathan Jackson: Most people call it the general store, since it's basically where you can get some general goods.
[20:29:03] Orlando Trevor Anderson: Thank you mister police man officer sir guy
[20:29:06] Ethan Forrester: Good to know
[20:29:22] Jonathan Jackson: It's open 24/7, so it's a nice place to go whenever you need something like food, or a padlock, stuff like that.
[20:29:31] NamRm<STEAM_0:0:69476140> changed their name to Aurelio Grau
[20:29:31] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: You know what?
[20:29:35] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Get on the wall.
[20:29:39] Orlando Trevor Anderson: Oki doki
[20:29:46] Orlando Trevor Anderson: Which one
[20:29:46] Jonathan Jackson: This is the Civil Medical Union Hospital.
[20:29:56] Ethan Forrester: I'm just take a quick peek inside
[20:29:58] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Fence. Whatever. Find a fence unless you want extra lashings.
[20:30:01] Jonathan Jackson: Sure thing
[20:30:05] Orlando Trevor Anderson: Oki doki
[20:30:17] Jonathan Jackson: Nice area right?
[20:30:23] Ethan Forrester: I could see myself here now
[20:30:42] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /r Possible 10-102M at my 10-20, train station. Status green, re-educating.
[20:30:52] Jonathan Jackson: Movin on.
[20:30:55] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /me would take his stunstick from his belt and flick it on low.
[20:30:57] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /toggleraise
[20:31:18] Orlando Trevor Anderson: /me stands there, oblivious.
[20:31:22] Jonathan Jackson: Terminal Hotel right here, just more housing, usually loyalists get to be here or those with lower loyalty points.
[20:31:34] Orlando Trevor Anderson: This is a very nice pole.
[20:31:34] Ethan Forrester: Mhm
[20:31:39] Jonathan Jackson: They have both big and extremly tiny rooms in there.
[20:31:41] Jonathan Jackson: Anyways.
[20:31:51] Ethan Forrester: I should go talk to that CP for some work
[20:31:52] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /me would deliver a firm blow to the man's right shoulder.
[20:32:03] Orlando Trevor Anderson: /me it's like hitting a coffee table.
[20:32:03] Jonathan Jackson: This is Civil Workers Union HQ.
[20:32:14] Jonathan Jackson: Usually a guy named Andrew would be here, but he might be busy.
[20:32:21] Ethan Forrester: Mhm.
[20:32:22] Orlando Trevor Anderson: What was that
[20:32:31] Orlando Trevor Anderson: Hello again
[20:32:31] Jonathan Jackson: This is where Logistics and those in charge work.
[20:32:40] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Is there something wrong with your head?
[20:32:48] Orlando Trevor Anderson: No
[20:32:53] Orlando Trevor Anderson: Is there?
[20:33:00] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: There will be if you keep acting like an idiot.
[20:33:04] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: //sup namrm
[20:33:09] Jonathan Jackson: I could show you the upstairs, but there isn't a whole lot to it.
[20:33:13] Orlando Trevor Anderson: I'm not an actor
[20:33:18] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Face the fence.
[20:33:19] Ethan Forrester: Cool
[20:33:20] Orlando Trevor Anderson: If I was I would have such a cool car
[20:33:20] Aurelio Grau: // hey dude
[20:33:22] Orlando Trevor Anderson: Okay
[20:33:37] Ethan Forrester: Ah I see
[20:33:45] Orlando Trevor Anderson: I'd be like that guy from that boat movie
[20:33:48] Ethan Forrester: Got it
[20:33:52] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /me would flick his stunstick up to medium and hit the man in his left side, between his abs and his stomach.
[20:33:53] Orlando Trevor Anderson: With the pretty lady
[20:33:56] Jonathan Jackson: This is where the Director works, and where you'd apply for CWU.
[20:34:11] Jonathan Jackson: Both the break room and the meeting room are empty, however.
[20:34:16] Ethan Forrester: Mhm
[20:34:29] Orlando Trevor Anderson: /me would stumble around a little from the hit, but continue babbling about a non-existent acting career.
[20:34:46] Jonathan Jackson: Last but not least, the Nexus.
[20:34:52] Jonathan Jackson: Right ahead of us currently
[20:34:57] Ethan Forrester: wow
[20:35:03] Jonathan Jackson: Yep, pretty big.
[20:35:12] Orlando Trevor Anderson: And we would hold hands and wrestle in a car on the boat and i would draw her all pretty like an artist but i would just be acting like an artist because i am an actor and not an artist.
[20:35:21] Ethan Forrester: Interesting
[20:35:23] Jonathan Jackson: Basically, Combine's home base.
[20:35:32] Orlando Trevor Anderson: OH HELLO AGAIN
[20:35:33] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /me would flick his stunstick up to high and hit the man in the head without warning, mid sentence.
[20:35:40] Jonathan Jackson: Only been in here to report stuff and get interrogated, the whole shebang.
[20:35:50] Orlando Trevor Anderson: /me it makes an audible "bonk" noise like a fucking coconut.
[20:35:54] Jonathan Jackson: Not usually keep on letting the civvies walk around inside.
[20:35:58] Orlando Trevor Anderson: Owie.
[20:36:08] Ethan Forrester: Understandable
[20:36:18] Jonathan Jackson: Besides that, over in the corner you have a deposit that goes straight to the main upstairs.
[20:36:21] Jonathan Jackson: /looc man*
[20:36:34] Orlando Trevor Anderson: Oh hey I remember you're the cool police guy who gave me my card
[20:36:36] Jonathan Jackson: I mean you could put letters in there, but he ain't gonna read them.
[20:36:42] Ethan Forrester: Right.
[20:36:43] Orlando Trevor Anderson: How have you been 
[20:36:52] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /me would hit the man again in the head before he could get out his next sentence.
[20:36:52] Jonathan Jackson: Besides that...
[20:37:10] Orlando Trevor Anderson: /me snores.
[20:37:11] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945<STEAM_0:1:53097688> used the tool nocollideeverything on models/industrial_uniforms/pm_industrial_uniform2.mdl
[20:37:12] Jonathan Jackson: Rations are up by those green lights, but they close it up when a cycle isn't goin on.
[20:37:19] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945<STEAM_0:1:53097688> used the tool nocollideeverything on models/industrial_uniforms/pm_industrial_uniform2.mdl
[20:37:19] Ethan Forrester: Cool
[20:37:33] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /r Likely 10-102M is in my custody.
[20:37:35] Orlando Trevor Anderson: /me sleep talks about acting career.
[20:37:57] Jonathan Jackson: Just some general pointers, don't run, don't go into the CWU (at least don't get caught) and try to avoid the loyalists.
[20:38:10] Jonathan Jackson: Besides that, you'll be fine.
[20:38:11] Ethan Forrester: Right..
[20:38:21] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /r I'm gonna give him the test, if he fails to perform, confirmed 10-102M.
[20:38:21] Jonathan Jackson: Oh and I almost forgot...
[20:38:27] Jonathan Jackson: Eh.
[20:38:34] Jonathan Jackson: Right...
[20:38:40] Ethan Forrester: Thats who I need to talk to
[20:38:54] Jonathan Jackson: What I was going to say, make sure you grab a flashlight at Change.
[20:38:56] Orlando Trevor Anderson: OH MY GOD WE TELEPORTED

[20:39:17] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Stop talking.
[20:39:24] Jonathan Jackson: Right, if you need anything else don't hesitate to ask! I'll be mostly by my shop.
[20:39:26] Orlando Trevor Anderson: That is exactly what my mom used to say.
[20:39:33] Orlando Trevor Anderson: ooh a can
[20:39:40] Ethan Forrester: Alright. Well I am going to get some loyalist points so I can become a doctor
[20:39:43] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: get out

[22:57:25] Harold George: /looc At least I assume that's what you are talking about.

[22:58:48] Harold George: /looc Could you see what I said from back there>
[22:58:54] Daniel J. Cutter: Ya know, I doubt you'll even get a swing in with THAT amount of blood leakin' out of you...
[22:59:24] Daniel J. Cutter: Well...I might as well leave you to your own...issues...

[23:00:52] Harold George: /me grabs his torso weakly, raising a crowbar barely in his other arm, trying and failing to look dangerous enough to prevent being attacked again.
[23:01:02] Daniel J. Cutter: /me Would point towards the hole within the ship
[23:01:14] Harold George: How can I t- *groan*
[23:01:19] Daniel J. Cutter: /it Small amounts of leechs would be entering through it...Drawn to the blood
[23:01:24] Harold George: /me graps his chest tighter.

[23:02:07] Harold George: /looc climb*
[23:02:09] Daniel J. Cutter: /me Would raise his axe above his head, threatening the man
[23:02:15] Daniel J. Cutter: Must I repeat myself?

[23:02:30] Daniel J. Cutter: /me Would kick the ladder, making it shake
[23:02:31] Harold George: /looc !*

[23:02:44] Daniel J. Cutter: I'll be back with you...
[23:02:49] Harold George: Wait no!
[23:03:05] Daniel J. Cutter: /me Would step away for a second, grabbing a wodden pallet, putting it over the ladder
[23:03:18] Harold George: /y Let me out!
[23:03:24] Daniel J. Cutter: /y Good luck my friend! Maybe if you come out of this alive! I'll consider you of some use!
[23:03:39] Harold George: /y Fuck, get me out of here!
[23:03:44] Daniel J. Cutter: /it More and more leeches begin to enter through the hole...They're drawn to the blood...
[23:04:05] Harold George: /me grasps the ladder, holding on for dear life.
[23:04:18] Daniel J. Cutter: /it The pallet seems to not fully cover the hole...It could be moved, though it wouldn't be light...
[23:04:51] Daniel J. Cutter: /it With each passing second more leeches enter the ship...
[23:04:53] Harold George: /me reaches up with his injured arm, crying out in desperate pain as he grabs the next step.
[23:05:20] Daniel J. Cutter: /it Blood dripping from your suit into the water...Leeches quickly moving directly under you
[23:05:36] Harold George: /me quickly lets go in his other arm and grasps the next step and hauling himself up.
[23:05:50] Daniel J. Cutter: /looc btw you should feel light headed by now, you're losing quite the amount of blood
[23:06:04] Harold George: /looc Yeah I know, that's why I was pale
[23:06:19] Daniel J. Cutter: /looc I mean vision getting blurry, hard to concentrate sorta thing
[23:06:29] Daniel J. Cutter: /looc and eventually fainting
[23:06:53] Daniel J. Cutter: /it More and more blood drips from your suit into the water, leeches quickly attracted to it
[23:06:54] Harold George: /me reahes up and pushes on the pallet a bit, using his remaining strength to push on it, keeping his eyes locked on as best he can.
[23:07:36] Daniel J. Cutter: /looc Roll 40+ strength with -5 disadvantage
[23:07:48] Harold George: /rollattribute strength
[23:08:24] Daniel J. Cutter: /it The pallet would move slightly, not fully though, the remaining would need to be pushed by something...Or you could risk try with both hands and risk falling off...
[23:08:24] Harold George: /looc that would succeed right?
[23:08:29] Daniel J. Cutter: /looc Almost
[23:08:40] Harold George: /looc move it a bit so I can get an idea
[23:09:39] Harold George: /me unslings his crowbar from his back in his other hand, almost letting go out of sheer pain but managing to get it, then uses it's hook to further push it back.
[23:09:40] Daniel J. Cutter: /it More blood drips from your suit into the water...Its hard to see the ships bottom from all the leeches
[23:09:53] Daniel J. Cutter: /looc roll 40+ with -5 disadvantage
[23:10:06] Harold George: /rollattribute strength
[23:10:24] Daniel J. Cutter: /it The pallet only barely moves...More blood drips with each second...
[23:10:37] Harold George: Mmphh...
[23:10:46] Daniel J. Cutter: /looc you should react with higher amounts of blood loss
[23:11:01] Daniel J. Cutter: /looc or you could faint
[23:11:40] Harold George: /me reaches a leg around the ladder, feeling it barely respond to what his brain is trying to process, and barely hooks it around securing himself in place without his hand... *barely*. It wouldn't take much to move him though if pressure was placed.
[23:12:08] Harold George: /me then reaches his two hands up again at the very close pallets, and uses his combined strength to push it aside.
[23:12:23] Daniel J. Cutter: /looc roll 40+ with -8 Disadvantage
[23:12:30] Harold George: /rollattribute strength
[23:12:35] Harold George: /looc bruh I hate rolling
[23:12:54] Daniel J. Cutter: /it You would barely be able to move the pallet, your hands slipping off the pallet
[23:13:34] Daniel J. Cutter: /it More blood drips from your boots into the water...The leeches remaining directly under you
[23:13:59] Harold George: /me struggles to balance himself without grabbing the ladder, and before falling the ladder with a single arm the wounded arm feeling much more limp as his vision disorients his surroundings.
[23:14:39] Daniel J. Cutter: /chargiveitem cutter blood 1
[23:14:59] Harold George: /me tries to shuffle up another step of the ladder, his arm barely holding on as he moves one foot up a step at a time, then pushing up his a hugely pained groan up to grab a higher step.
[23:15:34] Harold George: /me then uses his head and body weight as a near final push to move it aside, heaving into it as he does so.
[23:15:38] Daniel J. Cutter: /it The sun beams directly into your gas mask and into your eyes...
[23:15:51] Harold George: /looc bro what fuckin sun, it's on the other side lol

[23:16:52] Daniel J. Cutter: /it Blood continues to drip from your boot and into the water...
[23:17:33] Harold George: /me barely can focus on it at this point with his arms wobbling in depiration for his overworked muscles to hold on.
[23:18:09] Harold George: Oh crii--aist.
[23:18:28] Harold George: That assssho.
[23:18:39] Harold George: /y GET baCK!
[23:18:48] Daniel J. Cutter: /it The blood loss would slow...though not dripping as much...It may not be a good thing...
[23:19:23] Harold George: /me with a renewed sense of purpose barely focused in his mind, he slams agains the pallet to get it to move another time.
[23:19:42] Daniel J. Cutter: /looc roll 40+ strength with -11 disadvantage
[23:19:52] Harold George: /looc I literally swear to god

[23:22:04] Harold George: /me lifts his arm through the crack, grabbing the upper deck of the boat yet not fully able to get his torso up due to the pallet and only his head, twisted sideways
[23:22:43] Harold George: /me then bangs against the pallet, one of his feet coming off of the ladder and off the side limp, only with an arm and a leg holding on.
