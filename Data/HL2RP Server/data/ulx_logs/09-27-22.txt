[14:14:17] CCA.C17-UNION.i2.07979: Coupon
[14:14:49] Karl Merks: Now now laddie you need to come here for me to hand it to you, how preposterous of a suggestion of me to give you a coupon without having a hand to put it in right?
[14:15:19] CCA.C17-UNION.i2.07979: You get over here.
[14:16:14] Karl Merks: Quite the figher ain't ya? Now no problem good sir of mine for this is of no problem for an individual such as myself good sir, it is best we get aquainted after all.
[14:16:23] Karl Merks: /me chuckles at the preposterous thought.
[14:16:42] Karl Merks: /me takes out a small coupon with registration on it.
[14:16:55] CCA.C17-UNION.i2.07979: /me takes the coupon out of his hand.
[14:17:19] Karl Merks: Now I do believe that the sires at the other station made sure that everything was correct, indeed I would hope because it certainly would be a hassel if it weren't true.
[14:17:28] Karl Merks: /me shakes his head at the thought.
[14:17:43] Karl Merks: But I am sure nothing will come of it!
[14:18:22] CCA.C17-UNION.i2.07979: /me reads the card. He pulls out his PDA, typing on it.
[14:18:28] CCA.C17-UNION.i2.07979: /viewdata karl
[14:18:40] Karl Merks: As I said quite in line my dearest officer.
[14:18:50] CCA.C17-UNION.i2.07979: Blood type and date of birth.
[14:20:33] Karl Merks: What? I was sure that they had my information on file beforehand, I did say to the man in charge, "Sir, I wish to speak with you on the matter that my registration be filled out percisely as it is supposed to be, for this is a matter of grave importants, I shan't hassle the good benefactor on the other end due to your own negligence, unfitting of me to do so. So please, make sure it is all written down proper as it should."
[14:21:39] Karl Merks: Quite the young fellow that one was, but he doesn't seem to have a days worth of experience in the field, could you imagine such an individual, seemingly incohearent of the situation around him? Nonsense good sir, nonsense simply.
[14:21:48] Karl Merks: /me continues rambling.
[14:22:29] Karl Merks: I do quite say though the office was of stellar condition, it is simply not unlike anything I have seen so far in my journey in this train station, no offense good sir.
[14:22:58] Karl Merks: Ah city nine, such a humble abode that was, I believ the local administration there was in tip top shape indubitably!
[14:23:03] CCA.C17-UNION.i2.07979: Stop
[14:23:18] Karl Merks: Oh, sorry, I must've gone on rambling again. My apologies!
[14:23:36] CCA.C17-UNION.i2.07979: The only thing I want to know is your date of birth and bloodtype.
[14:24:41] Karl Merks: Oh no problem sir, I do believe my date of birth as recorded in the calender was eh, the tenth of July, nineteen-sixty seven, quite a long time it has been hasn't it!

[14:25:31] Karl Merks: Now for my blood type, I do believe I have a doctors note from quite a while ago with it recorded, if you don't mind me searching for it for a second! Quite clumbsy of me not to have all of my papers out, I do apologize.
[14:25:42] CCA.C17-UNION.i2.07979: Go for it.
[14:26:17] Karl Merks: /me reaches into his pocket and searches around, pulling out a folded paper neatly within a lettering stamped with a CMU symbol.
[14:26:38] Karl Merks: Ah yes here it may be, let me just skim over it, I wouldn't want to waste your time now right!
[14:26:53] Karl Merks: /me opens it up, and looks through the entire paper.
[14:27:51] Karl Merks: Hm, no I am afraid that this one appears to be nothing quite more than a recent perscription I had ordered at the behest of my employer, you see. Let me check the next paper if you do not mind of course, for this paper simply won't do for what we are looking for.
[14:28:23] Karl Merks: /me then neatly fold back the paper in his hand placing it in his other pocket, then he takes out another paper from the other pocket.
[14:28:59] Karl Merks: Oh wouldn't you look at that chap! Just some reports on my recent rent payments, nothing of use currently, unless you were to be my lord of housing mind you!
[14:29:09] CCA.C17-UNION.i2.07979: Mhm.
[14:29:13] Karl Merks: /me neatly folds the paper again, putting it in his other pocket.
[14:29:26] Karl Merks: /me then reaches in his pocket and pulls out another paper.
[14:29:36] Karl Merks: /me unfolds it, reading it carefully.
[14:29:48] Karl Merks: Ah yes here we go, this seems to be the one!
[14:30:32] Karl Merks: /me looks over it all together, looking over the many different sections describing his blood in great detail as a part of blood work he had previously gotten.
[14:31:28] Karl Merks: Hm yes, I do see it, it looks to start with the letter A mind you, but I can't tell if that symbol hither is either a positive or a negative! Woe is me, for how my eyesight has declined over the years!
[14:31:43] CCA.C17-UNION.i2.07979: Let me see it.
[14:31:46] Karl Merks: Here, why don't you read it, you young chaps I'm sure can make it out.
[14:31:52] Karl Merks: /me hands over the paper.
[14:32:09] CCA.C17-UNION.i2.07979: /me takes the paper and reads it.
[14:33:17] Karl Merks: /it The paper appears to be a medical doccument dating years ago for bloodwork by a certain Dr. Rosenburg. The blood work is nothing out of the ordinary, as far as you can tell not having medical training. At the top is a emboldened, "A+"
[14:33:54] CCA.C17-UNION.i2.07979: /me hands the paper back over.

[14:34:13] Karl Merks: /me takes the paper and folds it neatly and places it in his other pocket.

[14:34:41] Karl Merks: I'm sure you got what you are looking for! Those gizmos right there on your faceplate could see anything a kilometer away!
[14:34:55] Karl Merks: /me takes the CID in his hand.
[14:35:46] Karl Merks: Ah thank you good sir, it was quite alright meeting you and I do hope to enjoy your company in the future, incase any ruffians come to shake me down in an ol' alleyway! No problem good sir, do be taking care now!

[15:41:13] Tevor Jefferson: then youd want a weapon
[15:41:47] Karl Merks: Now that's quite preposturous not only limited by how threatening it may be sir, please if you may I don't want to entertain this line of questioning anymore.

Now the whole city shall be looking quite spiffy until those miscreants start loitering and littering of the property for shame. Though it will be quite good for a while now.
[15:49:44] CCA.C17-UNION.i2.07979: Yeah?
