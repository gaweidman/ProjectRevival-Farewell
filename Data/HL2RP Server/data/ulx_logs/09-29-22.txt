[14:17:51] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: You can also buy a respirator which doesn't require filters and is much less invasive than a large oxygen suit.

[23:20:08] Andrew Cloverman: //what branch
[23:20:18] Karl Merks: Oh what pleasant surroundings this area sure does hold, quite the view I must say, reminds me of City-12 quite so!
[23:20:26] Karl Merks: // Find out ICly?
[23:20:29] Karl Merks: // :)
[23:21:04] Andrew Cloverman: Hey, how can I help you?
[23:21:14] Andrew Cloverman: /charsethunger andrew 100
[23:21:17] Andrew Cloverman: /charsetthirst andrew 100
[23:22:14] Karl Merks: Ah hello there young chap, quite jolly to find such a quaint residence for the CWU now eh? Innit brilliant what our benefactors provide for us on the daily, quite the contrary to what those mooks shillng out their blackmarket goons said on the train here, but I didn't believe a word!
[23:22:55] Karl Merks: Though I didn't partake in this journey only to ramble on about the niceties of the office you reside in currently, I came to inquire about obtaining a position in the Civil Workers Union! Yes quite that really!
[23:24:10] Karl Merks: Of course I will fully understand if you aren't allowing new applications for I shall have an eternity of patience to use at a whim, but nevertheless it is best to inquire so that the oppertunity doesn't get taken by another individual such as myself!
[23:24:53] Andrew Cloverman: .//as soon as you step out of this building, i'm going to do a /event for a a vending machine to fall out of the sky and turn you to dust
[23:25:01] Karl Merks: /looc lmao
[23:25:30] Karl Merks: /looc Karl merks just has a grand vocabulary and is a great rambler
[23:26:34] Andrew Cloverman: ...Right. What branch were you trying to apply to?
[23:27:17] Karl Merks: Now, I did come prepared for this exact pondering you might have had, therefor I deducted the best thing to do was to bring my own documents in order to fully grasp the decision ahead of me!
[23:28:05] Karl Merks: /me takes out a folded papers one by one, opens them up to full view and places them on the counter one by one, they are all very detailed accounts of all the branches of the CWU.
[23:28:35] Karl Merks: Of course what man could I be if I didn't take into account all of the different positives of each branch and my own skillset.
[23:29:39] Karl Merks: Now I do believe that logistics would be off the table due to my quite humble nature in the height catagory, even though I can assure you I am at peak physical health for my age! It doesn't matter much if I can't reach the top shelf when my employer asks me to bring out a box!
[23:29:50] Karl Merks: /me does a belly laugh before continuing.
[23:31:06] Karl Merks: I am afraid I have little in the way of practical medical training, so therefor that option is cut out right in the begining leaving only the Infestation Control Team as well as the Commerce branch, however I see it mostly fit to join the Commerce branch considering my skillset as a exquisit linguist in all manners of culture and knowlege of the dictionary inside and out!
[23:32:25] Karl Merks: Does that answer your question good sir? I do hope you were paying attention, for I do tend to be a small bit descriptive though my peers have described it to be miniscule so I doubt fully that could've affected your understanding! Quite clearly you were very dilligent, it is only natural in your line of work I assume.
[23:33:14] Andrew Cloverman: It does. You've definitely got a thesaurus or two on the mind. But, sure. Commerce.
[23:33:33] Karl Merks: Quite so chap, quite so!
[23:34:40] Karl Merks: What may the next step be? I quite do want to see how the beuracracy efficently handles all of it's members and clientel in the matter of moments, I doubt even for a second it could be pondered to be inefficent, it is the Civil Workers Union after all!
[23:37:09] Andrew Cloverman: I'll need to bring someone over for a loyalist point check, if that goes well then you can interview with the interim director of the CWU.
[23:37:45] Andrew Cloverman: If you don't mind giving me a second in the back, I'll try to get a unit over here and do the paperwork for a new transfer.
[23:38:06] Karl Merks: No problem I believe these standard procedures can be crucial in determining the qualifications of applicants! I do not mind whatever you shall due so long as it benefits in the process!
[23:38:50] Andrew Cloverman: Great, I'll be right back.
[23:39:01] Karl Merks: Perfection indeed good sir.
[23:39:07] Andrew Cloverman: /me turns directly after speaking, very obviously done with the interaction, but not in a way that's overtly rude.

[23:41:37] Karl Merks: Ahh hello there you must be the good officer who has come to assist in my application towards benefiting the city as a whole, splended indeed!
[23:41:47] Karl Merks: /looc splendid*
[23:42:10] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /me flatly stops the man barely after his last word gets out.
[23:42:12] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Nope.
[23:42:15] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /me speaks into his radio.

[23:42:24] Karl Merks: I do hope you had a quite alright time venturing forth through the streets-
[23:42:33] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /me turns and leaves the room without saying another word to the man.
[23:42:41] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /r LP check. Your job, I have anything else to do.
[23:42:44] Karl Merks: Oh quite alright, I do not mind waiting any longer, for it is quite good--
[23:42:58] Karl Merks: /me is talking in the distance.
[23:43:10] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912<STEAM_0:1:53097688> changed their name to CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945

[23:44:13] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /me would clear his throat loudly to get the citizen's attention.
[23:44:20] Karl Merks: /looc Oops doing homework

[23:44:41] Karl Merks: /looc Nah it's due in the morning
[23:44:48] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: .//alright
[23:45:43] Karl Merks: Hello there good chap of mind, innit a nice day indeed? I was hoping that your deliverance to this place of residence for the Civil Workers Union would be perfectly splendid in timing and it sure seems to be that case considering your position as of now!
[23:46:19] Karl Merks: /me smiles genuinely happy to see the officer, as well strange as it might be considering he doesn't even know the person.
[23:47:24] Karl Merks: I do hope your trip was perfect coming down from your headquaters, my you should definitely be commended for you actions seeing how fast you managed to arrive here, that is quite unheard of in City-13, quite the contrast!
[23:47:48] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Yeah, we try to cover the city well. You're the one trying to get an LP check, right?
[23:48:48] Karl Merks: I do believe you are correct good sir, at least I would hope, I do need my Loyalty Points checked for the individual here, all part of the process and we must all oblige our roles as it is layed out for us perfectly by the system! I do believe you will be needing me to apply so I shall do that right now to get it out of the way.
[23:48:49] Karl Merks: /apply
[23:49:24] Karl Merks: There we go, good to always have it memorized, never a dull moment making sure you are always learning!
