[00:00:22] Karl Merks: /me is still droning on while they talk complementing the building, the system and basically everything in general about the city.
[00:00:32] Alex Palovichov: /me Glances over at the man
[00:01:17] Karl Merks: Right anyways, I do not mean to bore you any more with my own thoughs about the perfect situation I find myself in and which I desire to be in, I am quite ready for what you must do with me now.

[00:03:03] Karl Merks: /me takes a seat in the rigid chair infront of them.
[00:03:18] Anna Gottlieb: /me goes behind the desk and sits in the chair, keeping her legs together and her hands at her sides.
[00:03:38] Karl Merks: Quite a nice chair here indeed, quite comforatable I must say, very spacious indeed to what I currently have available to me, but I manage!
[00:04:13] Anna Gottlieb: Alright, I already know  your name. Let's start with what comes first. Whtat work did you do before the war?
[00:06:54] Karl Merks: Before the way, ma'am I do need to inform you that during that time I was achieving my PhD in Phillosophy, it was my second degree I was hoping to achieve for what I believed my line of work would be as a Historian at a museum of arts! Of course that never came to be, but my interests in the inner workings of society and phillosphy as a whole never died down! My parrents were very well off mind you, their spending habbits were exquisit in their nature and our modern currency had been adopted it too also re-
[00:09:10] Karl Merks: linquished our fortune, but luckily I did not rely on it so, instead I worked back to gain what I needed to achieve a very comfortable lifestyle in City-13, I ended up as lower administration in the local Civil Workers Union in the region before I relinquished the title in order to retire before I was told to come to City-17 for relocation, not that I am complaining for I do insist this is a very humble abode.

[00:11:32] Alex Palovichov: /me Would continue to eat   *Peters*   Sandwich 
[00:11:35] Karl Merks: // Screw peter all my homies hate peter
