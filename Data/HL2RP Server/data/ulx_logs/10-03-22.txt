[15:49:10] Jacob Desmone: I'm pretty good with commerce and electronics so

[15:50:35] Jonathan Jackson: I appreciate the complement, any previous work experience?
[15:50:49] Jacob Desmone: Before the war or during combine?
[15:50:55] Jonathan Jackson: Any.
[15:51:35] Jacob Desmone: Not really
[15:51:44] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: //hot take: food tastes good sometimes

[15:53:01] Jonathan Jackson: Got it, we only require practical experience here. What do you think you can offer here?
[15:53:18] Jonathan Jackson: /me sits up.
[15:53:27] Ryan Maley: Hi, how's it going.
[15:53:33] Jonathan Jackson: Ah hello! He's here to apply to work here.
[15:53:46] Ryan Maley: Oh, great. I'll have a seat, then.
[15:53:54] Ryan Maley: /me takes a seat in the booth.
[15:54:14] Jonathan Jackson: Right, so you were telling me about what you can offer right?
[15:55:36] Major-General Sir Issac Brock KB to admins: hmm
[15:55:46] Major-General Sir Issac Brock KB to admins: idea for a nano-event
[15:55:50] Major-General Sir Issac Brock KB to admins: train derailment
[15:56:00] Jacob Desmone: Yea so when I put my mind to something I usually do it way better than others and I would love to work here because it just seems like a great enviorment as ive mentioned 
[15:56:45] Jacob Desmone: Ive got a good sight about this place so I would focus on this a lot instead of other things since I really don't have much to do
[15:56:48] Ryan Maley to admins: this might be cool. plus it oculd get fuckin uhhh
[15:57:28] Major-General Sir Issac Brock KB to admins: it'd be neat if we could play sound effects, like a huge crash sound
[15:57:33] Major-General Sir Issac Brock KB to admins: to accompany a /event
[15:57:33] Jonathan Jackson: Right, that sounds pretty good to me, it's great to have hardworking people especially in the restuarant business.
[15:57:44] Jonathan Jackson: Now, have you done any recent community service?
[15:57:46] Ryan Maley to admins: it oculd be free supplies
[15:57:48] Ryan Maley to admins: for people
[15:58:00] Major-General Sir Issac Brock KB to admins: yeah
[15:58:14] Jacob Desmone: A bit yea I cleared the construction zone of some trash and delievred some goods here 
[15:58:20] Jacob Desmone: And worked with the ICT manager
[15:59:09] Jonathan Jackson: Community work is always great, it reflects exactly who you are as a person, now I'll hand over some questions to Ryan here, so he can get a feel for you.
[15:59:28] Jonathan Jackson: /looc ryan
[15:59:34] Jonathan Jackson: /looc are you alive
[15:59:34] Ryan Maley: .//sorry
[15:59:52] Major-General Sir Issac Brock KB: // alright, i gotta hop off. dont hesitate to ping or dm me if you need me
[15:59:53] Dropped "Major-General Sir Issac Brock KB" from server<STEAM_0:0:193599766>
[16:00:23] Ryan Maley: That all sounds great. So, working here, what role would you take on?
[16:01:11] Jacob Desmone: Well generally I can do a lot of things but I would say possibly Janitor/Tech as I have fixed a lot of stuff for the combine before
[16:01:31] Jacob Desmone: I could clean some stuff up and if anythings breaks I can probably fix it
[16:02:05] Ryan Maley: Gotcha, that sounds good. Have you ever worked in a commercial dishpit?
[16:02:24] Jacob Desmone: No, not yet.
[16:03:22] Ryan Maley: No worries, just trying to field your experience. So, the role I can picture is cleaning, bussing, dishwashing especially, and then you'd be working closely with some of the more harsh chemials.
[16:03:29] Ryan Maley: degreaser, bleach, ammonia, not all at once.
[16:03:41] Jonathan Jackson: You'd hope that!
[16:03:43] Jacob Desmone: Yea obviously bleach and ammonia is not a good mix.
[16:03:58] Jacob Desmone: Thats how you make mustard gas.
[16:04:08] Ryan Maley: .//UM ACKCHYUALLY
[16:04:10] Ryan Maley: .//IT MAKES CHLORINE GAS
[16:04:13] Ryan Maley: .//NOT MUSTARD GAS
[16:04:22] Jonathan Jackson: /looc like you'd know that ICly
[16:04:28] Ryan Maley: .//no i odn't
[16:04:31] Ryan Maley: .//i don't know that ICly
[16:04:36] Ryan Maley: .//that's why i said it in LOOC
[16:04:38] Jacob Desmone: .// I put so many points into intellegence so I can cook with evan
[16:04:43] Jacob Desmone: .// I wish to make
[16:04:48] Jacob Desmone: .// gas

[16:05:22] Jacob Desmone: .// the gas is coming
[16:05:23] Jonathan Jackson: Right, anymore questions you've got for them?
[16:05:27] Ryan Maley: .//the gas is seeping in
[16:05:34] Jacob Desmone: .// You cannot stop it
[16:05:36] Jacob Desmone: .// its already over
[16:05:43] Ryan Maley: .//the gas kills sus people
[16:05:58] Jacob Desmone: .// me and evan are gonna cook crack u want in
[16:06:26] Jonathan Jackson: /looc I thought this was a rebel opperation
[16:06:28] Ryan Maley: I think that's about it. I know a bit about cleaning and handyman things, but I can't handle it all myself. I can absolutely see you having a role here
[16:06:50] Jacob Desmone: Sounds good
[16:07:02] Jonathan Jackson: Perfect, so here's what I think, you come back in lets say a quarter of an hour and we'll have a decision.
[16:07:22] Jacob Desmone: Sounds good
[16:07:46] Jonathan Jackson: Perfect! I'll let you back out, Ryan we can talk right after.
[16:07:52] Ryan Maley: Absolutely
[16:08:01] Jonathan Jackson: It was great to have you here!
[16:08:28] Jonathan Jackson: /looc lol
[16:08:41] Jonathan Jackson: Alright, what's your thoughts?
[16:09:11] Ryan Maley: He seems promising, for sure. I think he's got potential. I don't know if I *trust* him, if you catch my drift.
[16:09:17] Ryan Maley: but, he doesn't seem like a bad guy
[16:09:26] Jonathan Jackson: Hmm, I get it.
[16:10:09] Jonathan Jackson: I think that he has enough potential to try out for a while, and we can see how it goes.
[16:10:12] Nathan Pierce: /pm Ryan Okay so, I'm going off. Will there be a Conscript app added in soon?
[16:10:30] Ryan Maley: /pm pierce Yes, like I said I'll have it done by the end of the day.
[16:10:33] Jonathan Jackson: I think he'll do well in the back, see if he's up for the task to prepare some stuff too.
[16:10:43] Nathan Pierce: /reply Alright, cya later.
[16:10:52] Ryan Maley: /pm nathan thanks for being on, see you
[16:10:58] Ryan Maley: Yeah, I agree. I have no objections
[16:11:02] Nathan Pierce: // Alright, I'm off.  Cya.
[16:11:02] Jonathan Jackson: /looc misclick
[16:11:07] Jonathan Jackson: // See ya
[16:11:09] Dropped "Nathan Pierce" from server<STEAM_0:1:626926779>
[16:11:39] Jonathan Jackson: Alright, I'll inform him right when he gets back, then I'll give him the jist of what he's got to do.
[16:12:08] Ryan Maley: Sounds good.
[16:12:12] Ryan Maley: Also, hey
[16:12:17] Ryan Maley: Do you know what in the hell these are?
[16:12:25] Jonathan Jackson: Not, really...
[16:12:31] Ryan Maley: I didn't put them there, I figured you did
[16:12:38] Ryan Maley: but.
[16:12:42] Ryan Maley: ...Yeah
[16:12:46] Jonathan Jackson: I see them around in very specific places, they seem to lead somewhere, I don't know where though...
[16:12:54] Jonathan Jackson: It's a mystery to me.
[16:13:09] Jonathan Jackson: Some Vort probably got loose and wrote it down if you asked me.
[16:13:24] Ryan Maley: Should we have him try to clean it off?
[16:13:39] Jonathan Jackson: Eh, I tried already. Couldn't really make a dent.
[16:13:45] Jonathan Jackson: Maybe I can call ICT over.
[16:14:35] Jonathan Jackson: I find it weird that one's right infront of the bathroom, I think it's also in one of the stalls.
[16:14:44] Ryan Maley: Yeah, very weird.
[16:14:53] Ryan Maley: .//i thought they were..hodl on. let me message DRD
[16:15:00] Jonathan Jackson: /looc Sure
[16:15:28] Ryan Maley: Maybe, but that would mean having Alex in here
[16:15:42] Jonathan Jackson: Yeah, you're right. Not a big fan of him.
[16:15:57] Jonathan Jackson: I think they hired a new guy though, but I'm not certain.
[16:16:19] Jonathan Jackson: Either way, not much I can do about em nor anyone else.
[16:16:51] Ryan Maley: We could paint over it, maybe
[16:17:12] Jonathan Jackson: That means painting this entire way, I think it ruins the flow.
[16:17:32] Jonathan Jackson: Tell you what, I'll go over to the logistics guy later today and ask about it.
[16:17:45] Jonathan Jackson: See if they got some strong bleach or something like that.
[16:18:06] Ryan Maley: Alright, thanks.
[16:18:29] Ryan Maley: //ICly it's chalk

[22:13:43] Jonathan Jackson: Got a job in CWU after a bit of effort and here we are.
[22:14:50] Aurelio Grau: Y'know, I have the exact same story as you. Minus the effort for my Civil Worker's job. Got it for free. No LP needed. Just an interview.
[22:15:15] Jonathan Jackson: Sounds like a good deal, I would've prefered that given a chance.
[22:15:26] Aurelio Grau: Naturally.
[22:15:35] Jonathan Jackson: But anyways, a little more personal but still, you got an opinion on our benefactors?
[22:15:53] Jonathan Jackson: Obviously don't mind if you don't want to share.
[22:16:41] Aurelio Grau: Eh. Would it be better with out 'them'? Hell yes. Do I do everything I can to avoid helpin' 'em? Yup.
[22:17:04] Aurelio Grau: /me takes a sip from the beer. What is the quality of it?
[22:17:33] Jonathan Jackson: UU Branded, our bear ain't craft like our other drinks.
[22:17:38] Jonathan Jackson: /looc beer*
[22:18:08] Jonathan Jackson: /looc void then
[22:18:34] Jonathan Jackson: /it About on par with UU products, not complete pisswater but not the best drink you've had by far.
[22:18:53] Jonathan Jackson: Yeah our beer ain't craft, we've got other stuff hand made, way better.
[22:19:21] Aurelio Grau: Well. Not like I'd notice too much anyways.
[22:19:31] Aurelio Grau: I never really drink. Not into that stuff.
[22:19:58] Jonathan Jackson: I can't denounce that stuff, would be bad considering I run a bar here.
[22:20:08] Jonathan Jackson: A bit now and then doesn't hurt, takes the edge off so I heard.
[22:20:29] Jonathan Jackson: /me yawns and leans back.
[22:20:36] Aurelio Grau: Yeah. Alcohol does that.
[22:21:13] Jonathan Jackson: Bout the combine though, since you shared I might as well. Did you hear on the broadcast where that guy said Jo- then cut off? Yeah that was my letter and every damn word in it was true,
[22:21:28] Jonathan Jackson: Course they play it off, why wouldn't they? But it's still annoying,
[22:21:49] Jonathan Jackson: They ain't doin anything about the corruption in their ranks, frankly absurd to me but what can you do about it?
[22:22:26] Jonathan Jackson: Eh, besides that I'm not too mad at them, just taking it as it goes. I'd say neutral on the love to hate spectrum.
[22:22:43] Jonathan Jackson: That guy Alex though, he catches you for one second badmouthing them and it's a report.
[22:22:55] Aurelio Grau: Oh? The ICT manager you mean.
[22:23:03] Jonathan Jackson: Yeah, that one.
[22:23:23] Aurelio Grau: He compensated me my tokens when a guy took a hundred off me.
[22:23:36] Jonathan Jackson: He does that, but I feel like its a trick.
[22:24:02] Jonathan Jackson: He acts all nice but the second you say anything that gives a hint of doing something wrong he gets a CP beatin you during a interrogation.
[22:24:05] Jonathan Jackson: /me shakes his head.
[22:24:07] Jonathan Jackson: I should know.
[22:24:11] Aurelio Grau: Oh yeah?
[22:24:21] Jonathan Jackson: He was responsible for me getting locked up twice.
[22:24:59] Jonathan Jackson: Once cause the CPs were askin around about him and I was the closest target to get information beaten out of, and the second time because he found it suspicious that I had a business in an alleyway next to the CZ.
[22:25:13] Jonathan Jackson: Course he tips me anytime he comes here, but I don't trust him at all.
[22:25:40] Aurelio Grau: He totally had real rich uptight parents before the war.
[22:25:52] Aurelio Grau: Can't comprehend what a bar is supposed to be like.
[22:26:12] Aurelio Grau: Little grungy, but all familiar, y'know?
[22:26:21] Jonathan Jackson: /me nods.
[22:26:27] Jonathan Jackson: Yeah, something like that.
[22:27:03] Jonathan Jackson: I'm trying to just run my shop now, it's a safe haven from those CPs in there besides when they get me to make the Administrators lunch.
[22:27:18] Aurelio Grau: That's something they do? Nice
[22:27:24] Jonathan Jackson: Did it once.
[22:27:27] Jonathan Jackson: /me shrugs.
[22:27:37] Jonathan Jackson: He still trash talks me too.
[22:27:45] Aurelio Grau: Huh
[22:28:01] Jonathan Jackson: Eh, again what can you do about it.
[22:28:16] Jonathan Jackson: Combine's here to stay whether you like it or not, just gotta deal with it and make the best of it.
[22:29:00] Aurelio Grau: Sure. Unless some massive part of the population comes together and starts a massive revolution. Good luck with that, though.
[22:29:12] Jonathan Jackson: /me scoffs.
[22:29:33] Jonathan Jackson: As if, I get somebody robbing down the alleyway nearly every day, if these guys cooperate I'd be damned
[22:29:51] Jonathan Jackson: Sure would be nice, but unfeasable with everyone's self intrest meters running high.
[22:30:27] Jonathan Jackson: Plus, how would a couple hundred guys stand up to that technology?
[22:30:54] Aurelio Grau: Technology ain't worth a damn. Look at Korea, Vietnam.
[22:31:24] Aurelio Grau: Those guys had nothing, yet still kicked our asses in a war we shoulda' won.
[22:31:54] Jonathan Jackson: Interesting point, a historian too? You keep getting higher on my list.
[22:32:19] Jonathan Jackson: I need to go get things wrapped up in the back though, this was a nice chat.
[22:32:24] Jonathan Jackson: /me gets up from the table.
[22:32:29] Aurelio Grau: Alright. Yeah, sounds good.
[22:32:40] Jonathan Jackson: Consider that beer on the house.
[22:32:45] Aurelio Grau: Ah, thanks man.
[22:32:47] Jonathan Jackson: Have a good one, stay safe out there.
[22:32:52] Aurelio Grau: You too.
