[21:59:10] Ephraim Harris: Hope that won't bite me in the ass. Half of these people aren't allowed to know what Fahrenheit 451 is, let alone do they know when it was published.
[21:59:24] Ephraim Harris: Feel free to make yourself at home. I haven't really.. populated the place.
[21:59:36] Aurelio Grau: Yeah, alright.
[21:59:39] CCA.C17-UNION.i2.51514: /me finished typing, nodding his head lightly as he powered the UU PDA down. - "Right, papers please."
[21:59:40] Aurelio Grau: Thanks.
[22:00:00] Ephraim Harris: Yeah, thank you. Consider this a primary home, if you like. Or a second home. I intend to live here, personally.
[22:00:04] Otto Von Habsburg: I don't know if you got updated on it, but all they give us is these "Relocation Coupons."
[22:00:23] Otto Von Habsburg: /me takes out a small metal bar from his pocket, and quickly hands it over to the CP across from him.
[22:00:33] CCA.C17-UNION.i2.51514: /me sniffled, shaking his head lightly as he latched the PDA down across his waist. - "I see."
[22:00:33] Aurelio Grau: I think that's a decent idea. I may take all the possessions that I'm hoarding and bring 'em over here from my apartment bathroom.
[22:00:49] Ephraim Harris: Feel free, I'd be happy to help you move.
[22:00:53] Aurelio Grau: Good resources like metals, electronics.

[22:01:08] Aurelio Grau: Guess we should introduce to each other our full names?
[22:01:21] Otto Von Habsburg: /me looks over at the CP and what they are doing, taking note of the operation.
[22:01:35] Ephraim Harris: /me chuckles. That'd be a good idea, huh? 
[22:01:50] CCA.C17-UNION.i2.51514: /me took the freshly printed card from the ID machine, looking it over to insure it was accurate before turning around. - "Right."
[22:02:03] Ephraim Harris: Ephraim Harris. I go by Bezalel or Loew.

[22:04:33] CCA.C17-UNION.i2.51514: /me took the papers, flipping through them quickly as he read over the important sections of the paper with a skilled eye. Finally pocketing the papers and turning around. - "Attach, I'll get you set up."
[22:04:49] Otto Von Habsburg: /me follovvs along.
[22:05:32] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Damn, you've got a nice place here.

[22:35:38] Daniel J. Cutter: Good evening my friends...
[22:35:46] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I feel like we should use the reinforced lock on something important.
[22:35:49] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Like.
[22:35:50] Aurelio Grau: Yup.
[22:35:58] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: One container that is full of good things.

[22:36:00] Stewie Lou: well imma go now... bye!
[22:36:01] Otto Von Habsburg: /me sits down on the metal plating.
[22:36:03] Ethan King: /me glanced over at the man wearing a worker suit, nodding. - "Seems we've another individual rising up."
[22:36:10] Aurelio Grau: Contraband, maybe.
[22:36:18] Ethan King: Good to see the sewers of this sector so.... active
[22:36:18] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Yeah, like this stuff here.
[22:36:23] Daniel J. Cutter: /me Chuckles "Of course I am rising up...Can't wear the armband without it..."
[22:36:40] Aurelio Grau: We just need more containers.
[22:36:53] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: absolutely
[22:37:14] Otto Von Habsburg: /me whitles to the tune of the Star Spangled Banner while waiting, looking straight at the door.
[22:37:14] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Oh, check this out.
[22:37:15] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: First record.
[22:37:21] Ethan King: /me chuckled along with the man, leaning back against the wall behind him. His gear would shuffle slightly as he dusted himself off lightly, sighing. - "It's a tiring day, truly. I can only hope my messages to the masses have helped inspire us to rise up."
[22:37:23] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: /me places the note down.
[22:37:25] Daniel J. Cutter to admins: Q question, how long is a CP training?
[22:37:32] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: /pm cutter an hour?
[22:37:33] Ethan King: Though, doubt it.
[22:37:37] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris to admins: i forget ic an reply here
[22:37:42] Ethan King: You've a name, friend?
[22:37:48] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I said I would take it and protect it.

[22:37:56] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Well, transcribe it
[22:38:00] Ethan King: /looc why is my desk this 
[22:38:02] Daniel J. Cutter: Please, Call me...The Baron...
[22:38:03] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: /me would pin it to the wall.
[22:38:16] Aurelio Grau: Huh.
[22:38:16] Ethan King: Ah, The Baron? quite the name friend.
[22:38:32] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Definitely somebody who cares
[22:38:39] Daniel J. Cutter: /me Holds out his right hand for seemingly a handshake "Current leader of the Exiles"
[22:38:41] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Fuckin.. alright.
[22:38:43] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: So.
[22:39:01] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: we need something, preferably something we can see through, for this window.,
[22:39:13] Aurelio Grau: Yeah.
[22:39:25] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Containers..
[22:39:26] Aurelio Grau: Strong enough to ensure no one gets through.
[22:39:26] Stewie Lou: like this cp suit i found?
[22:39:30] Ethan King: /me stepped forward, grasping upon the mans hand and accepting the handshake. Firmly shaking it once as he spoke, his voice tired and raspy. - "At one point I was leading a resistance, though not much anymore."
[22:39:32] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: /me takes out a pen and begins writing on a piece of paper.
[22:39:35] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Yeah.
[22:39:44] Ethan King: I go by "King" usually, pleasure.
[22:39:44] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I've seen somethng in the... What's it claled.
[22:39:47] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Metropol
[22:39:47] Stewie Lou: had to kill someone for it
[22:39:52] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: The windows are barred.
[22:39:59] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I wonder how we can get our hands on those.
[22:40:00] Daniel J. Cutter: Well King...I'm glad to see another face around here I can...hopefully trust...
[22:40:03] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: If not jsut making it ourselves.
[22:40:08] Aurelio Grau: You want in the metropol? I got the keys.
[22:40:25] Aurelio Grau: Could take from the ICT.
[22:40:28] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: That's not quite what I meant, but are you fucking with me?
[22:40:31] Aurelio Grau: Nope.
[22:40:33] Otto Von Habsburg: /me waits patiently for the door to eventually open, eventually.
[22:40:39] Aurelio Grau: /me shows him a CWU card from his pocket.
[22:40:44] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: /plysearch grau
[22:40:46] Aurelio Grau: I'm a worker.
[22:40:49] Aurelio Grau: I work ICT.
[22:40:53] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Wouldn't that draw suspicion to you?
[22:40:56] Aurelio Grau: Nope.
[22:41:03] Aurelio Grau: ICT is inactive.
[22:41:12] Aurelio Grau: Doubt they'd notice.
[22:41:14] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Well fuckin A, let's get a look at what they have.
[22:41:27] Otto Von Habsburg: Hey there.
[22:41:33] Otto Von Habsburg: Nice operation.
[22:41:39] Otto Von Habsburg: You didn't follow my advice did you?
[22:41:43] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: .//spider-man?
[22:41:56] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Look, I appreciate it, but we were in a hurry, we needed a safer path for the moment. We're careful.
[22:42:00] Ethan King: /me went quiet for a moment, a light shake of his head as he let out a tired sigh. This man had seen things, it was clear, little confidence within him at this point. He'd lower his hand to his sides, the ambience of this pitch black sewer lit only by an ominous red light, dead silence only cut through via droplets of water and the occasional speech of a human being. He'd finally speak out. - "I can only hope you trust me, though I'm doubtful I'll be helping you in the true resistance."
[22:42:03] Otto Von Habsburg: Mhm.
[22:42:04] Ethan King: /looc wall of texts 
[22:42:06] Ethan King: /loco gang 
[22:42:08] Otto Von Habsburg: What you do here?
[22:42:09] Ethan King: /looc gang 
[22:42:09] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: .//faster path*
[22:42:18] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: A lot of knowledge is destroyed by the Combine every day.
[22:42:24] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: We try to counteract that.
[22:42:25] Otto Von Habsburg: So I understand.
[22:42:28] Stewie Lou: /looc reading
[22:42:31] Ethan King: /looc moment 
[22:42:45] Otto Von Habsburg: That's a good movement in itself, mind if I take a look?
[22:43:09] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: /me gives Aurelio a sideeye.
[22:43:17] Otto Von Habsburg: /me shrugs.
[22:43:20] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: /it Essentially asking, what do you think, with a look.
[22:43:29] Stewie Lou: /looc so the resistance thing is finally here
[22:43:37] Ethan King: /looc rebel gaming 
[22:44:00] Aurelio Grau: Eh. Don't know about takin' a look. Maybe if we got to know ya' better?
[22:44:20] Otto Von Habsburg: Sure, I've got all day. You like history right?
[22:44:20] Daniel J. Cutter: /me Would adjust his vest, a outline of what seems to be a armored vest underneath the CWU Suit, He would look down the eyes of "King" nodding slighty..."My friend, the True Resistance doesn't exist...Not yet anyway, we are around to ensure the future of humanity...Through any means...The true resistance will come, but it has not yet truly shown its face"
[22:44:34] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I'm a bit of an enthusiast.
[22:44:47] Otto Von Habsburg: Well I've got quite the story then, if you have the time.
[22:44:55] Ethan King: /me shook his head lightly. - "I can assure you, the true resistance has existed.... though I'm doubtful you've seen it in full force."
[22:44:58] Aurelio Grau: We are actually busy right this second. If we see you around, though.
[22:45:05] Otto Von Habsburg: /me nods.
[22:45:07] Ethan King: Though, maybe at this point it no longer exists 
[22:45:10] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I don't mind a good story.
[22:45:23] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: But we are busy.
[22:45:36] Otto Von Habsburg: No problem, sorry if I'm a bit forward for you.
[22:45:41] Stewie Lou: /looc then gordon comes in and saves the world
[22:45:46] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: It's a slow to trust world, no offense.
[22:45:48] Ethan King: /looc it was crazy
[22:45:54] Otto Von Habsburg: Back in City Seventeen, brings back memories.
[22:46:21] Daniel J. Cutter: /me Would nod his head slighty "I have seen the resistance movement in full force...It was...A blood bath what occured after....No trust in eachother...It changes people, Trust issues, Different ideologies...It would change a man..."
[22:46:32] Otto Von Habsburg: No, I understand fully. I'm sure you've got your background checks and stuff. Either way, good to know someone's trying to resist in their own way.
[22:46:42] Otto Von Habsburg: See ya around.
[22:46:45] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Chaos isn't the way.
[22:46:47] Otto Von Habsburg: /me stands up.
[22:46:47] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Yeah, see you.
[22:46:54] Daniel J. Cutter: And...There will be a point where everyone must pick a side...
[22:46:54] Aurelio Grau: I'm going to put a couple things away.
[22:47:00] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Alright. I'm gonna scout.
[22:47:02] Daniel J. Cutter: No matter if they want to...or not...
[22:47:09] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Oh, hey. If you ever get your hands on some radio parts.
[22:47:09] Daniel J. Cutter: You would eventually have to pick a side...
[22:47:13] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Let me know.
[22:47:21] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I saw what looked like a receiver.
[22:47:22] Aurelio Grau: Alright. All good now.
[22:47:23] Otto Von Habsburg: /me zips on a CWU Worker suit before moving on.
[22:47:34] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: If we can get more of those and a soldering iron, I might be able to set us up.
[22:47:44] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I vvas an engineer before.
[22:47:48] Aurelio Grau: Oh yeah?
[22:48:02] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Yeah, computer engineering.
[22:48:07] Aurelio Grau: Nice.

[22:48:46] Otto Von Habsburg: Bit dark for my tastes.
[22:48:50] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: .//i just made that up
[22:48:54] Ethan King: Yes... agreed, the most dangerous part of a resistance.. is a split, I've seen it myself, even added to the flame. But understand that humanity will have to choose between extinction and survival, and it is an undeniable fact that when faced with extinction, humanity will choose any alternative. Fighting each other and the Combine for survival, is certaintly one of them.
