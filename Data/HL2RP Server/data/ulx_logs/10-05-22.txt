[18:22:04] Aurelio Grau: That's right.
[18:22:12] Aurelio Grau: And you aren't either? What are you doing up there?
[18:22:20] Daniel J. Cutter: I'm breaking and entering...Same as you
[18:22:26] Daniel J. Cutter: So open up the front door for me...
[18:22:29] Aurelio Grau: I'm not breaking and entering.
[18:22:34] Daniel J. Cutter: Yes you are...
[18:22:42] Daniel J. Cutter: Why else are you in a EMPTY OFFICE
[18:22:43] Aurelio Grau: Oh okay. I guess you know me better than me!
[18:22:58] Daniel J. Cutter: You wouldn't be in the most valuable place in the city alone for no reason
[18:23:03] Daniel J. Cutter: So what else are you doing...
[18:23:06] Aurelio Grau: Uh-huh...
[18:23:10] Daniel J. Cutter: Please...Enlighten me...
[18:23:19] Jacob Desmone: /pm Stewie alright im at the grotto
[18:23:20] Aurelio Grau: You are lucky I don't have a request device.
[18:23:32] Jacob Desmone: You got the cases?
[18:23:33] Daniel J. Cutter: You ain't a CWU?
[18:23:37] Daniel J. Cutter: Last I checked...All of them got one...
[18:23:47] Jacob Desmone: /me The man leans on the table and starts assembling the pieces
[18:23:50] Aurelio Grau: Yup. I forgot mine at my place.
[18:23:55] Daniel J. Cutter: Right...
[18:23:59] Jacob Desmone: I need one thing from the back really quickly
[18:24:01] Daniel J. Cutter: Open the front door so I can come in...
[18:24:03] Aurelio Grau: Nah.
[18:24:09] Daniel J. Cutter: Welp...I tried
[18:24:20] Daniel J. Cutter: /me Would raise his crowbar, slamming it against the window sending glass shards into the room
[18:24:25] Aurelio Grau: Jesus!
[18:24:28] Daniel J. Cutter: Guess the hardway..
[18:24:36] Aurelio Grau: Good luck getting through those bars!
[18:24:38] Daniel J. Cutter: /me Would put the crowbar against the top of the window

[18:24:58] Jacob Desmone: Apprently im missing some components
[18:24:58] Daniel J. Cutter: /me Would begin to pull against it, attempting to rip it out of its place
[18:25:02] Daniel J. Cutter: /rollattribute strength
[18:25:06] Jacob Desmone: But im close
[18:25:09] Daniel J. Cutter: /it The crowbar would slip
[18:25:09] Aurelio Grau: Yup. I'm outta' here.
[18:25:10] Stewie Lou: what'ca need i might have it
[18:25:11] Jacob Desmone: To making some radios
[18:25:15] Jacob Desmone: RF Recievers
[18:25:31] Stewie Lou: i dont have those
[18:25:33] Jacob Desmone: Yea
[18:25:36] Jacob Desmone: Hard to get
[18:25:52] Jacob Desmone: I can find some probably
[18:25:54] Jacob Desmone: Ill just have to look
[18:25:59] Jacob Desmone: // What can give RF Recievers
[18:26:02] Jacob Desmone: // Or how do i make em
[18:27:19] Jacob Desmone: Im not sure but anything eletronics
[18:27:21] Jacob Desmone: Bring it by me
[18:27:24] Jacob Desmone: Think about it this way
[18:27:31] Jacob Desmone: If it can Recieve a Signal to do something
[18:27:33] Jacob Desmone: It has a reciever
[18:27:38] Stewie Lou: hm
[18:27:43] Jacob Desmone: So per say the music here has a Transmitter
[18:27:50] Jacob Desmone: When I press the button the Transmitter
[18:27:53] Jacob Desmone: Hits the Reciever
[18:27:56] Jacob Desmone: And plays the sound
[18:28:04] Jacob Desmone: I have The Transmitter
[18:28:09] Jacob Desmone: Just the Reciever is the problem
[18:28:24] Stewie Lou: i could try to find something with a reciever in it
[18:28:34] Jacob Desmone: Good luck cause if you can I can make 3 radios out of it
[18:28:38] Jacob Desmone: And that will help
[18:28:44] Stewie Lou: oh it will
[18:28:51] Jacob Desmone: Anyway ill be in the back for now looking for some stuff
[18:28:55] Stewie Lou: alright i'll try to come back here as quick as i can

[18:37:26] Alex Palovichov: /looc A RF Reciever...
[18:37:31] Jacob Desmone: .// ye
[18:37:36] Jacob Desmone: .// 2
[18:37:47] Jacob Desmone: .// I can make a third one later I just gotta head to the other storage place
[18:37:51] Alex Palovichov: /looc I think Q said you would get those out of a radio...
[18:37:57] Jacob Desmone: .// Yea but im trying to make a radio
[18:37:59] Alex Palovichov: /looc Like a citizen radio
[18:38:03] Jacob Desmone: .// Citizen radio?
[18:38:03] Alex Palovichov: /looc Like the one that plays music
[18:38:11] Alex Palovichov: /looc Yes, they ain't illegal
[18:38:20] Jacob Desmone: .// Thats true but I would have to go around and find them
[18:38:28] Jacob Desmone: .// Can't I just craft the thing?
[18:38:41] Alex Palovichov: /looc pretty sure they are extremely small...
[18:38:49] Jacob Desmone: .// Scrap eletronics then idk?
[18:39:17] Jacob Desmone: /looc In eletronics I don't have to use the whole thing
[18:39:28] Jacob Desmone: .// Just the important parts
[18:39:36] Stewie Lou: // im back
[18:39:41] Jacob Desmone: .// Plus 90% of these crafting take Refined eletronics so I assumed
[18:39:48] Alex Palovichov: /looc No...Since they are extremely small and hard to create without finding...I'd consider that needing 65+ engineering
[18:39:58] Jacob Desmone: .// Like the RF Transmitter I can make with 40 engineering and refined 
[18:40:11] Jacob Desmone: .// And the Transreciever
[18:40:14] Jacob Desmone: .// I can make with 45
[18:40:20] Alex Palovichov: /looc The transmitter you yank out of a request device...
[18:40:27] Jacob Desmone: .// Yea and upgraded it
[18:40:37] Alex Palovichov: /looc yeah cause most of its already made for you
[18:40:52] Jacob Desmone: /looc I guess if you want it that way I can put this back
[18:40:56] Jacob Desmone: .// So Citizen radios right?
[18:40:56] Alex Palovichov: /looc Both are extremely small, The RF reciever is itself extremely small
[18:40:59] Alex Palovichov: /looc corrcet

[18:41:58] Stewie Lou: /pm jacob ?
[18:42:03] Jacob Desmone: /pm stewie yea
[18:42:08] Jacob Desmone: /pm stewie they have recievers in em
[18:42:18] Jacob Desmone: /pm stewie I was told I Can dissassemble them for the reciever
[18:42:29] Stewie Lou: /pm jacob i think ik one
[18:42:38] Jacob Desmone: /pm stewie I know theres one in the sewer
[18:42:44] Jacob Desmone: /pm stewie and a few around town

[19:01:10] Alex Palovichov: We only give out a ICT suit if you're apart of it..

[19:01:44] Jacob Desmone: /me Holds out hand for the baords
[19:01:45] Aurelio Grau: I believe it was one of the higher ups in CWU.
[19:01:51] Alex Palovichov: Higher ups in the CWU?
[19:01:54] Aurelio Grau: Yup.
[19:01:55] Alex Palovichov: May you tell me which one?

[19:02:51] Stewie Lou: /y but it's a bit far

[19:03:51] Jacob Desmone: Give me a second
[19:04:04] Jacob Desmone: Also I found a second
[19:04:05] Client "Lildirtyharry04" connected.
[19:04:06] Aurelio Grau: When I first arrived here in the city, they were calling for people to join the Civil Worker's Union. With no LP required either.
[19:04:06] Jacob Desmone: Board
[19:04:07] Stewie Lou: here it is
[19:04:13] Alex Palovichov: Really?
[19:04:16] Jacob Desmone: /me Takes out screwdriver
[19:04:16] Aurelio Grau: So I said, sign me up!
[19:04:19] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: // CP is amazing I watch CPs every day
[19:04:22] Jacob Desmone to admins: Yo I found another radio can I do the thing
[19:04:24] Alex Palovichov: /me Would reach into his pocket taking out a request device, speaking into it
[19:04:25] Stewie Lou: lemme see if i got one more board in the back here
[19:04:28] Alex Palovichov: Just one second...
[19:04:30] Aurelio Grau: Go ahead.
[19:04:37] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: // Civil Protection is great
[19:04:38] Jacob Desmone: /pm Stewie I can't go in there for some reason

[19:05:20] Jacob Desmone: /me Starts working at the Radio looking for the reciever
[19:05:21] Stewie Lou: /supplies
[19:05:26] Aurelio Grau: Really? Where does it say that?
[19:05:28] Alex Palovichov: Still strange why you would enter the ICT HQ unannounced...
[19:05:29] Client "Lildirtyharry04" spawned in server <STEAM_0:0:247487472> (took 84 seconds).
[19:05:33] Aurelio Grau: I don't think it does.
[19:05:39] Aurelio Grau: It really doesn't.
[19:05:44] Jacob Desmone: Many Thanks
[19:05:44] Stewie Lou: /me places the circuit board next to the radio
[19:05:46] Alex Palovichov: Well...ICT Requires applications for each person...
[19:05:51] Alex Palovichov: So we'll be filling one out...
[19:05:56] Jacob Desmone: /me Keeps poking and prodding for the reciever
[19:05:59] Stewie Lou: no problem
[19:06:01] Aurelio Grau: Clearly if it does, then our superiors would have required it.
[19:06:05] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: What?
[19:06:08] Alex Palovichov: I am your superior...
[19:06:12] Aurelio Grau: I said OUR.
[19:06:19] Aurelio Grau: You have superiors, too.
[19:06:22] Jacob Desmone: .// just waiting on da man
[19:06:31] Jacob Desmone: .// So I can do the roll
[19:06:37] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: I am superiorly annoyed I even had to come to work today.
[19:06:38] Alex Palovichov: Wonderful...May you check his data...see how many LP and if he has any level 5+ crimes?
[19:06:45] Lildirtyharry04<STEAM_0:0:247487472> changed their name to John Reece
[19:06:48] Alex Palovichov: Cause I gotta re-do his application...
[19:06:52] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: He's in your branch.
[19:06:58] Jacob Desmone: .// hes in a thing rn
[19:07:06] Jacob Desmone: You can go do what you want im fine here
[19:07:07] Dropped "John Reece" from server<STEAM_0:0:247487472>
[19:07:09] Stewie Lou: /looc for a new guy?
[19:07:14] Stewie Lou: /looc op they left lmao
[19:07:18] Jacob Desmone: .// nah hes just harrassing CWU boy
[19:07:20] Jacob Desmone: .// lol
[19:07:24] Alex Palovichov: Which is true...But he doesn't have an application for the ICT...He has a ICT suit...Doesn't know who hired him...Nor any mention of his name in my books...
[19:07:36] Jacob Desmone: They make every one of these radios different...
[19:07:41] Jacob Desmone: /me Keeps looking
[19:07:42] Jacob Desmone: Its small as hell
[19:07:46] Aurelio Grau: Our superiors got me in with non of that.
[19:07:48] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: That goes through Civil Workers Union administration, not you.
[19:07:49] Alex Palovichov: Which technically means...He isn't in the ICT without all of that...
[19:07:53] Jacob Desmone: But they make these things in those cheap ass factories
[19:07:57] Alex Palovichov: I handle ICT applications!
[19:08:01] Jacob Desmone: So all of them assemble this shit differnt
[19:08:02] Jacob Desmone: different
[19:08:07] Alex Palovichov: It says right on the handbook...
[19:08:14] Alex Palovichov: I handle the applications...do entry quizes...
[19:08:15] Stewie Lou: dont children work in those factories?
[19:08:19] Jacob Desmone: Probably
[19:08:21] Alex Palovichov: Enforce the requirements...
[19:08:24] Jacob Desmone: With wires and work like these
[19:08:33] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: I'm certain he was brought in by someone higher than you. Someone in CWU administration.
[19:08:35] Jacob Desmone: Probably made by animals
[19:08:43] Jacob Desmone: Just let a antlion get in
[19:08:44] Alex Palovichov: But why wouldn't he have ANY of the paper required...
[19:08:46] Jacob Desmone: and make it at this rate
[19:08:52] Jacob Desmone: /me Keeps prodding for the transmitter
[19:08:57] Alex Palovichov: Including the important...You know...application papers...
[19:08:58] Jacob Desmone: They might of not labeled it this time
[19:08:59] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Civil Workers were short staffed?
[19:09:06] Jacob Desmone: The one in the CZ had a label so I just plucked it out
[19:09:15] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: People can get hired without the process depending on the situation.
[19:09:16] Alex Palovichov: Last I checked...The ICT didn't give out jobs any time soon
[19:09:23] Aurelio Grau: This was way long ago.
[19:09:24] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Maybe he was here before you.
[19:09:29] Aurelio Grau: I was, actually!
[19:09:44] Alex Palovichov: So...Can I get his info so I can write down his application paper...
[19:09:52] Aurelio Grau: I ain't doin' it,
[19:09:55] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: You can ask him for his information.
[19:10:02] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: I already wasted enough time here.
[19:10:05] Alex Palovichov: I can't check if he has any crimes...
[19:10:10] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: He doesn't
[19:10:13] Alex Palovichov: Thank you...
[19:10:17] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /me walks away.
[19:10:20] Alex Palovichov: How many loyalist points do you have...
[19:10:32] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /viewdata grau
[19:10:32] Aurelio Grau: I'm not sure. Enough for a loyalist ration, though!
[19:10:36] Jacob Desmone to admins: uhh just tell me once your not busy or if you want I can just roll and you can give me it later
[19:10:40] Alex Palovichov: That doesn't tell me much...

[19:14:16] Stewie Lou: hm, alright
[19:14:16] Aurelio Grau: But you are my superior.
[19:14:18] Jacob Desmone: It allows me to get better at making shit anyway
[19:14:19] Alex Palovichov: So as long as you're in my branch...You gotta go under my rules...
[19:14:33] Alex Palovichov: Just cause I'm your superior doesn't mean I deal with another branch...
