[21:51:56] Charles Perway: Defenses didn't stand a chance.
[21:52:01] Charles Perway: We were researching that big motherfucker out there.
[21:52:08] Brandon Miller: what did you learn
[21:52:11] John Smith: i noticed that you all didn't stand a chance
[21:52:24] Charles Perway: Antlions are the one thing the Combine fears, and for good reason.
[21:52:24] John Smith: given the fact that you seem to be the only ones left
[21:52:32] Charles Perway: Yeah, we really didn't.

[21:53:31] Charles Perway: We've got some weapons around here from weapons research.
[21:53:46] Charles Perway: We were mainly trying to figure out how to defend against these guys, testing our weapons at the same time as learning about antlions.
[21:53:52] Charles Perway: There's some strange variants out here.
[21:54:00] Brandon Miller: yes I saw some
[21:54:05] John Smith: like the big fucker out there?
[21:54:10] Charles Perway: That one.. boy oh boy.
[21:54:17] Charles Perway: That one is what we called the antlion king.
[21:54:35] Charles Perway: Research implies there's a bunch of antlions protecting it.
[21:55:02] Charles Perway: But something that big must have something pretty good.
[21:55:09] Charles Perway: We've got a lot of things, mainly controversial, but hey.
[21:55:16] Charles Perway: Gotta break a few eggs, right?
[21:55:19] Charles Perway: Glory to the Combine.
[21:55:20] Charles Perway: Heh.
[21:55:27] Charles Perway: Please don't kill me if you guys are anti-union.
[21:55:38] Charles Perway: Because... I just realized I'm outnumbered.

[21:55:59] Brandon Miller: neither am I
[21:56:00] Charles Perway: But hey, since I've got the extra hands, who wants to kill a space worm?
[21:56:02] Charles Perway: Fantastic.

[21:56:15] Brandon Miller: lets do it!
[21:56:18] Charles Perway: Fantastic.
[21:56:27] Charles Perway: Alright, so, first up, we need to get to the weapons.
[21:56:29] Charles Perway: That's step one.
[21:56:33] Charles Perway: Then some armor, of course./
[21:56:37] Brandon Miller: could we electrocute it?
[21:56:40] John Smith: // we for some reason we hear Thunderstruck in the background
[21:56:44] Brandon Miller: maybe with a power line and a breaker box
[21:57:05] Charles Perway: I've got some other ideas.
[21:57:10] Charles Perway: Remember, this is a research facility.
[21:57:19] Charles Perway: Trust me, we've got much better than primitive technology.
[21:57:30] Charles Perway: First thing's first, though, let's get some of those Combine weapons.
[21:57:32] John Smith: we'd need a lot of power to kill something THAT big, remember, its the Amps, not the Volts that kill you.
[21:57:40] Brandon Miller: right
[21:57:47] Charles Perway: Thank GOD, somebody knows it's not necessarily the voltage that's the killer.

[22:19:02] Charles Perway: /it The terminal would switch to the view a Shield Scanner.
[22:19:13] Brandon Miller: a sea creature!
[22:19:13] Charles Perway: /it Synth scanner, that's the word.
[22:19:25] Brandon Miller: some kind of undersea molusk....
[22:19:35] Brandon Miller: what use is an undersea molusk to us?
[22:19:37] Charles Perway: //no, like you're seeing waht the scanner sees
[22:19:43] Charles Perway: /it It's the wasteland outside of the facility.
[22:19:43] Brandon Miller: // oh
[22:19:49] Charles Perway: so, you see that crevasse down there?
[22:19:55] Charles Perway: Not quite a ravine, but there's a noticeable dip?
[22:19:57] Brandon Miller: why would you put a camera in a bird...
[22:20:00] Brandon Miller: thats absurd!
[22:20:03] Charles Perway: That's a scanner.
[22:20:06] Brandon Miller: oh
[22:20:08] Charles Perway: There's a big power cord we need to get reattached.
[22:20:11] Charles Perway: Now, it's not a big plug.
[22:20:24] Charles Perway: Rather, it's a station that got fucked over. Big hydraulic plug.
[22:20:25] John Smith: you see scanners constantly in the City, how do you not know about them?
[22:20:41] Charles Perway: We gotta get that reconnected.
[22:20:53] Brandon Miller: alright
[22:20:55] Charles Perway: Then, we need to locate the pod with the power source.
[22:21:06] Charles Perway: We've got three others, but we need the fourth to pack a hell of a punch.
[22:21:19] Charles Perway: We're not sure where it is, but hopefully we can find it when we get to the power source.
[22:21:22] Brandon Miller: right
[22:21:24] Charles Perway: Cross that bridge when we get htere.
[22:21:45] Brandon Miller: /me irresponsably fires his gun in excitement
