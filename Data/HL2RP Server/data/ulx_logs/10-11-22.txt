[20:24:48] Jacob Desmone: Yea report them if they are seen without those binder thingys right
[20:24:50] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: So, those things have to live differently from us humans.
[20:24:59] Jacob Desmone: Insane tech by the way
[20:25:05] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /r In front of the RDT, intersection of collation and distribution.
[20:25:12] Jacob Desmone: Oh yea your nexus whatever it was called like radio thingy up in the industrial zone

[20:25:42] Jacob Desmone: I got it all nice and clean and fixed
[20:25:52] Jacob Desmone: It just needs a new capicitator so it doesn't overheat again
[20:26:06] Jacob Desmone: Your medic guy is pretty smart too with that kind of stuff
[20:26:10] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /me looks over at the HELIX and quickly utters 'Forming PT Hero".
[20:26:18] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /me mutters under his breath.
[20:26:19] Jacob Desmone: Alright well it seems you guys are gonna get busy
[20:26:24] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Hmm. Good on him for keeping it maintained .

[20:26:38] Jacob Desmone: Hes a good officer man
[20:26:38] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: They cleaned it up, not me.
[20:26:43] Jacob Desmone: Nah you helped me find the problem
[20:26:47] Jacob Desmone: I was looking and looking

[20:28:40] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /me would mutter an insult
[20:28:43] Jacob Desmone: It went down the stairs
[20:28:46] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Behind you.

[20:29:08] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Eh, doesn't matter.
[20:29:24] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: You make sure to be careful around those things. There's a reason they live like they do.
[20:29:25] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /toggleraise
[20:29:38] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Several, really.

[20:30:09] Jacob Desmone: What are they?
[20:30:13] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: Blasphomous technology
[20:30:27] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /actlean
[20:30:31] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Heavy units? What do you mean?
[20:30:33] Jacob Desmone: Like when I did work one time they brought me to the sewer to jack some old machines that were going out of date
[20:30:35] Jacob Desmone: Uhh smgs
[20:30:37] Jacob Desmone: Heavier tone
[20:30:48] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: The ones that wear those.. rubber suits?
[20:30:50] Jacob Desmone: Like he said the words
[20:30:50] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /w The grunts.

[20:31:22] Jacob Desmone: Just curious
[20:31:32] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /mey would turn around at the yell.
[20:31:32] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Those guys are part of the OTA. Essentially the military backing behind the CCA.
[20:31:34] Jacob Desmone: Like heavy armor rubber suits
[20:31:34] Jacob Desmone: Yea
[20:31:37] Jacob Desmone: Ohhh
[20:31:42] Sona la Rona: fucking hell
[20:31:44] Sona la Rona: i hate stairs
[20:31:45] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: In an old world context, the CCA would be the police. The OTA would be the national guard or the army.
[20:31:49] Jacob Desmone: That makes sense yea uhh they don't have alot of 
[20:31:53] Jacob Desmone: Object permanace?
[20:31:57] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: The feeling  is... mutual
[20:32:02] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Pardon?
[20:32:04] Sona la Rona: mhm
[20:32:10] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /ooc I don't got access to voicelines as vort

[20:32:30] Jacob Desmone: They seem clunky yknow?
[20:32:39] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Hm. i'll have to let someone know about that.
[20:32:49] Jacob Desmone: Yea like a zombie dropped a grenade and he just tanked it yknow?
[20:32:58] Sona la Rona: // /me would be in a silly goofy mood and start attacking the CPs
[20:32:58] Jacob Desmone: Same thing with crawler zombies
[20:32:58] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Nice.
[20:33:06] Jacob Desmone: He just kinda ignored it I had to kill one or two
[20:33:13] Jacob Desmone: Was weird.
[20:33:13] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Hm. Interesting.
[20:33:50] Sona la Rona: // k imma get off by
[20:33:53] Dropped "Sona la Rona" from server<STEAM_0:1:429480781>

[20:34:12] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: facinating
[20:34:19] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Those guys tend to be the hazmat units. They work with infestation control frequently, but they also serve as muscle in more infested areas.
[20:34:26] Jacob Desmone: Yea I can tell
[20:34:27] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /looc Mispelt it but fuck you
[20:34:29] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Sometimes they're sent out for recon.
[20:34:30] Jacob Desmone: He had really good aim
[20:34:34] Jacob Desmone: And everything
[20:34:38] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Fascinating
[20:34:39] Jacob Desmone: Just like the awareness was
[20:34:39] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Yeah, they're pretty skilled with guns.
[20:34:43] Jacob Desmone: Weird
[20:34:44] Jacob Desmone: Robotic
[20:34:53] Jacob Desmone: Like a human but yknow just modified?
[20:34:55] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Eh. They're still part human. Humans aren't perfect.
[20:34:59] Jacob Desmone: True
[20:35:07] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: The T in OTA stands for transhuman.
[20:35:12] Jacob Desmone: The hell is the alien thing doing?
[20:35:25] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: That's not what I signed up for.
[20:35:26] Jacob Desmone: They seem to not like yo uguys.
[20:35:29] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Eh. Getting familiar with the city.
[20:35:37] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: No, they don't, generally.
[20:35:43] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: The union branding... entities... interesting...
[20:35:53] Jacob Desmone: Probably got attacked for being a bit different yknow
[20:35:55] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: They have a history from long before any of us were born, the Combine has run into them before.
[20:36:00] Jacob Desmone: Ahh ok
[20:36:05] Jacob Desmone: Offworld type stuff
[20:36:09] Jacob Desmone: like the announcement
[20:36:15] Jacob Desmone: what was it
[20:36:21] Jacob Desmone: Relocation offworld something something
[20:36:53] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /me yawns into the vocoder.
[20:37:07] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: The Combine encountered them in its.. travels, and they were pretty resistant to them.
[20:37:14] Jacob Desmone: makes sense
[20:37:31] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Believe what you want
[20:37:46] Jacob Desmone: Alright well I might have to go clock in again my breaks almost over
[20:37:49] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Of course, we came out dominant, but they managed to escape us before we could fully subdue their kind, and then we reencountered them... three years ago. Same time we found humanity.
[20:37:53] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: We in the sense of the Combine.
[20:37:59] Jacob Desmone: Yea that makes sense
[20:38:01] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Yeah, keep things running.
[20:38:03] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: The overwatch speakswww
[20:38:13] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Careful around those things
[20:38:13] Jacob Desmone: If you ever want a drink or food
[20:38:15] Jacob Desmone: come on down
[20:38:21] Jacob Desmone: Can those aliens eat food even?
[20:38:23] Jacob Desmone: Hey!
[20:38:31] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /me turns toward the man
[20:38:31] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: Yeah, they're.. omnivorous I think?

[20:38:40] Jacob Desmone: /me Hands out a bag with some UU branded chips
[20:38:47] Jacob Desmone: salt flavour
[20:38:52] Jacob Desmone: pretty good
[20:38:55] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: That's how chips work.
[20:39:02] Jacob Desmone: Yea well you guys named them that
[20:39:06] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /w If you give a mouse a cookie...
[20:39:08] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /me hesitantly looks toward the bag... He reaches his claws out, taking the bag.
[20:39:18] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /w Tell me about it.
[20:39:24] Jacob Desmone: You gonna eat them?
[20:39:28] Jacob Desmone: Or you jsut want the bag
[20:39:57] Jacob Desmone: I hope this isn't toxic to them
[20:40:05] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: No, it's safe.
[20:40:17] Jacob Desmone: Yea good you know how if you feed a dog chocolate it dies
[20:40:19] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: They're not sensitive like dogs, I know that much
[20:40:22] Jacob Desmone: I hope its not like with salt and stuff
[20:40:23] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: .//psychic li nk
[20:40:24] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Just thought
[20:40:30] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /me would nod. He would open the bag by tearing a hole in it with his claw. Would look at its contents, taking a singular chip at eating it.
[20:40:40] Jacob Desmone: You can have the bag
[20:40:41] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: /rooc i am going to re-educate you

[20:41:27] Jacob Desmone: No problem.
[20:41:44] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /me would take the bag in his clawed hands, walking off and eating a few more chips.
[20:41:46] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Everything I hoped
[20:41:59] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Welp
