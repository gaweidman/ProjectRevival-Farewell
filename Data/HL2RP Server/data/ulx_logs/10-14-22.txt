[11:55:20] Nathan Pierce: /looc Hello there.
[11:55:23] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc bello
[11:55:33] Nathan Pierce: /looc hot looking vort
[11:55:39] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc yee. New models 
[11:55:48] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc Coulda done some crazy colors
[11:56:02] Nathan Pierce: /looc Pink vortigaunts would be puke.
[11:56:10] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc yeah
[11:56:25] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc Just decided grey vort with orange eyes would probably we best
[11:56:34] Nathan Pierce: /looc Wait, Black vortigaunt? GANGSTER VORTIGAUNT?
[11:56:52] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc Idk what that would look like. Probably terrible
[11:57:07] Nathan Pierce: /looc Yep, anyways
[11:57:14] Nathan Pierce: /looc I'm waiting for my Conscript whitelist.
[11:57:18] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc ah
[11:57:23] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc very good
[11:57:34] Nathan Pierce: /looc Gonna try to do a rogue one, if I manage.
[11:57:56] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc That would be interesting. You just have to make sure in RP you ain't tethered or tracked by the combine
[11:58:07] Nathan Pierce: /looc Yeah.
[11:58:21] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc Like, I would try to escape, but the stuff I have on tracks me and restricts me so
[11:58:28] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc no point if I just die 
[11:58:53] Nathan Pierce: /looc Well, I'll probably stay as a conscript until I reach Corporal.
[11:59:20] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc yee. The vort swep looks interesting
[11:59:23] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc has lots of stuff
[11:59:55] Nathan Pierce: /looc Yeah, all resistances in the server are non-existent or weak.
[12:00:01] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc one of the abilties is literally X-ray
[12:00:16] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc I can see through walls and shit and know the health of the enemy
[12:00:24] Nathan Pierce: /looc Hacks fr fr
[12:01:01] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc only issue when I escape is that I probably will need to think smart. Kinda hard. Because overwatch do be randomly coming out onto that beach
[12:01:34] Nathan Pierce: /looc It's hard to find a safe place to stay, most of us are wanderers when it comes to rebelRP.
[12:02:14] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc Yeah. I know of a spot I was told was a big no no because I just came across in randomly. They said I don't know. I was just clicking e and found it lol
[12:02:46] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc I thought the spot was pretty good to. Ill have to get invited into it I suppose
[12:03:04] Nathan Pierce: /looc I'll probably find a secret spot through doing random things like scavenging.
[12:03:14] Nathan Pierce: /looc So it won't be considered meta.
[12:03:17] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc yee
[12:03:57] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc Do overwatch log memories when they die? So they can keep coming? Or do they just have NLR like everyone else
[12:04:07] Nathan Pierce: /looc Most likely log memories.
[12:04:15] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc I feel like thats a little OP
[12:04:21] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc And unfair for resistance fighters
[12:04:45] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc I understand they can't "die"... But they should not be able to come wave after wave unless they escape and report it.
[12:04:57] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc but I guesss thats what the jammer is for
[12:05:01] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc so they can't report it
[12:05:04] Nathan Pierce: /looc Eh, I have a whole discord server set up incase I manage to form a resistance of sorts, though it will take a ton of time.
[12:05:27] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc Well... vortigaunts are always willing to escape and murder combine so
[12:05:40] Nathan Pierce: /looc Well, some are just loners.
[12:05:49] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc yee. Its how they survive
[12:05:57] Nathan Pierce: /looc yummy antlion meat.
[12:06:01] Nathan Pierce: /looc yummy headcrab meat.
[12:06:04] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc I don't need to eat or drink
[12:06:16] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc literally don't need oxygen 
[12:06:22] Nathan Pierce: /looc bruh
[12:06:24] Nathan Pierce: /looc lucky.
[12:06:26] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc I can last on the sheer will of the vortesince
[12:06:43] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc Its so nice not having to where A god damn rebreather 24/7
[12:06:48] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc wear*
[12:07:06] Nathan Pierce: /looc Hm, I've been wondering on what the resistance's name should be.
[12:07:24] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc just name it after some achievement the group makes
[12:07:32] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc don't give it a name until then
[12:07:49] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc Besides, If you gain norteriety early on, you become a big target
[12:08:09] Nathan Pierce: /looc  The first one I thought of was "The White Ravens" but now I'm thinking of naming it "The Freedom Coalition"
[12:08:27] Nathan Pierce: /looc Hm, but yeah.
[12:08:54] Nathan Pierce: /looc It's gonna be a pain getting a mental trigger so I can go rogue though.
[12:09:12] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc is the military treated?
[12:09:20] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc I thought it was only metro
[12:09:22] Nathan Pierce: /looc Yeah, all armed forces of the combine are.
[12:09:26] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc hm
[12:09:37] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc Well tbf your character can have a slavery background
[12:09:41] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc they bam.
[12:09:46] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc you see me, it makes you mad.
[12:10:07] Nathan Pierce: /looc So like, my character is insane (Kind of) right
[12:10:13] Nathan Pierce: /looc And they hallucinate this dude.
[12:10:19] Nathan Pierce: /looc Randomly.
[12:10:40] Nathan Pierce: /looc The dude comes up to me, (Close and personal) and begins whispering some shit into my ears.
[12:11:09] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc honestly, believeable because they literally took guys out of mental hostipitals and recruited them
[12:11:20] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc *3650* cough cough
[12:11:33] Nathan Pierce: /looc Nobody icly even knows that my guy is insane.
[12:11:38] Nathan Pierce: /looc He acts normal infront of people.
[12:12:11] Nathan Pierce: /looc so I would imagine that it would go something like this :
[12:12:23] Nathan Pierce: /looc One regular day, my char once again hallucinates that figure.
[12:12:47] Nathan Pierce: /looc The figure whispers something into the man's ears that makes him go insane and bang his head into the wall
[12:13:02] Nathan Pierce: /looc (In this case it would be, say. His past. )
[12:13:16] Nathan Pierce: /looc Then, the man wakes up.
[12:13:31] Nathan Pierce: /looc He's changed, reminded of who he is, who he once was.
[12:13:43] Nathan Pierce: /looc I don't know, but what do you think?
[12:14:34] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc Interesting. Something has to intitially trigger the event of being insane though
[12:15:02] Nathan Pierce: /looc Yeah, though the characters hallucinations happen at random at the moment.
[12:15:39] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc yee. If I escape, Ima see If I can just kill some antlions and then just carve the armor off them and just attach to myself using the vortesence
[12:16:10] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc Since I don't necessarily need to use human crafting for that. I can just use funny magic.
[12:16:16] Nathan Pierce: /looc Well, I wonder if vorts can free themselves.
[12:16:32] Nathan Pierce: /looc Under the right circumstances
[12:16:33] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc Doubt it. the collars probably will fucking try to kill me if I do
[12:16:40] Nathan Pierce: /looc Yeah, probably.
[12:17:03] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc Ik one boi has a master key that im hoping he will use eventually and just completely release the shackles
[12:17:31] Nathan Pierce: /looc Hm, what's that? 
[12:18:03] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc basically, it opens any combine door, lock, and releases vorts from there shackles
[12:18:08] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc its literally a masterkey
[12:18:41] Nathan Pierce: /looc pretty OP.
[12:18:43] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc He could literally walk into the central tower and raid the armory if he wanted to
[12:19:02] Nathan Pierce: /looc Though, does he just
[12:19:05] Nathan Pierce: /looc Uhh
[12:19:12] Nathan Pierce: /looc press a button or something and the shackles release
[12:19:24] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc idk. Never seen it. Probably. 
[12:19:33] Nathan Pierce: /looc Anyways, that's pretty OP.
[12:19:50] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc yee. Its an event item. He almost got caught, but he stashed it before he got searched
[12:20:15] Nathan Pierce: /looc Though I wonder what the proccess would be of doing it, a more simple way.
[12:20:56] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc im assuming he probably just has to hold the key up to my collar and it has some magnetic combine thing and it will release the shackles
[12:21:05] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc thats the only way I could think of it.
[12:21:17] Nathan Pierce: /looc Right, but like how would you do it without a key?
[12:21:44] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc probably would have to have a combine genetic code and or literally use a buzz saw and cut them off
[12:21:58] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc or another vort would zap and overload them.
[12:22:15] Nathan Pierce: /looc I think you would start off with the tracker chip
[12:22:26] Nathan Pierce: /looc which is probably implanted in your neck or somethin
[12:22:55] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc I could find it using the vortesence once im released
[12:23:02] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc its probably apart of the colalr
[12:23:32] Nathan Pierce: /looc Well if it's in the neck, then I would probably extract it and drop it off somewhere, not destroyed though
[12:24:05] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc well id have to be careful with extracting it. I would probably just smash it or disable it if its inside me
[12:24:09] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc safer bet
[12:24:31] Nathan Pierce: /looc I can see that there are wires on you, so they might be important.
[12:24:45] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc yee. 
[12:25:28] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc they are probably strong enough to withstand vortigaunt claw sstrike though
[12:25:44] Nathan Pierce: /looc Perhaps.
[12:26:07] Nathan Pierce: /looc I wonder if there are any free vortigaunts in this server though
[12:26:12] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc no
[12:26:24] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc even the owners character is enslaved
[12:26:29] Nathan Pierce: /looc well
[12:27:07] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc I would be the first. Probably try to survive to elder. Because I was talking with him about vortigaunts and what bonuses they get for reaching higher titles
[12:27:27] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc like a vortigaunt elder should be able to kick any combine that comes up to him
[12:27:45] Nathan Pierce: /looc Man, freeing vortigaunts is such a sweaty and risky job.
[12:27:57] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc Yeah. But they can heal and give you valuable intel
[12:28:07] Nathan Pierce: /looc Or, make friends.
[12:28:08] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc Super useful for fighting
[12:28:20] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc they can also power anything
[12:28:32] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc so ressistance basess basically have an infinite source of power
[12:28:44] Nathan Pierce: /looc Well, almost I would say
[12:29:09] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc Yee. Vorts get tired, but they still can power batteries and recharge them with vortesence energy
[12:29:30] Nathan Pierce: /looc Man, it's exciting to imagine large scale battles in the city
[12:29:43] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc oh yeah. It would be all out chaos. 
[12:30:32] Nathan Pierce: /looc Wanna hear a funny story of when I fought combine soldiers in a hl2rp server?
[12:30:37] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc sure
[12:30:44] Nathan Pierce: /looc So, I was once with my mate, right.
[12:31:01] Nathan Pierce: /looc We saved up a ton of TNT, and then eventually detonated it on a combine hardpoint
[12:31:24] Nathan Pierce: /looc After killing a couple CPs, OTA came in and we retreated to our base in the sewers.
[12:31:40] Nathan Pierce: /looc After we killed a couple normal soldiers and stuff
[12:31:51] Nathan Pierce: /looc 2 elite OTA  units assaulted the base
[12:31:55] Nathan Pierce: /looc However
[12:32:03] Nathan Pierce: /looc I thought of a big brain move
[12:32:23] Nathan Pierce: /looc While both my mates and the elites were focused on each other
[12:32:34] Nathan Pierce: /looc I did a huge flank
[12:32:40] Nathan Pierce: /looc And then when the time came
[12:32:48] Nathan Pierce: /looc I came in and killed the 2 OTA elites instantly.
[12:33:04] Nathan Pierce: /looc best decision of my life.
[12:33:11] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /
[12:33:14] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc yee. BRB>

[12:44:09] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc Yeah. Hopefully.
[12:48:34] Nathan Pierce: /looc I really wonder, what map would be on if this city would be destroyed
[12:48:43] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc im unsure.
[12:48:52] Nathan Pierce: /looc God, typos.

[12:49:13] Nathan Pierce: /looc Well, this is just an industrial city, supplying guns and stuff to the combine
