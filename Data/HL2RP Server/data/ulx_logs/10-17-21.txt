[20:09:23] Riley Suffat: /event The man is crying. His head is shaved, poorly. It looks ratty and hastily done.
[20:09:27] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: /me Would simply watch the horrific video and comment, "Who the fuck does this shit other than JUDGE? aren't rebels and shit supposed to be nice?"
[20:09:44] John Smith: who the fuck would do this in the first place?
[20:09:49] Anastasia Ivanovich: I do not think Rebels are doing this Officer.
[20:09:49] Riley Suffat: /event A JUDGE unit steps in from out of frame. He flicks on his stunstick.
[20:09:56] Anastasia Ivanovich: What do you know
[20:09:58] John Smith: ah.
[20:10:06] Anastasia Ivanovich: I am right again...

[20:10:31] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: Seems so
[20:10:56] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: Alrighty, well that was interesting.
[20:11:02] Riley Suffat: /event He looks bludgeoned and bloody. He's got boot prints on his clothes, burns on his face and hands, and scratches all over his chest.
[20:11:04] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: Still doesn't explain my armory fucking exploding.
[20:11:08] Anastasia Ivanovich: Officers- I believe this is being caused by Electrical Spirits. Is how you say in English?
[20:11:08] Riley Suffat: /event At least they look like scratches.
[20:11:08] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.23710: /radio Dispatch, can you shut down the holographic screens? They're showing things they shouldn't.
[20:11:18] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.23710 to admins: CCA.C08-GRID.i1.23710 radios in "<:: <:: Dispatch, can you shut down the holographic screens? They're showing things they shouldn't. ::> ::>"

[20:11:26] Riley Suffat to admins: oh, sorry
[20:11:30] John Smith: /me would get the chills, like something was behind him, and would promptly turn around.

[20:11:39] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.23710 to admins: nah i made the radio call like 2 seconds ago
[20:11:40] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: /me Would ponder at what Ana said for a second, before saying, "Well thats out of my control."
[20:11:41] John Smith: what the fuck was that?
[20:11:44] Dispatch/Overwatch teleported to CCA.C08-GRID.i1.23710
[20:11:45] Dispatch/Overwatch to admins: thank you
[20:11:46] Anastasia Ivanovich: I have a feeling-
[20:11:49] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.23710 to admins: just put it in admin chat in case you were too far away
[20:11:51] Anastasia Ivanovich: what was what?
[20:11:59] John Smith: it felt like something was behind me for a moment...
[20:12:06] John Smith: and before you say it
[20:12:10] John Smith: it wasn't the wall
[20:12:11] Dispatch/Overwatch: /radio 10-9, 23710?

[20:12:24] John Smith: no?
[20:12:25] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: Probably just jumpy is all, you did just see some fucker get tortured.
[20:12:31] John Smith: eh, fair
[20:12:38] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.23710: Is the city haunted?
[20:12:44] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: I wouldn't be that suprised.
[20:12:49] John Smith: not the first ghost I've dealt with.
[20:12:50] Anastasia Ivanovich: I mean- I saw a terminal earlier this hour make my head explode
[20:12:51] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: Too many people have died here.
[20:12:57] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.23710: i mean, we are in Japan
[20:13:01] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.23710: they have those funky uhhh

[20:13:22] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: Next a fucking Nine Tailed Fox is gonna pop up.
[20:13:26] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.23710: like the one girl with the mask
[20:13:33] Dispatch/Overwatch to admins: did you hear my response or is my radio tuned werong
[20:13:34] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: Can't wait, haven't shot a fox before.

[20:13:44] Anastasia Ivanovich: /me snapped out of it
[20:13:47] Dispatch/Overwatch: /radio 10-9, 23710?
[20:13:50] John Smith: /me would ponder what in the fuck they are talking about, and look confused as shit again.
[20:13:52] Dispatch/Overwatch: /me would proceed to tie the individual. Would they resist?
[20:13:52] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.23710: you could also not shoot endangered animals

[20:14:46] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.23710 to admins: ah yes, borderline traitorous stuff coming out of QrM's mouth
[20:14:55] John Smith: nah I'm pretty sure thats a fuckin nexus mate.

[20:22:19] Anastasia Ivanovich: we will do
[20:22:23] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.23710: we could go sit down and let someone else deal with this
[20:22:33] John Smith: I agree with that
[20:22:35] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: GRID, that is the shittiest idea I've heard in a while.
[20:22:44] John Smith: lets go watch more Godzilla
[20:22:50] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: Mostly because that means I have to get back to sitting in a dark room with a bunch of-

[22:07:25] Synthesized Voice: We had never though life through matter was possible.
[22:07:32] Synthesized Voice: We thought only energy could carry sentience.
[22:07:47] Synthesized Voice: But in your world, it seems we are unknown and thought to be impossible.

[22:08:11] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: // This straight us went from 10 to 1,000 within 5 minutes.

[22:08:46] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.23710: I have an idea
[22:08:53] Synthesized Voice: We are energy-based lifeforms.
[22:09:03] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.23710: I have this data recorder thing, you can go into it if I plug it into the console, right?
[22:09:18] Synthesized Voice: Energy on our own is not sentient, but much like you, when in the right configuration with the right specificity, it creates life. My people.
[22:09:24] Synthesized Voice: I may go wherever I wish.
[22:09:32] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: Then do you want us to take you with us?
[22:09:43] Synthesized Voice: I can go to the other end of your planet in a fraction of a section.
[22:09:49] Synthesized Voice: I want to go home.
[22:09:56] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: How do we get you there?
[22:09:58] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.23710: and how do we get you home?
[22:10:12] Synthesized Voice: Our people have experimented in your world...
[22:10:43] Synthesized Voice: We concentrate thermal energy into a single point, and with enough density, we can create a small hole.
[22:10:56] Synthesized Voice: in your human records, I believe these are called... a kugelblitz.
[22:11:10] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.23710: that sounds like a type of doughnut
[22:11:14] Synthesized Voice: A singularity of energy, as opposed to a singularity of matter.
[22:11:57] Synthesized Voice: We can channel matter and create these kugelblitzes, but we lack enough energy to do so reliably. 
[22:12:12] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: // THAT IS HOT

[22:12:42] Synthesized Voice: If you give us power, a very strong source, we may be able to harness it and return home.
[22:12:49] Synthesized Voice: Your people will be unharmed, and we may return home.
[22:12:59] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: Got any ideas for what could power you?
[22:13:13] Synthesized Voice: Your people have... a reactor.
[22:13:21] Synthesized Voice: One that channels dark energy.
[22:13:36] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: Sounds wild.
[22:13:41] Synthesized Voice: This may be our source, but it must be destabilized.
[22:13:52] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.23710: wouldn't that blow up the reactor?
[22:14:03] Synthesized Voice: Not if we harness it and prevent it from being violently released.
[22:14:08] Synthesized Voice: A violent release is a meltdown.
[22:14:21] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: Fair enough, if we can get to it I guess we could try.
[22:14:22] Synthesized Voice: If we use the energy before it can be released, your people will not feel a thing.
[22:14:32] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: Better than living some shitty life as a cop, might as well help your people.
[22:14:39] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.23710: how would we uh
[22:14:42] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.23710: get to the reactor
[22:14:52] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.23710: without being shot
[22:14:55] Synthesized Voice: You are close. If you can find the controls, you are welcome to try. Our people would be forever in your gratitude.
[22:15:02] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: I see
[22:15:11] CCA.C08-GRID.i1.23710: you able to give us a map?
[22:15:13] CCA.C08-QrM.98240: GRID, I'll go check that terminal outside.
