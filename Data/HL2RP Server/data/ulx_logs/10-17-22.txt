[16:55:00] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: Gotcha
[16:55:04] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Stand in front of the shooting range stalls, but not *in* them.
[16:55:14] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: And face opposite them.
[16:55:29] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /CHARGIVEITEM epu "radio"
[16:55:35] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: .// also I spawned with a gun

[16:56:07] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /CHARGIVEITEM epu "zip" 2
[16:56:09] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: alright..
[16:56:19] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /me comes out holding a radio, a strange device, and a couple of zip ties.
[16:56:26] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /me would hand them to the recruit.
[16:56:35] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: /me Would go out and grab the items and place them on his belt.
[16:56:51] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: .// u good?
[16:57:01] Lildirtyharry04<STEAM_0:0:247487472> changed their name to CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311
[16:57:01] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: .// did something get flung?
[16:57:07] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//yeah, no worries

[16:57:58] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Let's get startedf.
[16:58:09] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: First off is informational and dry. We'll try to make it not as terrible, but nobody like sit.
[16:58:15] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Still, you need to know this information.
[16:58:15] Felix Mahomer: Bullshit
[16:58:35] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: That said,  members of the CCA are divided into four divisions. These divisions determine that unit's side job.
[16:58:59] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: .// also I put in the same stats as my main character and traits and got less engineering on spawn and fabrication
[16:59:03] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: .// will that affect rolls?
[16:59:07] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//i actually know why that is
[16:59:09] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//wait
[16:59:14] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//you could have just transferred your char directly
[16:59:22] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: .// Yea but I wanna keep jacob
[16:59:25] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//oh my bad
[16:59:30] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: .// since I have like 50 engineering and stuff on him
[16:59:33] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: .// and a ton of loot
[16:59:40] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//it will but i know why. your character data is totally safe, it's an error with how it's displayed and calculated
[16:59:44] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: .// ohhh ok
[16:59:57] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//everything is fine on your end, i just need to fix up the game's co mmunicaiton
[17:00:05] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912:  With how big the CCA is, we need people to do specialized jobs. We need to fix people with holes and things with holes.
[17:00:06] Dropped "Felix Mahomer" from server<STEAM_0:1:54861900>
[17:00:39] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Everybody in every division goes on patrols, save for the very high ranked.
[17:00:46] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: /me Nods
[17:00:59] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The four divisions are as follows. UNION, GRID, HELIX, and JUDGE.
[17:01:12] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: UNION units don't have a specific specialty, you could say that their specialty is defense and sociostability.
[17:01:18] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Their only job is to patrol and protect.
[17:01:28] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: As a result, they get some pieces of equipment before other ranks.
[17:01:53] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: If there's, say, a riot, or a protest, UNION units would be the first to be called over a HELIX or GRID unit.
[17:02:08] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: But any of the other four divisions could respond. UNION are just the preferred ones.
[17:02:15] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: GRID are the engineers and handymen.
[17:02:29] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: APC needs an oil change? GRID handles it. Scanner acting up? GRID handles it.
[17:02:40] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The lower ranks do the more basic, easy jobs.
[17:03:04] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: I see.
[17:03:10] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Things like installing Combine locks, putting up barriers, things like that.
[17:03:34] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Higher ranks do the more advanced things, like working with complicated technology.
[17:03:51] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The highest ranks do the same, but can also initiate their own engineering projects.
[17:03:58] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Make sense?
[17:04:02] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: Yep
[17:04:07] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: Sounds like my type of thing
[17:04:13] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Fantastic, good choice.
[17:04:16] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Alright, next up.
[17:04:21] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: HELIX.
[17:04:32] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: They fix people rather than machines.
[17:04:43] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Low ranks put bandaids on scrapes, high ranks do open heart surgery. Make sense?
[17:04:48] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: Yea
[17:04:53] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: I'm exaggerating, but only slightly.
[17:05:06] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: Like ranks in a hospital
[17:05:06] Client "7 Days" connected.
[17:05:16] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Essentially.
[17:05:17] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: The more seniro doctors do more senior stuff.
[17:05:22] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Exactly.
[17:05:25] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: .// senior*
[17:05:45] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The highest ranks, like in GRID, can create their own research projects, normally in cooperation with GRID units.
[17:06:03] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: HELIX units can work with synths, as those are the unity of mechanics and living things.
[17:06:12] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: Ah makes sense
[17:06:14] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Those jobs tend to be restricted to the higher ranks.
[17:06:21] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: Helix high ranks sound scary.
[17:06:27] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: Start their own projects like grid.
[17:06:31] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: Would not want to make one mad.
[17:07:02] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Eh, we're not immoral, although it's pretty helpful for citizens to think we are.
[17:07:10] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: That's a good segue into our next topic, JUDGE.
[17:07:13] Client "7 Days" spawned in server <STEAM_0:1:17454649> (took 127 seconds).
[17:07:24] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: JUDGE units are the detectives of the CCA.
[17:07:55] 7 Days<STEAM_0:1:17454649> changed their name to Andrea Garcia
[17:07:57] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Common misconceptions are that they only do interrogations or torture. This is not true.
[17:08:13] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Part of having an effective CCA is having the citizens believe the CCA has power.
[17:08:15] Andrea Garcia to admins: admin on?
[17:08:24] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /pm andrea I am, but I'm doing training at the moment. What's up?
[17:08:45] Andrea Garcia: /pm  grid my super secret stash of contraband fell through the spawn train,
[17:08:59] Andrea Garcia: /pm epu a week ago
[17:09:02] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Could we extinguish extreme threats? Oh, absolutely, but that won't stop those extreme threats. They need to BELIEVE we're strong.
[17:09:05] Andrea Garcia: Ey.
[17:09:13] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: Right.
[17:09:13] Andrea Garcia: Damn, you can breath this air, huh?
[17:09:17] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: That said, JUDGE units are built up to be lunatics or deranged or psychotic. This isn't true.
[17:09:29] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: It's a myth that we don't care to dispel because it's far too valuable for us.
[17:09:37] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: The air quality is suitable for our species, yes.
[17:09:42] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Alright, next up
[17:09:49] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /pm andrea one second
[17:09:51] Andrea Garcia: Really? You guys must be pretty robust. Anyway, what are you doin'?
[17:10:26] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Right, JUDGE units. They're the ones who do investigations that are more complex. If a group of anti-citizens is being very evasive, JUDGE steps in.
[17:10:29] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: Wondering... thinking... remembering the my ways of my people to the best of my ability.
[17:10:50] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: They scrutinize details, are cunning, and put things together if need be.
[17:10:56] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Alright, any questions before we move on to ranks?
[17:11:00] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: None.
[17:11:05] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: My wardens prevent this though... through these shackles...
[17:11:06] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Fantastic. Give me one moment.

[17:11:29] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /ooc Yee
[17:11:33] Andrea Garcia: I see. I don't think I could help you out there, pal. You  got plans to remove 'em?
[17:12:19] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /pm andrea money case?
[17:12:30] Andrea Garcia: /pm epu inside is the i1 outfit
[17:12:41] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /plysearch
[17:12:41] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: I fear another "re-education". I wish to be free, but being free must come at the right price. My species will always distrust those that serve the combine.
[17:12:44] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /plysearch andrea
[17:12:54] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /pm andrea just reverse pickpocketed it to you

[17:13:11] Andrea Garcia: Uh-huh. You know, there are a bunch of shady fellers that lurk around the construction site. They could help.
[17:13:15] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//sorr,y had to do an admin thing
[17:13:17] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: //alright
[17:13:20] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: .// all good
[17:13:24] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Alright.
[17:13:28] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Ranks.
[17:13:34] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Ranks are broken up into four groups.
[17:13:43] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Ground units, field command, command, and high command.
[17:14:05] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912:  Ground units go from i5 to i1, going down as authority goes up.
[17:14:12] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: hmmm... perhaps I shall take a look one day. I fear I will put them into jeopardy... The shackles prohibit my power, along with a device to track the wearer no doubt.
[17:14:14] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: These units are who you find most of the time on the street.
[17:14:27] Andrea Garcia: Huh, interesting. Where's the tracker?
[17:14:33] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Field command ranks are EpU and SqL.
[17:14:53] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: These ranks also patrol, but have more authority than an i1. They're the people who give the most orders while outside.
[17:15:06] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: After that comes command. These ranks are OfC and DvL.
[17:15:07] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: I do not know... I feel it is within the shackles on myself.
[17:15:17] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: We'll get to DvL, that rank has a special part of it.
[17:15:30] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /pm 06912 Im assuming the shackles have trackers
[17:15:31] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Command units rarely leave the nexus, and never do so without some level of protection.
[17:15:38] Andrea Garcia: Hmmh. Well, I suppose your plan is to find like-minded people in the city, until a plan is formed.
[17:15:43] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /pm vortipode more or less. they're not extremely precise
[17:15:49] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: certainly
[17:15:54] Andrea Garcia: Alright. Best I head off.
[17:16:05] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /pm vortipode they could tell if you were outside of the city, but they'd have a very hard time dtermining if you were in the sewers vs if you were in an aparrtment building
[17:16:16] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: After that comes High Command.
[17:16:24] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: These ranks are very special. Commander and Sectorial.
[17:16:26] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: CmD and SeC.
[17:16:30] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /pm 06912 yee. I figured. I was wondering if I was just rambaling bolocks to the other person lol. I mean that is what vorts do.
[17:16:50] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: These ranks have no division. There is one of them per city.
[17:16:59] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: And there is one sectorial per sector.
[17:17:21] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Long story short, a sector is something to the scale of a country in the old world.
[17:17:46] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: A sector is the outlands, the combine bases in that area, and the city in that area.
[17:18:00] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: So, Nova Prospekt  is located in Sector 17, and therefore is under the command of Sectorial 1 7.
[17:18:17] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Inside of Sector 17 is City 17. This is what the commander controls.
[17:18:36] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: While on paper, the Sectorial has authority over the Commander, this authority is not talked about frequently.
[17:18:43] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: It's not usead.
[17:18:56] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Alright, any questions?
[17:19:00] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: Nope
[17:19:06] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Next up, quartermasters.
[17:19:25] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: These are their own special... "rank".
[17:19:29] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: QrM.
[17:19:43] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: These people are the armory operators, and if you're familiar with the United States military, ammo chiefs.
[17:20:03] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: They clean guns, manage armory inventory, manage living conditions, and assign different supplies to different functions.
[17:20:05] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Make sense?
[17:20:23] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: Yea
[17:20:30] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Fantastic.
[17:20:51] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Next up...
[17:21:03] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Sentencing.
[17:21:19] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: So, there are 7 levels of crime. The level corresponds to how the crime is punished.
[17:21:29] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Level one is the least severe, level seven is the most severe.
[17:21:45] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /actsit
[17:22:20] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: There are four ways to punish for crimes. Re-education, detainment, amputation, and sometimes political conscription, which is an alternative to amputation.
[17:22:45] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Detainment is jail time, amputation is death, and re-education is corporal punishment.
[17:23:08] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Level one violations are important to understand.
[17:23:36] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: They are there for units to punish only if needed.
[17:23:39] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: For example, running.
[17:23:44] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Running doesn't need to be punished every time.
[17:23:52] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: If you see somebody running down the street, that's not a huge deal.
[17:24:18] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: However, if you see somebody running down the street with a couple other people, or they're holding a blunt object, or they look suspicious in any other way, you have legal ground to tell them, "hey, knock it off."
[17:24:26] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Does that make sense?
[17:24:33] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: Yup
[17:25:00] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Re-education comes in four severities. 
[17:25:17] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: On the spot, minor, moderate, and major.
[17:25:39] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Those last three determine the wattage and number of hits. Those specifications can be found in your PDA's handbook, I won't go through them with you.
[17:25:42] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Those are too boring for even me.
[17:26:09] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: on the spot re-education is done without putting the citizen on the wall.
[17:26:15] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: You just outright hit them.
[17:26:24] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//on thje spot reeducation is what they do in half-life 2
[17:26:30] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: .// yee
[17:26:34] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//you still need to /me it, but you don't need to get them on the wall or anything
[17:26:52] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: When giving reeducation, don't hold back based on how they look physically.
[17:27:04] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: If they can't take the punishment, they shouldn't have done something worth re-education.
[17:27:18] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: If being re-educated does damage to them, that's their fault, not yoursl.
[17:27:22] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//this is one of those tihngs that has IC nuance
[17:27:35] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//being a little baby unit, a widdle baby boy who probablyt hasn't even popped his killing cherrry
[17:27:48] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: .// lmao
[17:27:53] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//you shouild probably show restraint when beating people
[17:27:58] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//based on their safety
[17:28:01] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//just for the sake of realism

[17:30:23] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: You can search anybody for any reason at any time, no matter what.

[17:30:37] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//again, OOC nuance, try not ot be a huge dick about it

[17:31:18] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: You could put it that way, although I wouldn't.
[17:31:28] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: Just I guess toned down?
[17:31:28] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: You want the security that the Combine gives you? You have to make a few sacrifices first.
[17:31:35] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: Yea alright that makes sense
[17:31:52] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Some of those sacrifices are old world notions of "privacy", something we should be moving past as a people.
[17:32:15] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Alrightr.
[17:32:19] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: so, contraband is obvious.
[17:32:28] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: You take it, you remove it from them, you punish for it.
[17:32:42] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Incinerate it, put it in your bunk if it's something cool and harmless.
[17:32:55] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Just make sure they don't havei t.
[17:33:05] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: However, you can confiscate things that aren't necessarily contraband.
[17:33:24] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: .// all the sparkling water will be mine

[17:33:53] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: If they seem to use it in a suspicious way, don't hesitate to confiscate i t.
[17:34:04] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Just use your own judgement, get it?
[17:34:15] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: Yep
[17:34:38] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: I wouldn't want someone to have a pack of nails if there's a person-sized crucifix in their apartment.
[17:34:57] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Alright..
[17:35:03] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Lastly, breaching.
[17:35:06] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: God help us.
[17:35:20] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: So, breaching. 
[17:35:31] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: This is done when there's a locked door, and you have reason to believe there's something dangerous behind it.
[17:35:46] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: It is not to be done any time you find a locked door or any time you open a door in a combat operation.
[17:35:58] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: I understand.
[17:36:33] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Alright.
[17:36:38] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: So, there are four keywords in breaching.
[17:36:43] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Stack, prep, lock, and inject.
[17:36:48] Dropped "CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311" from server<STEAM_0:0:247487472>
[17:36:48] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Stack means to form up on the door.
[17:36:56] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: In breaching ,there are two positions, linemen and breacher.
[17:37:08] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The breacher is normally the highest ranked one in the group.
[17:37:15] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: They stand OPPOSITE the handle.
[17:37:21] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: So if I were the breacher, I would stand here.
[17:37:29] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The linemen stand on the other side of the door.
[17:37:38] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Lined up back to back with their weapons.
[17:38:08] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: The first linemen is preferred to be the best armored in the group.
[17:38:09] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Anyways.
[17:38:15] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Stack is called, everyone lines up.
[17:38:22] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Prep is called, everyone takes out their weapon./
[17:38:33] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Loads it, turns off the safety, whatever you need to do.
[17:38:42] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Lock is called, the breacher shoots the door open.
[17:38:52] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Inject is called, the linemen enter.
[17:38:59] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Once all the linemen file in, the breacher goes in last.
[17:39:08] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Make sense? We're going to practice.
[17:39:13] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: Alright
[17:39:17] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: over here
[17:39:19] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: I'm the breacher.
[17:39:23] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Stack

[17:40:10] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /me would unholster his pistol and flick the safety off with his... (let me check my airsoft pistol real quick.)
[17:40:11] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: /me The man would unclick his weapon from his holster pputting it down in safe position
[17:40:21] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /it ...right thumb.
[17:40:37] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Lock.
[17:40:55] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /me would fire his gun at the door's handle, already with his aim focused on it.
[17:41:00] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: inject
[17:41:07] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: /me The man would burst in with his weapon at the ready

[17:41:14] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /me lowers his weapon as he walks in.
[17:41:22] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Normally, the breacher would keep his weapon out./
[17:41:26] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: .//their, sorry
[17:41:29] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: So.
[17:41:38] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: When going in, it's preferred for the linemen to pick a side to clear.
[17:41:48] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: So one checks the left, one checks the middle, one checks the right, for example.
[17:41:52] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: That's acceptable, but not mandatory.
[17:42:02] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: This would be organized before the breach by whoever's giving commands.
[17:42:14] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: You would be preferred to call out the word "Clear!" when scanning the room.
[17:42:15] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Make sense?
[17:42:20] CCA.C17-RCT.94233: Yes sir.
[17:42:25] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: Fantastic.

[20:44:41] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: It's a bit of a mess back here, but come on through. This is where I keep my tools and stuff.
[20:44:42] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /pm Union The tried and true tactic of talking to random citizens and making them feel weird
[20:44:46] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: It is fine

[20:45:03] Ava Carter: we've been talking about what happened in city 14

[20:45:27] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: .//void that 
[20:45:36] Ava Carter: well from what he said rebels just showed out of nowhere and started attacking the combine there
[20:45:42] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Cmon, you don't need to stand there.
[20:45:43] Alexander Lyam: yep.

[20:46:13] Ava Carter: yeah that union guy has been trying to get to that guy who has been throwing cans at him

[20:46:45] Ava Carter: he's quite fast
[20:46:48] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Understandable.
[20:46:49] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: /looc Im assuming that might happen

[20:48:27] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Maybe. It might be something the Combine has.
[20:48:32] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Seems like I've got to do something.
[20:48:38] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Something they keep in their factories.

[20:49:59] Jefferson Jackson: would you like some fish flavored food?
[20:50:01] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I wonder if the Industrial Corps could help me get my hands on these tools.
[20:50:02] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: I do not know much of bindings, but enough force can make a excellent tool. However, I belive these bindings to be made of composite combine material. The same they use in most of their craft.
[20:50:03] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: No

[20:50:31] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: The problem with using brute force is that you're living things. Brute force works great with locks, not so much on a living being.
[20:50:32] Alexander Lyam: Where do I get a new one
[20:50:32] CAC.C17-VORTIPODE.20311: Perhaps. The corps may not be as trusting however.

[20:56:40] Alexander Lyam: We don't necessarily need tojoin the rebels as I said
[20:56:46] Alexander Lyam: Combine may turn a blind eye toward us

[20:59:26] Ava Carter: and maybe others from the group the leader is quite smart
[20:59:53] Alexander Lyam: I dunno I don't really have problems with the combine unless they cross paths with us
