[14:00:26] Ava Carter: oh 
[14:00:34] PVT Nathan Pierce: Eh, though everyday I'm feeling like I'm on drugs.
[14:00:37] PVT Nathan Pierce: Because y'know..
[14:00:50] PVT Nathan Pierce: I get my head washed by The UU everyday.
[14:01:01] Ava Carter: like good drugs or bad drugs?
[14:01:49] PVT Nathan Pierce: I don't know, all I know is that they replace all bad things that I have experienced with the UU into good ones, so I'm not really so sure what to believe anymore..
[14:02:00] Ava Carter: huh
[14:02:40] Ava Carter: that doesn't sound... pleasant
[14:02:59] PVT Nathan Pierce: I trust the Combine, I think?..
[14:03:04] PVT Nathan Pierce: Err'..
[14:03:18] PVT Nathan Pierce: Well, I'm just confused. I don't even trust myself anymore.
[14:03:37] Ava Carter: why trust the combine they bassically took your memories away
[14:04:21] PVT Nathan Pierce: Well, it's to ensure loyalty. What's so bad about that? And besides, they didn't really take away my memories, they just replaced em'.
[14:04:48] Ava Carter: yeah sure...
[14:05:09] PVT Nathan Pierce: Anyways, I made friend with a vort yesterday.
[14:05:16] PVT Nathan Pierce: His name was uh..
[14:05:35] PVT Nathan Pierce: Qui'Jal, if I recall.
[14:05:40] Ava Carter: oh that guy?
[14:06:00] PVT Nathan Pierce: Well, a vort escaped that day. I hope it ain't him.
[14:06:22] Ava Carter: well i haven't seen him all day yesterday and today
[14:06:34] Ava Carter: so who knows
[14:07:03] PVT Nathan Pierce: And that makes me worried, it would be a shame if I had to kill him. He's a good bloke.
[14:07:20] Ava Carter: then why kill him
[14:07:25] Ava Carter: if you like him so much
[14:07:39] PVT Nathan Pierce: That's the point, I don't want to kill him.
[14:07:59] PVT Nathan Pierce: But, it's probably for the greater good. Isn't it?
[14:08:13] Ava Carter: trust your gut
[14:08:26] PVT Nathan Pierce: Yeah, if it was that easy.
[14:08:39] Ava Carter: i know you have to think about everything
[14:08:46] Ava Carter: your job your life the combine
[14:09:05] Ava Carter: i know it isn't easy
[14:09:15] PVT Nathan Pierce: I don't want to kill those rebels, or vorts..
[14:09:24] PVT Nathan Pierce: It's just that, both them and the Combine force me to.
[14:09:56] Ava Carter: if the combine force you to kill probably innocent people then why join the combine in the first place
[14:09:57] Ava Carter: i mean
[14:10:03] Ava Carter: you're a conscript
[14:10:20] PVT Nathan Pierce: They are people who think resisting will help us, they are not realizing that we are creating Unity.
[14:10:46] Ava Carter: creating unity with WHAT? killing the earth killing millions of people?!?!
[14:10:57] Ava Carter: it makes no since
[14:11:12] Ava Carter: /me would seem a tad bit angry but trys to calm down
[14:11:16] PVT Nathan Pierce: What?.. That's a lie..
[14:11:29] PVT Nathan Pierce: It's not them who killed humanity, it's the Xen wildlife and shit..
[14:11:55] Ava Carter: then why would a vort escape most likely joining the rebels or some shit?
[14:12:08] Ava Carter: and besides have you ever
[14:12:10] Ava Carter: EVER
[14:12:18] Ava Carter: looked up and see the death above you
[14:12:50] PVT Nathan Pierce: They are resisting, the Combine have no choice but to put an end to all resistance.
[14:12:58] Ava Carter: /me sighs
[14:13:18] Ava Carter: yeah yeah besides what do i know
[14:13:21] Ava Carter: i dont know you
[14:13:29] Ava Carter: what you've dealt with
[14:13:36] Ava Carter: i most likely cant change your mind
[14:14:22] Ava Carter: /me would look defeated
[14:14:25] PVT Nathan Pierce: /me took a deep breath, sighing
[14:14:45] Ava Carter: i just want to ask one question
[14:15:18] Ava Carter: why would the humans and xen life or whatever even be resisting if they knew that the combine are creating this so called "unity"
[14:15:29] Ava Carter: it makes no since
[14:15:46] PVT Nathan Pierce: They are blinded.
[14:15:51] Ava Carter: blinded by what
[14:15:55] Ava Carter: tell me
[14:16:24] PVT Nathan Pierce: They think that the Combine are enslaving them, but they are not.
[14:16:37] Ava Carter: that's rich
[14:17:04] Ava Carter: but how are they *not* enslaved huh?
[14:17:34] Ava Carter: i've seen it with my own eyes but tell me how they, WE are not enslaved
[14:18:36] PVT Nathan Pierce: Well first off they give us free housing, free food, extra if you work.. And they protect us from the Xen wildlife out there.
[14:19:14] Ava Carter: sounds like prison to me
[14:19:51] PVT Nathan Pierce: What? You want to go out there and meet some head hoppers? Some of those bugs in the outlands perhaps?
[14:20:11] Ava Carter: WERE YOU NOT THERE YESTERDAY
[14:20:17] Ava Carter: THEY WERE EVERYWHERE
[14:20:42] Ava Carter: plus at my last city they were almost so damn common to see they were almost considered fucking PETS
[14:20:53] PVT Nathan Pierce: That was an accident, and we controlled that accident. We protected the people.
[14:21:10] PVT Nathan Pierce: /looc F3 btw

[14:21:53] Ava Carter: /looc k
[14:22:17] Ava Carter: yeah you protected us so yall didn't lose any slaves that were valuable
[14:22:34] PVT Nathan Pierce: You awfully sound like a Rebel.
[14:22:45] Ava Carter: it's just my mindset
[14:22:54] PVT Nathan Pierce: A mindset of a Rebel.
[14:22:56] Ava Carter: if i was a rebel i would've been dead already
[14:23:24] Ava Carter: although i do admit
[14:23:27] Ava Carter: the combine
[14:23:30] Ava Carter: they're smart
[14:24:01] Ava Carter: and of subject
[14:24:05] Ava Carter: /looc off*
[14:24:34] Ava Carter: you're a conscript right? why are you working for the combine i thought conscripts were rebels and shit
[14:24:48] PVT Nathan Pierce: Who told you that?..
[14:24:54] PVT Nathan Pierce: We ain't no Rebels.
[14:25:15] Ava Carter: at my last city some conscripts were rebels
[14:25:38] PVT Nathan Pierce: Well then you saw defunct ones, traitors.
[14:25:48] Ava Carter: fair
[14:26:17] PVT Nathan Pierce: /me Looked up at the Green and lifeless sky, sighing yet once again

[14:27:15] PVT Nathan Pierce: Well, I don't know what made the air so shitty in the first place.
[14:27:41] Ava Carter: do you remember before the combine how beautiful the sky was all blue and full of life
[14:27:58] PVT Nathan Pierce: Yeah, so?
[14:28:20] Ava Carter: you remember after the combine came here after the war the sky became dead
[14:28:28] Ava Carter: dont you see some kind of connection?
[14:29:14] PVT Nathan Pierce: Pfft, the Combine wouldn't turn the air poisonous. Why would they do that?
[14:29:35] Ava Carter: to

[14:29:39] Ava Carter: us
[14:29:40] Ava Carter: off
[14:30:03] PVT Nathan Pierce: No, it must've been the Xen spores or something..
[14:30:17] Ava Carter: you think the xen spores really did this
[14:30:23] Ava Carter: how many do you think it took then?
[14:30:25] Ava Carter: 1?
[14:30:27] Ava Carter: 10?
[14:30:29] Ava Carter: 1000?
[14:30:39] Ava Carter: it's impossible
[14:30:50] Client "srankin184" connected.
[14:31:22] Ava Carter: the earth is so mother fucking big how would a few xen spores just kill the sky and poison the air?
[14:31:35] PVT Nathan Pierce: Anything is possible.
[14:31:59] Ava Carter: yeah just let me turn into a helicopter real quick wait, i cant because it's impossible
[14:32:20] PVT Nathan Pierce: If you tried hard enough, you just might. Probably.

[14:40:05] Ava Carter: he's just
[14:40:31] Ava Carter: it feels like half of his brain has been brainwashed
[14:40:44] Ava Carter: i feel bad for the dude
[14:40:47] Aurelio Grau: Huh. Sounds weird
[14:41:20] Ava Carter: he went from saying shit like "man it would be a shame if "vort name" escaped and i have to kill him"
[14:41:47] Ava Carter: or "the combine wash my brain everyday"
[14:42:00] Ava Carter: to just saying what you said pro union shit
[14:42:30] Ava Carter: i tried talking to him about how the combine aren't to be trusted how they aren't creating this "unity" he's talking about
[14:42:51] Ava Carter: tried to help him
[14:43:07] Ava Carter: tried to get to him but he's just ... gone i guess
[14:43:29] Aurelio Grau: Maybe. Though it's possible there's more to the picture.
[14:43:39] Aurelio Grau: Not too sure what, but maybe.
[14:43:47] Ava Carter: fair
[14:43:53] Ava Carter: i know nothing about the guy
[14:44:02] Ava Carter: only his name
[14:44:07] Ava Carter: and his job
[14:44:34] Aurelio Grau: Yup.
[14:44:56] Ava Carter: maybe next time when he's back on duty i can get to him
[14:45:34] Aurelio Grau: Possibly. All depends on why he's the way he is.
[14:46:17] Aurelio Grau: Though people with radical ideas are very hard to convince to pull a 180 on.
[14:46:42] Ava Carter: yeah i guess if i were to try it would need time to try to convince him
[14:47:15] Aurelio Grau: Try asking about where he's from. What he did before the war. The likes.
[14:47:36] Ava Carter: i guess i'll try that when he's on duty
[14:47:52] Ava Carter: well anyways

[19:05:03] Jacob Desmone: I know a another dude whos down
[19:05:11] Jacob Desmone: I will hand over the key
[19:05:21] Jacob Desmone: And let you raid the thing and keep any loot you find EXCEPT for combine eletronics
[19:05:25] Jacob Desmone: Those eletronics go straight to me
[19:05:26] Jacob Desmone: Got it?
[19:05:29] Ava Carter: yeah yeah
[19:05:33] Jacob Desmone: Any weapons you find
[19:05:34] Jacob Desmone: All yours 
[19:05:38] Jacob Desmone: I have a few guns in my base
[19:05:47] Jacob Desmone: A USP match and a 357 Magnum
[19:05:49] Jacob Desmone: But if you suceed
[19:05:53] Jacob Desmone: You can make it out
[19:05:58] Jacob Desmone: With some nice guns
[19:06:02] Jacob Desmone: I hear those things possibly have
[19:06:04] Jacob Desmone: SMGS Rifles
[19:06:07] Jacob Desmone: Conscript gear
[19:06:14] Ava Carter: huh
[19:06:17] Ava Carter: so where is this
[19:06:21] Jacob Desmone: Well theres a few spots
[19:06:35] Jacob Desmone: You can raid the train area for a CCA resupply
[19:06:43] Jacob Desmone: That would net you the highest gain but the riskiest
[19:06:49] Ava Carter: how so?
[19:06:53] Jacob Desmone: Well its a dead end
[19:07:00] Jacob Desmone: And cps are constantly processing people there
[19:07:05] Ava Carter: true
[19:07:07] Ava Carter: true
[19:07:10] Jacob Desmone: You can also raid the checkpoint near the front
[19:07:14] Jacob Desmone: It has less loot but nobody really goes there
[19:07:20] Client "Dilly_" connected.
[19:07:21] Jacob Desmone: Or you can raid the CCA resupply
[19:07:23] Jacob Desmone: In the hotel
[19:07:30] Jacob Desmone: That has the least loot but its the safest
[19:07:36] Jacob Desmone: I also have a short radio jammer
[19:07:40] Jacob Desmone: So they will not call for backup
[19:07:54] Jacob Desmone: And or let the signal of their death go out till you turn the jammer off or get out of there
[19:08:08] Ava Carter: mhm
[19:08:11] Jacob Desmone: I have a few things you can use as traps aswell if you are fine with setting those up..
[19:08:12] Jacob Desmone: Fuel cans
[19:08:14] Jacob Desmone: Tripwires
[19:08:16] Jacob Desmone: Grenades
