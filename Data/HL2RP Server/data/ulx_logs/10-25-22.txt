[20:51:03] Élisabeth Morel: // ello
[20:51:39] Paul-Henri Cartier: I doubt you've seen one. If you've had the misfortune of coming across an OTA, they usually wear that white jumpsuit. Big tank of air on their back?
[20:52:08] Kiff Sankase: Doesn't ring a bell, but nothing my axe couldn't solve
[20:52:51] Kiff Sankase: But I did see a cremator yesterday. Scared the hell outa me, I was bouta charge it with my axe
[20:52:52] Paul-Henri Cartier: Your axe isn't bullet-proof
[20:53:09] Paul-Henri Cartier: cremators are harmless, really. They just clean trash

[20:56:49] Finan O'Conall: /Y Just a fellow looking for trade.
[20:57:01] Paul-Henri Cartier: /me would shake his head, before tapping his vest. "Already have armour, level Three-A--" He'd say, before placing his hand on his holster, pulling the revolver out slightly.
[20:57:35] Finan O'Conall: /y If you'd like me to leave I will, however I mean you no harm.
[20:57:52] Kiff Sankase: /it The mans eyes are drawn to the weapon as he mentions it

[20:59:41] Kiff Sankase: Welcome!
[21:00:03] Finan O'Conall: /me points to the man in the CCA Uniform. "What's with the Uniform lad?"
[21:01:24] Paul-Henri Cartier: /me 's uniform would be the epitomy of unpristine, one of the lenses being cracked, most of the symbols on the uniform defaced or removed, the only one's being somewhat visible being labelled 'GRID' and 'i1'. "It's my clothes."

[21:03:42] Kiff Sankase: So you said you came to trade?
[21:04:01] Finan O'Conall: I've got two boxes of shotgun shells.
[21:04:17] Paul-Henri Cartier: "Do you, now?"
[21:04:19] Kiff Sankase: If I had a shotgun I would take them
[21:04:23] Finan O'Conall: Indeed.

[21:06:29] Paul-Henri Cartier: you know someone actually lives here, yeah?
[21:06:36] Ava Carter: // >:(

[21:06:54] Kiff Sankase: Someone would willingly live here?
[21:06:57] Paul-Henri Cartier: /me would point behind him with his thumb, at the sign. "An actual Vortigaunt. He's a nice fellow."
[21:07:02] Ava Carter: // i have a picture of paine using a toolgun
[21:07:24] Kiff Sankase: Vortal...Vortigant....Oh that makes sense
[21:07:42] Kiff Sankase: By the way, I'm Kiff
[21:07:57] Finan O'Conall: /me nods. "You?"
[21:08:15] Paul-Henri Cartier: "Paul-Henri."
[21:08:49] Finan O'Conall: Pleased to meet you both. Sorry for the nickname but without it I wouldn't be able to operate on the surface.
[21:09:07] Kiff Sankase: You still go up there? 
[21:09:18] Finan O'Conall: For certain reasons yes.
[21:09:49] Kiff Sankase: I couldn't imagine myself going backup, the fear of getting caught gets to me
[21:10:03] Finan O'Conall: Mm. That's exactly why I use a nickname.
[21:10:26] Finan O'Conall: Anyways- Paul you look like you may want some shells no?
[21:10:40] Paul-Henri Cartier: "Maybe I do. What do you want in exchange?"
[21:11:19] Finan O'Conall: To be honest if you're gonna use them to kill more Combine then I'll give you a box for free.
[21:11:57] Paul-Henri Cartier: "Well, I want to at least give you *something.*" He'd say, pulling an odd device with a screen and a touchpad on it, placing it on the counter.
[21:12:26] Finan O'Conall: /me approaches the counter and looks on at the electronic device.
[21:12:36] Kiff Sankase: That looks fancy
[21:12:42] Finan O'Conall: This would come in handy.
[21:13:08] Paul-Henri Cartier: "I'm not sure what you could do with it yourself, but it'll at least be worth something. Squad Identification Device." He'd say, before tapping his mask, "Connects to a HUD, let's you see member's of your squad through walls."
[21:13:19] Finan O'Conall: I actually have a target up on the surface to hit and being able to locate Protection Teams wouldd allow for easy access.
[21:13:43] Kiff Sankase: .// is it that one i5 lmao
[21:14:04] Finan O'Conall: .// nah I have a lot of gasoline i've been storing to cause somee infastructure damage
[21:14:11] Kiff Sankase: .// ah
[21:14:23] Finan O'Conall: Hm
[21:14:33] Finan O'Conall: I've got one rule though about this ammunition.
[21:14:44] Paul-Henri Cartier: "Hmm? And what's that?"
[21:15:31] Finan O'Conall: If you are going to use it on someone, it better be in good taste. No killing innocents and no threatening the innocents of the sewer. If you can agree to that I see no reason why I can't part with the box.
[21:16:00] Kiff Sankase: The killing no innocents part seems like a good deal I do say so myself
[21:16:20] Client "Dilly_" connected.
[21:16:21] Finan O'Conall: /me looks over at Kiff and chuckles slightly.
[21:16:21] Paul-Henri Cartier: /me would extend a gloved hand, "Of course. We have a deal, then?"
[21:16:42] Finan O'Conall: /me would grab hold of the mans hand with a shake. "You bet lad."
[21:17:10] Finan O'Conall: /me would pull his hand away and begin to rumage through his bag. He'd pull out an unopened box of twelve gauge shotgun shells.
[21:17:35] Paul-Henri Cartier: Very nice...
[21:17:55] Ava Carter: // DRD imma find ya
[21:18:03] Finan O'Conall: If either of you ever wish to help take the fight back to the surface don't be afraid to look for thee Serviceman.
[21:18:37] Kiff Sankase: I appreciate the offer but I'm content staying down here...for now at least
[21:18:45] Paul-Henri Cartier: // wrong
[21:18:50] Finan O'Conall: That's entirely your wish.
[21:18:55] Paul-Henri Cartier: "Will do, sometime or another."
