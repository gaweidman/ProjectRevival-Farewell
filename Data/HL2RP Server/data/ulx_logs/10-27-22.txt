[21:19:05] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: You are to take a pair of tongs, and scrap metal as well.
[21:19:13] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Once you have those, you move over here.
[21:19:21] Jefferson Jackson: /yell YOUR NOT GETTING ME
[21:19:49] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Right here is the forge, this is where you will smelt the metal down into molds which can cool into metal.

[21:21:12] Ava Carter: JEFFERSON
[21:21:12] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Afterwards you come over here when they are all cooled.

[23:02:06] Daniel J. Cutter: Indeed they are..
[23:02:09] Jacob Desmone: To make ammo.

[23:16:45] Ava Carter: anyways since i dont need this
[23:16:53] Jacob Desmone: My magnum I found
[23:16:56] Jacob Desmone: Gave it to ava cause
[23:16:56] Jacob Desmone: Yknow
[23:17:01] Jacob Desmone: I don't like guns
[23:17:11] Jacob Desmone: I know how they work and stuff just never liked em
[23:17:14] Daniel J. Cutter: We could have plenty more...Though the local Exile Connection to this city has been...Severed...After the "Battle of Jacob Station"...
[23:17:19] Paul-Henri Cartier: /me would reach into his pocket, pulling out a revolver speedload
[23:17:21] Paul-Henri Cartier: .// er

[23:17:34] Daniel J. Cutter: Ey, Jacob
[23:17:36] Jacob Desmone: Hm?
[23:17:46] Ava Carter: th- thanks dude
[23:17:49] Jacob Desmone: I have a idea.
[23:18:02] Jacob Desmone: /me Would set out the scrap metal on the workbench and start working
[23:18:04] Daniel J. Cutter: Lucky we had the Exile CrossBow Blueprint..
[23:18:04] Qul'jal: /looc oh. I created a light
[23:18:08] Qul'jal: /looc thats what that does
[23:18:11] Jacob Desmone: /me Would mold them into some kind of BOLTS
[23:18:20] Paul-Henri Cartier: Crossbow. How... middle ages
[23:18:21] Daniel J. Cutter: Thats mostly all I got given after the Exile Connection was...rudely destroyed...
[23:18:25] Jacob Desmone: /rollskill engineering

[23:19:00] Qul'jal: /looc I can't figure that one out
[23:19:09] Jacob Desmone: /me Would apply a bit of metal shaping the rest of the metal into a bolt like ammo
[23:19:12] Daniel J. Cutter: A shame we couldn't have more...
[23:19:15] Jacob Desmone: /rollskill Engineering
[23:19:19] Ava Carter: y'know jacob if you want i could teach you how to use guns properly
[23:19:20] Jacob Desmone: .// idk what I gotta roll
[23:19:21] Paul-Henri Cartier: /me would pull the huge-ass radio from his back, fiddle with some controls before putting a hand to his headset
[23:19:25] Daniel J. Cutter: /looc for rebar ammo?
[23:19:27] Jacob Desmone: I make guns
[23:19:29] Paul-Henri Cartier: /radio Met some friends, not sure where you are.
[23:19:33] Jacob Desmone: .// yea
[23:19:38] Jacob Desmone: I don't know if I want to use one
[23:19:40] Paul-Henri Cartier: lambda. Not a fan.
[23:19:51] Jacob Desmone: /me Would keep molding slowly
[23:19:53] Ava Carter: your fault if you die without training
[23:19:56] Jacob Desmone: /rollskill Engineering
[23:19:58] Jacob Desmone: .// GAH DAMN
[23:19:59] Daniel J. Cutter: The "Commander" doesn't exactly...share eye to eye with them...Though, friends are friends...
[23:20:01] Jacob Desmone: .// EVEN WITH MY BONUS
[23:20:09] Jacob Desmone: .// actually it might be fabrication
[23:20:12] Jacob Desmone: .// now that I tihnk about it
[23:20:15] Jacob Desmone: .// or is it engineering
[23:20:21] Paul-Henri Cartier: /actlean
[23:20:26] Daniel J. Cutter: /looc Your legit needing rebar, YOu don't really need to craft it, you could probably just go to the CZ and find some
[23:20:34] Jacob Desmone: .// Rebar as in like what materials
[23:20:35] Daniel J. Cutter: /looc You CAN craft it
[23:20:48] Jacob Desmone: /y We got any rebar
[23:20:51] Daniel J. Cutter: /looc Just...Rebar, not really needing materials, just a pipe of rebar

[23:21:35] Jacob Desmone: You make fun of me
[23:21:36] Paul-Henri Cartier: look at me
[23:21:57] Paul-Henri Cartier: /me would reel his off-hand back, slapping the man.
[23:22:05] Daniel J. Cutter: /me Would rub his chin "Man...Wonder how the rest of the Exiles are doing...I doubt the Commander will leave us alone for too long without support"
[23:22:08] Jacob Desmone: /me Would look back at him
[23:22:11] Daniel J. Cutter: Hey...Hey
[23:22:14] Paul-Henri Cartier: Do. Not. Shout.
[23:22:17] Jacob Desmone: Gotcha
[23:22:21] Paul-Henri Cartier: You'll get us all killed
[23:22:25] Paul-Henri Cartier: and I prefer being alive
[23:22:26] Jacob Desmone: right right...
[23:22:30] Jacob Desmone: say uhh
[23:22:35] Jacob Desmone: I recongize the tiling on that ladder upstairs

[23:22:45] Paul-Henri Cartier: /me sighs
[23:22:50] Paul-Henri Cartier: Codes 2371
[23:22:54] Jacob Desmone: Gotcha
[23:22:56] Paul-Henri Cartier: we're under the Grotto
[23:22:57] Daniel J. Cutter: And Jacob...If you need rebar...you can just go to the CZ...I bet there would be a ton of it there...
[23:22:58] Paul-Henri Cartier: the washroom
[23:23:01] Jacob Desmone: Oh
[23:23:04] Jacob Desmone: I work there
[23:23:10] Jacob Desmone: My boss is cool with anti-citizens
[23:23:22] Daniel J. Cutter: Anti-Citizens?
[23:23:26] Daniel J. Cutter: Hmph...
[23:23:28] Paul-Henri Cartier: anyone got water?
[23:23:28] Qul'jal: /mey would sit down. Begining to meditate while doing so

[23:24:36] Paul-Henri Cartier: at least, in Foxtrot
[23:24:48] Daniel J. Cutter: Had to shut down a whole tunnel to make sure they don't go through it
[23:25:17] Daniel J. Cutter: Say...Paul
[23:25:35] Daniel J. Cutter: Would there be a problem for the Exiles to...stay around here, until we can truly find a place to hold out
[23:25:36] Jacob Desmone: Im back
[23:25:43] Jacob Desmone: I brought some of my tools and some rebar
[23:25:49] Paul-Henri Cartier: yeah, as long as you don't use that door unless you have to
[23:25:52] Daniel J. Cutter: Our last location was...sadly taken down by a OTA...
[23:25:54] Jacob Desmone: Gotcha
[23:25:56] Daniel J. Cutter: Of course...
[23:26:07] Paul-Henri Cartier: there's beds, fresh air

[23:26:37] Jacob Desmone: /rollskill Engineering
[23:26:38] Daniel J. Cutter: Ol' Jacob here is quite the known face above, I doubt he'll have problems finding some and bringing it down without problem
[23:26:41] Jacob Desmone: .// FUCKKKKKK
[23:26:44] Jacob Desmone: Finding what?
[23:26:51] Daniel J. Cutter: /looc ITS REBAR

[23:27:37] Ava Carter: yeah jacob
[23:27:39] Jacob Desmone: To get him to run down here
[23:27:55] Daniel J. Cutter: I don't exactly like the terms "Anti-Citizen" and "Non-Citizen"
[23:27:58] Jacob Desmone: His cans were destroyed in a raid he was gonna jump a CP so I made him commit a crime
[23:28:03] Jacob Desmone: So he would run down here
[23:28:04] Paul-Henri Cartier: /chardesc

[23:28:54] Paul-Henri Cartier: don't bother shooting to wound
[23:28:58] Ava Carter: look if we can get jefferson back on our team we're good to go and kill some cp's
[23:29:05] Paul-Henri Cartier: waste of ammunition, besides.. Infection will probably take them
[23:29:08] Daniel J. Cutter: When the crossbows are done...We could start a few ambushes....
[23:29:17] Daniel J. Cutter: They are quite quiet...
[23:29:18] Jacob Desmone: Anyway you said this was biolocked?
[23:29:24] Jacob Desmone: I got a radio jammer I gave you
[23:29:24] Daniel J. Cutter: The SMG is
