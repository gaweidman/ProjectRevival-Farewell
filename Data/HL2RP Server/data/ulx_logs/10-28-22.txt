[00:04:09] Daniel J. Cutter: The Exiles are not a reserved group...Unlike the northern territories...
[00:04:17] Jacob Desmone: I hear there is another group out there
[00:04:20] Jacob Desmone: The Preservationists
[00:04:23] Daniel J. Cutter: Ah...Them
[00:04:26] Jacob Desmone: Are they
[00:04:27] Jacob Desmone: Hostile?
[00:04:32] Daniel J. Cutter: Not from what i've seen
[00:04:42] Daniel J. Cutter: They're preserving old world...stuff
[00:04:45] Jacob Desmone: I guess..
[00:04:55] Jacob Desmone: People use me since I know a lot about stuff yknow
[00:04:59] Jacob Desmone: Same with the combine
[00:05:03] Jacob Desmone: I do everyones job

[00:05:07] Jacob Desmone: Commerce
[00:05:09] Jacob Desmone: Logistics

[00:05:20] Jacob Desmone: Hmpf
[00:05:25] Daniel J. Cutter: They care for old-world technology, and weapons
[00:05:31] Jacob Desmone: But not here.
[00:05:36] Daniel J. Cutter: Of course not...
[00:05:44] Daniel J. Cutter: We care for the preservation of humanity
[00:05:48] Jacob Desmone: One day I will figure out the highest I can go.
[00:06:09] Daniel J. Cutter: The northern territories were...Well split off from the Exiles after the battle of Jacob Station
[00:06:20] Jacob Desmone: I see.
[00:06:28] Daniel J. Cutter: Instead of catching up and aiding in the connection of the Exiles...They went north
[00:06:38] Daniel J. Cutter: Driven by...technology...and weaponry
[00:06:59] Jacob Desmone: Anything cool!
[00:07:04] Daniel J. Cutter: Anyway...
[00:07:15] Daniel J. Cutter: The northern territories are quite the armored fighting force...
[00:07:23] Daniel J. Cutter: Old World Military Grade gear...
[00:07:26] Daniel J. Cutter: High Tier weaponry
[00:07:37] Ava Carter: dont touch my stuff over there
[00:07:39] Daniel J. Cutter: They've done well, and they still do support the exiles...
[00:07:43] Ava Carter: or you will lose a finger
[00:07:52] Daniel J. Cutter: Though, they don't carry the same ideals...
[00:08:01] Jacob Desmone: Scuse me

[00:08:39] Daniel J. Cutter: /me Chuckles
[00:09:01] Daniel J. Cutter: I never told you about Jacob Station...Have I?
[00:09:05] Jacob Desmone: Nope
[00:09:14] Daniel J. Cutter: It was...a year...maybe less ago
[00:09:20] Jacob Desmone: /me While listening to his story he would contuine to work on the long range jammer
[00:09:23] Daniel J. Cutter: The Exiles were undergoing the "Great Expansion"
[00:09:32] Jacob Desmone: // 71 engineering
[00:09:33] Jacob Desmone: // based
[00:09:45] Daniel J. Cutter: Pushing through the outlands...getting as many people into the cities as possible, destabilizing
[00:09:52] Daniel J. Cutter: It was working quite well...
[00:10:10] Daniel J. Cutter: The Exiles held up at a old train hub..."Jacob Station"
[00:10:15] Daniel J. Cutter: It was the pride of the Exiles...
[00:10:24] Daniel J. Cutter: We used it for hits on Razor Trains...
[00:10:28] Jacob Desmone: Ah
[00:10:30] Daniel J. Cutter: it was secured...
[00:10:37] Daniel J. Cutter: Hell...Even had a old...old AA Gun
[00:10:52] Daniel J. Cutter: Had all we could need...
[00:11:03] Daniel J. Cutter: Even had a few artillery pieces...
[00:11:19] Daniel J. Cutter: And then...
[00:11:24] Daniel J. Cutter: The Combine found out about it
[00:11:30] Daniel J. Cutter: Launched a huge raid on it
[00:11:38] Jacob Desmone: /me While listening he would switch on the device it brimmed with energy
[00:11:41] Daniel J. Cutter: Jacob Station held out for...quite some time
[00:11:45] Daniel J. Cutter: A few months...,
[00:11:51] Jacob Desmone: So it was a siege huh.
[00:11:58] Jacob Desmone: I got it to work
[00:12:00] Jacob Desmone: Long range
[00:12:01] Jacob Desmone: Jammer
[00:12:13] Daniel J. Cutter: Then, the Combine broke through
[00:12:24] Daniel J. Cutter: We managed to get most of the people out on trains
[00:12:26] Ava Carter: baron
[00:12:29] Daniel J. Cutter: Hm?
[00:12:33] Daniel J. Cutter: My my...
[00:12:38] Daniel J. Cutter: You are one lucky person...
[00:12:42] Ava Carter: yep
[00:12:49] Jacob Desmone: /me Would switch the device off it would audibly power down
[00:13:17] Jacob Desmone: Love me old microwave jammers
[00:13:23] Ava Carter: im going to go for another scavenge run
[00:13:26] Jacob Desmone: See the reason is because microwaves
[00:13:28] Jacob Desmone: oh
[00:13:33] Daniel J. Cutter: Anyway
[00:13:35] Jacob Desmone: go on
[00:13:44] Daniel J. Cutter: Jacob Station was the one place keeping the Exiles in one group
[00:13:52] Daniel J. Cutter: After it fell, The Exiles were split in two
[00:13:57] Jacob Desmone: One here and..
[00:13:59] Daniel J. Cutter: You'd think that'd spell the end of us
[00:14:05] Daniel J. Cutter: But nope
[00:14:08] Daniel J. Cutter: We were everywhere
[00:14:14] Daniel J. Cutter: In every city nearby
[00:14:24] Jacob Desmone: So like fractured
[00:14:39] Daniel J. Cutter: We had two groups, The Western, and the Eastern...
[00:14:52] Daniel J. Cutter: Though...A small group, split off and used a train to go WAY up north
[00:15:02] Daniel J. Cutter: The Northern Alliance
[00:15:06] Jacob Desmone: I see.
[00:15:26] Daniel J. Cutter: They decided to focus on the presevation of old world weaponry and technology
[00:15:35] Daniel J. Cutter: Though, they still remained Exiles
[00:15:44] Daniel J. Cutter: They aided us any way they could
[00:16:05] Daniel J. Cutter: Anyway...The Exiles then managed to group back together into the now...What was it...
[00:16:43] Daniel J. Cutter: The "Great Central Exile Republic" or something around that...
[00:16:58] Jacob Desmone: Hmph
[00:17:01] Jacob Desmone: That sounds
[00:17:03] Jacob Desmone: Impressive
[00:17:04] Daniel J. Cutter: I know...
[00:17:05] Ava Carter: // got school tommorow but idc
[00:17:12] Jacob Desmone: // I don't
[00:17:14] Jacob Desmone: // not for a bit
[00:17:17] Daniel J. Cutter: It sounds very...old worldy
[00:17:24] Jacob Desmone: I know
[00:17:29] Jacob Desmone: Republic
[00:17:31] Daniel J. Cutter: Though, they're remaining strong
[00:17:37] Jacob Desmone: Sounds like that one old world country
[00:17:39] Daniel J. Cutter: Not as strong as the Lambda Resistance...
[00:17:49] Jacob Desmone: I remember reading about it in some books
[00:17:52] Jacob Desmone: Illegal books
[00:17:54] Jacob Desmone: UIhh
[00:17:58] Jacob Desmone: Union of soviet socialist republics
[00:17:58] Daniel J. Cutter: Psh...Illegal books...
[00:18:06] Jacob Desmone: Thats what it was called
[00:18:09] Jacob Desmone: I was a child when it existed
[00:18:13] Daniel J. Cutter: Interesting...
[00:18:14] Jacob Desmone: Russian people come from there.
[00:18:41] Daniel J. Cutter: The Exiles then began to send off expeditionary forces all around the region
[00:18:53] Ava Carter: welp that's the last scavenge run hopefully
[00:19:05] Jacob Desmone: Just hang here
[00:19:06] Daniel J. Cutter: Since the local group near C17 is the Lambda Resistance, they couldn't exactly just...walk on it
[00:19:09] Daniel J. Cutter: /looc in*
[00:19:11] Jacob Desmone: If you want I can go grab us some drinks from the kitchen
[00:19:16] Ava Carter: nah it's fine
[00:19:17] Jacob Desmone: I see...
[00:19:22] Daniel J. Cutter: So, they sent a expeditionary force into I17...
[00:19:26] Jacob Desmone: Ill even add some of our own spice I learnt some cooking..
[00:19:31] Daniel J. Cutter: 3 Of my men were caught on the train here...
[00:19:39] Jacob Desmone: I see.
[00:19:48] Daniel J. Cutter: They killed themselves before they were captured...
[00:19:55] Daniel J. Cutter: Poor souls...
[00:20:00] Jacob Desmone: Better way out
[00:20:13] Jacob Desmone: Who knows where they would of headed 
[00:20:16] Jacob Desmone: if they got caught
[00:20:27] Jacob Desmone: Ill be back let me go grab something from the kitchen upstairs
[00:20:30] Daniel J. Cutter: And now...Since I17 isn't in Exile Territory...We rely off of Exile Couriers to get supplies...
[00:20:49] Daniel J. Cutter: Though...Most of them were caught...or had to abandon their drops...
[00:21:04] Daniel J. Cutter: So now...They started to giving Dead Drops in the city
[00:21:18] Jacob Desmone: /me Would bring down a few cups
[00:21:22] Daniel J. Cutter: Though, I've had some...Difficulties getting them
[00:21:27] Jacob Desmone: /me Would add something in a packet too them sweetner
[00:21:34] Daniel J. Cutter: So...If you hear any rumours about a courier...or a drop
[00:21:34] Jacob Desmone: I got sweetner from the kitchen
[00:21:44] Jacob Desmone: and some coffee for the guards
[00:21:45] Jacob Desmone: Sorry go on
[00:21:57] Daniel J. Cutter: Don't take it as some rumor
[00:22:00] Daniel J. Cutter: Its most likely true...
[00:22:05] Ava Carter: i believe a courier died a couple weeks back
[00:22:09] Jacob Desmone: Yup
[00:22:09] Daniel J. Cutter: Damn..
[00:22:17] Jacob Desmone: Saw him as well
[00:22:19] Jacob Desmone: He lost his package
[00:22:23] Jacob Desmone: Picked a fight with me
[00:22:25] Ava Carter: he tried killing me
[00:22:25] Daniel J. Cutter: That must've been the gunpowder drop...
[00:22:31] Daniel J. Cutter: Hmph...
[00:22:33] Jacob Desmone: /me Would hold his coffee while listening
[00:22:38] Jacob Desmone: Anyone else want some coffee
[00:22:41] Jacob Desmone: I made it fresh from the kitchen

[00:24:08] Ava Carter: z
[00:24:13] Ava Carter: /looc void

[00:43:31] Daniel J. Cutter: Ask away
[00:43:32] Jacob Desmone: RF Recievers
[00:43:35] Jacob Desmone: or find radios
[00:43:38] Jacob Desmone: like those civilian ones
[00:43:43] Dropped "Big Dobar" from server<STEAM_0:0:25920272>
[00:43:46] Jacob Desmone: Cause I can make us some radios then
[00:43:47] Daniel J. Cutter: Hm....
[00:43:55] Jacob Desmone: .// I remember asking to make a transreciever before but u said no bean
[00:43:57] Jacob Desmone: .// and now I can
[00:43:58] Daniel J. Cutter: Well..I can't go up myself...
[00:44:05] Jacob Desmone: Theres a radio in the CZ 
[00:44:10] Daniel J. Cutter: Hmm
[00:44:10] Jacob Desmone: I know that
[00:44:18] Daniel J. Cutter: Well...We can strip that then
[00:44:20] Jacob Desmone: Think of anything that can recieve a transmission
[00:44:24] Daniel J. Cutter: Actually...silly me
[00:44:25] Ava Carter: what about those request devices?
[00:44:27] Jacob Desmone: Well I need quite the amount of recievers
[00:44:34] Jacob Desmone: Request devices give a single channel rf transmitter
[00:44:37] Jacob Desmone: Which sucks
[00:44:41] Daniel J. Cutter: /me Would reach into a small bag taking out a armband, he would toss it to Jacob
[00:44:42] Jacob Desmone: Cause then I gotta upgrade them
[00:44:43] Daniel J. Cutter: Here...
[00:44:45] Jacob Desmone: /me Would catch it
[00:44:51] Daniel J. Cutter: Exile Armband...
[00:44:55] Jacob Desmone: /me Would apply it onto his arm for now
[00:44:58] Daniel J. Cutter: Wear it while you're down here
[00:44:58] Jacob Desmone: /me over his combine armband
[00:45:21] Daniel J. Cutter: Here I hope whenever a courier comes...We can actually get him this time
[00:45:31] Ava Carter: ok so our next goal is to get radios correct?
[00:45:31] Jacob Desmone: He might have eletronics for us
[00:45:34] Jacob Desmone: Ye
[00:45:38] Daniel J. Cutter: I have a radio on me...
[00:45:39] Jacob Desmone: I can make us a ton of we juist get recievers
[00:45:44] Ava Carter: lucky ass
[00:45:53] Daniel J. Cutter: The Serviceman most likely has some
[00:45:57] Jacob Desmone: Think of anything with a reciever
[00:46:00] Ava Carter: maybe i can jump a union and steal his radio
[00:46:04] Jacob Desmone: Haha
[00:46:09] Daniel J. Cutter: Or purchase from the Serviceman
[00:46:18] Daniel J. Cutter: Though, It is quite possible for us to jump a CP now..
[00:46:18] Jacob Desmone: True but is he here?
[00:46:27] Daniel J. Cutter: No...Not around...
[00:46:41] Jacob Desmone: Radios have recievers
[00:46:47] Daniel J. Cutter: Though...I have a plan
[00:46:53] Ava Carter: oo plan time?
[00:46:55] Daniel J. Cutter: We ambush a CP in the alleyway
[00:47:02] Jacob Desmone: Before we get to murder I have one more idea.
[00:47:05] Daniel J. Cutter: One hides in those small residential rooms 
[00:47:16] Daniel J. Cutter: While the other hides in the dumpster
[00:47:17] Daniel J. Cutter: We jump out
[00:47:21] Daniel J. Cutter: Mug...Or kill
[00:47:25] Ava Carter: we kill
[00:47:29] Daniel J. Cutter: /me Chuckles
[00:47:29] Ava Carter: we cant risk it
[00:47:33] Daniel J. Cutter: Indeed
[00:47:40] Jacob Desmone: Combine consoles have a ton of recievers they have to have to be able to supply the amount of orders
[00:47:44] Jacob Desmone: There is one I worked with a grid on
[00:47:46] Jacob Desmone: Near the CZ
[00:47:53] Jacob Desmone: I just need guards and I can unlock the paneling
[00:47:55] Jacob Desmone: With  the hex key
[00:47:55] Ava Carter: question
[00:48:00] Daniel J. Cutter: Good luck with that...Those things are connected to a alarm...
[00:48:01] Jacob Desmone: And disable the alarm with the jammer
[00:48:03] Ava Carter: how will we lead the guard to the allyway?
[00:48:06] Daniel J. Cutter: Mmm...
[00:48:12] Daniel J. Cutter: If that cuts off though...
[00:48:14] Jacob Desmone: Biosignals and radio signals
[00:48:17] Jacob Desmone: And alarm signals
[00:48:18] Jacob Desmone: are all the same
[00:48:19] Daniel J. Cutter: We'll have the city swarming with CPs
[00:48:23] Ava Carter: maybe jacob can lead them?
[00:48:29] Daniel J. Cutter: We could
[00:48:33] Daniel J. Cutter: Though that could risk Jacob
[00:48:38] Jacob Desmone: They said that it sent them static for 3 days and they ignored it
[00:48:39] Daniel J. Cutter: Which I'd rather not have happen
[00:48:39] Ava Carter: true
[00:48:46] Jacob Desmone: So im not completley sure about that
[00:48:51] Jacob Desmone: They have gone days weeks without that console
[00:48:58] Daniel J. Cutter: CPs would most likely go down there sometime
[00:48:59] Jacob Desmone: 20 minutes without response
[00:48:59] Daniel J. Cutter: Or...
[00:49:01] Ava Carter: i'll take that if you dont mind
[00:49:04] Daniel J. Cutter: We get a misfit civ
[00:49:09] Daniel J. Cutter: Cause a bit of trouble
[00:49:13] Jacob Desmone: Zoey still around?
[00:49:13] Daniel J. Cutter: Run...Jump
[00:49:15] Daniel J. Cutter: Ya know
[00:49:20] Ava Carter: zoey?
[00:49:23] Ava Carter: who's zoey
[00:49:29] Jacob Desmone: Person you were with?
[00:49:31] Jacob Desmone: Before
[00:49:32] Jacob Desmone: Uhh
[00:49:34] Jacob Desmone: Woman
[00:49:36] Jacob Desmone: UHhh
[00:49:38] Jacob Desmone: New person
[00:49:45] Jacob Desmone: You introduced to the city
[00:49:50] Ava Carter: OH THAT ONE?
[00:49:53] Jacob Desmone: Yea what happened to her?
[00:49:56] Ava Carter: the one that helped me jump a cop?
[00:49:59] Jacob Desmone: Yea
[00:50:01] Ava Carter: yeah i have no idea
[00:50:04] Jacob Desmone: Shit
[00:50:07] Jacob Desmone: Welp
[00:50:15] Jacob Desmone: I really don't like the prospect of murder that should be the last option
[00:50:15] Ava Carter: one day they were here and then they wren't
[00:50:25] Daniel J. Cutter: Murder...Psh
[00:50:32] Daniel J. Cutter: They have murdered plenty of innocent people
[00:50:33] Ava Carter: jacob again we cant *risk it*
[00:50:47] Daniel J. Cutter: What CPs have done...They deserve death...
[00:50:47] Jacob Desmone: We cant your right
[00:50:54] Jacob Desmone: /me Sighs
[00:51:02] Daniel J. Cutter: They chose their side...
[00:51:07] Jacob Desmone: Welp if you figure out any other way to get recievers tell me
[00:51:11] Ava Carter: jacob just for now accept we have to kill to survive
[00:51:18] Jacob Desmone: I guess.
[00:51:36] Jacob Desmone: Automatic lights have recievers
[00:51:44] Jacob Desmone: theres that
[00:51:47] Jacob Desmone: Elevators have recievers
[00:51:50] Jacob Desmone: like the buttons
[00:51:56] Ava Carter: oh
[00:51:56] Daniel J. Cutter: Hmm...
[00:52:04] Ava Carter: i have an idea where i could get the elevator buttons
[00:52:05] Daniel J. Cutter: I guess we just use the radios...
[00:52:05] Ava Carter: but
[00:52:15] Jacob Desmone: I mean if we disassemble a radio to make a radio
[00:52:15] Daniel J. Cutter: Elevators are too risky
[00:52:19] Jacob Desmone: I guess
[00:52:22] Jacob Desmone: UHh what else..
[00:52:22] Dropped "The E" from server<STEAM_0:0:40961801>
[00:52:33] Jacob Desmone: Combine locks have recievers
[00:52:35] Jacob Desmone: Probably.
[00:52:39] Jacob Desmone: CWU locks probably do
[00:52:51] Jacob Desmone: Recieve and transmit information to databases
[00:52:55] Client "The E" connected.
[00:52:57] Jacob Desmone: when a ID is slid.
[00:53:03] Daniel J. Cutter: Hm...
[00:53:13] Jacob Desmone: I mean we got the jammer
[00:53:16] Jacob Desmone: So its easy to kill a CP
[00:53:20] Daniel J. Cutter: Indeed...
[00:53:27] Jacob Desmone: But I mean if we want radios for everyone
[00:53:28] Jacob Desmone: Think about it
[00:53:29] Ava Carter: /looc even with the jammer in my inv it still works?
[00:53:31] Daniel J. Cutter: Perhaps when we ambush them in the alleyway...
[00:53:34] Jacob Desmone: .// has to be on ground
[00:53:40] Daniel J. Cutter: You put the Jammer up while they're there...
[00:53:46] Ava Carter: alright
[00:53:48] Daniel J. Cutter: Then we kill em...You turn the jammer off...
[00:53:58] Daniel J. Cutter: Then boom...Home free
[00:54:14] Jacob Desmone: I am a trusted engineer
[00:54:17] Jacob Desmone: So I guess it would work
[00:54:20] Daniel J. Cutter: *Trusted*
[00:54:21] Ava Carter: so plan is TL:DR - Get a misfit citizen to help us lead the combine to the alleyway, during that i place down the jammer
[00:54:22] Daniel J. Cutter: Thats the point

[00:54:41] Jacob Desmone: So if we ever are going for something major
[00:54:46] Jacob Desmone: Tell me and ill get that shit offline no time
[00:54:53] Jacob Desmone: Funny thing is GRID is a idiot
[00:55:01] Jacob Desmone: They don't have a coolant for their camera
[00:55:06] Jacob Desmone: I bet ill be up there in a week fixing it again
[00:55:10] Jacob Desmone: Cause he doesn't think im smart enough
[00:55:12] Daniel J. Cutter: Interesting...
[00:55:18] Jacob Desmone: So all I gotta do is send multiple request orders
[00:55:22] Jacob Desmone: And boom overheation AGAIN
[00:55:23] Daniel J. Cutter: /me Would put his bag
[00:55:24] Daniel J. Cutter: Hmph
