[16:29:56] Jonathan Jackson: Storage? What type of storage?
[16:30:02] Frankie Miller: Some kind of scientific facility.
[16:30:05] Sona la Rona: body storage or whatever
[16:30:10] Élisabeth Morel: Can we go and recover them?
[16:30:14] Frankie Miller: Looks like... they don't know what to do with you. They're going to do some research on you.
[16:30:28] Frankie Miller: It's possible. I think I know what we'll do.
[16:30:31] Frankie Miller: Let me just...
[16:30:33] Jonathan Jackson: I've seen what the combine do, I'd rather not be "researched".

[16:31:12] Jonathan Jackson killed Marko Shades using player
[16:31:16] Frankie Miller: Whatever they told you about a video game was a lie.
[16:31:18] Jonathan Jackson: One deactivated.
[16:31:20] Tony Ricci: ow
[16:31:21] Frankie Miller: You were in a simulation.
[16:31:28] Jonathan Jackson: That is correct.
[16:31:29] Élisabeth Morel: Christ
[16:31:31] Frankie Miller: They somehow put you into a computer uflly.
[16:31:33] Frankie Miller: No video game at all.
[16:31:36] Sona la Rona: huh
[16:31:40] Frankie Miller: They did this thing that they do all the time. It's called lying.
[16:31:42] Élisabeth Morel: But why...
[16:31:47] Jonathan Jackson killed Heinz Baldman VII using player
[16:31:48] Frankie Miller: Testing... something?

[16:32:39] Jonathan Jackson: Christ.
[16:32:39] Frankie Miller: Alright.
[16:32:41] Élisabeth Morel: They're gonna kill us after this.
[16:32:42] Frankie Miller: Let's get back to it.
[16:32:45] Jonathan Jackson: And I thought it was just a simulation.
[16:32:49] Frankie Miller: They're going to hook you all back up to a computer to do research.
[16:33:03] Frankie Miller: It was a simulation, but you weren't in a video game.
[16:33:11] Sona la Rona: wait are the combine trying to kill us?
[16:33:12] Frankie Miller: You didn't notice you couldn't take off the headset?
[16:33:17] Frankie Miller: no, not at all
[16:33:20] Frankie Miller: They were trying to test on you.
[16:33:24] Élisabeth Morel: They did strap them on tightly.
[16:33:34] Frankie Miller: They were going to put you in, experiment on you, see how steable people were in a compute,r and then take you out
[16:33:40] Frankie Miller: .//stable&
[16:34:04] Frankie Miller: But something went wrong and you wou nd up in tghese bodies. Either you guys broke it or it bugged out on its own
[16:34:04] Jacob Desmone: // gotta awalk my dog
[16:34:08] Frankie Miller: Alright.
[16:34:12] Frankie Miller: So, getting back in your b odies.
[16:34:18] Carson Copper: // tell your dog I said hi
[16:34:48] Frankie Miller: Seems like you're going to get hooked back up to a computer. When this happens, I'll need to send over some data to jolt your bodies back, with you people in it./
[16:35:01] Élisabeth Morel: Hang on
[16:35:07] Élisabeth Morel: Are they gonna kill us after?
[16:35:08] Jonathan Jackson: And does this have a chance to go wrong?
[16:35:21] Tony Ricci: What choice do we have?
[16:35:25] Frankie Miller: I don't think so, as long as you keep quiet about what happened.
[16:35:36] Frankie Miller: Just tell them that the game started acting weird and then you woke up in their lab
[16:35:48] Frankie Miller: I don't think they'll question it too much.
[16:35:49] Élisabeth Morel: We are so fucked..
[16:35:51] Frankie Miller: I hope, for your sake..
[16:35:58] Frankie Miller: Look, we'll get there.
[16:36:01] Frankie Miller: Beats being trapped here forever.
[16:36:12] Frankie Miller: Anyways, to be able to get that data out, I need a few things from you.
[16:36:22] Tony Ricci: .// do i take AA or AAA
[16:36:24] Frankie Miller: First off, one of the systems over here is damaged, I need one of you to repair it.
[16:36:34] Sona la Rona: not me
[16:36:35] Élisabeth Morel: Any engineers in the crowd?
[16:36:35] Jonathan Jackson: We've got an engineer.
[16:36:40] Frankie Miller: Then, the other thing. I need higher level access.
[16:36:48] Jonathan Jackson: Where's Jacob?
[16:36:48] Frankie Miller: We'll need to take an elite overwatch unit.
[16:36:51] Frankie Miller: /me looks over to the loyalist.
[16:36:53] Frankie Miller: ALIVE.
[16:37:01] Frankie Miller: It's not a crime if we don't hurt them
[16:37:06] Frankie Miller: Or at least, it's not wrong.
[16:37:18] Élisabeth Morel: Since when did the resistance care about that kinda thing anyways..
[16:37:19] Tony Ricci: // brb

[16:37:38] Élisabeth Morel: Interesting
[16:37:41] Jonathan Jackson: /y Jacob?
[16:37:44] Frankie Miller: As far as I care, every elite could die miserably and I'd sleep better.
[16:37:44] Sona la Rona: i dont care as long as we get out of here
[16:37:50] Élisabeth Morel: Hm
[16:37:59] Élisabeth Morel: So we should get moving.
[16:38:01] Frankie Miller: Plus, we need the sample of genetic material from a living host.
[16:38:15] Frankie Miller: I'll send out a signal to get a patrol team over here. You people find the underground lab and fix the computers.
[16:38:20] Frankie Miller: Let's move!
[16:38:27] Frankie Miller: /pm jackson alright, make a new OTA

[21:22:27] Douglas Hudson: /w probably shot em' out in the open eh?... not much of a useful kill if ya' can't loot the body.

Afterwards he'd quickly get to work, pouring medical grade alcohol along a rag and dabbing it over the wound, before slapping a tad bit of biogel along it in order to allow for regeneration. Afterwards he'd wrap it in a nice little bit of Gauze Bandage. - "Right...."

[21:32:05] Jack Kingston: I only assume. I didn't catch ranks but I've seen recruits beaten with civilians as well.
[21:32:12] CCA.C17-UNION.i2.97018: Yeah.. I heard. Some shithole it turned out to be.
[21:32:20] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: Yeah uh.... it was bad, bad city.
[21:32:24] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /v You are overcome with great pain and emotion. You feel a crack, and you feel the lifelines of many humans into another borderworld, not Xen, but elsewhere.
[21:32:25] Qul'jal: /me would gaze closer at the crystal. Looking deeply into the crack of the crystal
[21:32:32] Jack Kingston: I don't think he was a recruit, mind you. Just making correlations.

[21:32:38] CCA.C17-UNION.i2.97018: Uh- yeah.

[21:33:54] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.06912: /v The crystal is out of place, not just because it's on Earth, but even in this existence it feels.. off in some way.
[21:33:54] Jack Kingston: I'm sure their doing other work, they seem busy.
[21:33:56] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: Oh

[21:35:17] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: I've got someone to tend to, see you around?
[21:35:24] Lin'Garung: /vort dangerous indeed... perhaps we would be able to find more to fill in the gaps...
[21:35:34] Lin'Garung: /vort only then could we correctly act
[21:35:34] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: /me gave a thumbs up, nodding slowly. - "Yeah, I did a decent job, but he'll need more than just some rushed field med."
[21:35:37] CCA.C17-HELIX.i3.08874: /me scratches the back of his head, it does nothing, but the message is sent.

[22:39:41] Ethan King: Basic mission we've got today fellas. Our target is the Warehouse 3 terminal connected to the PA system. We infiltrate as stealthily as we can through the catwalks and bust our way inside the control room. GRID is our VIP, he'll be hacking the PA as we have users with Crossbows sitting on the catwalks providing overwatch, those with MP7s and Shotties will close guard GRID and the Warehouse 3 internals.
[22:39:58] Qul'jal: /me sit down. Attempting to open his eyes to more possibilites.....
[22:39:59] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: //it emits a bunch of noise but you need a frequency to broadcats the nosie on
[22:40:02] Ethan King: We make a speech, set up IEDs on the Warehouse and exfil, blow it up and send a message that every civvie here will remember.
[22:40:04] Paul-Henri Cartier: haven't been called that in a while

[22:41:52] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.10945: //oh yeah, that part of it is really hard to manage
