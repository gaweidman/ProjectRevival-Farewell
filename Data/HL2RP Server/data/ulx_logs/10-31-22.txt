[17:06:02] Jacob Desmone: You want a quiver?
[17:06:07] Ava Carter: quiver?
[17:06:17] Jacob Desmone: Its a holding device that allows crossbowmen to fire faster
[17:06:18] Qul'jal: /ooc Q. You should heal me lol. Got beat in the head by a crowbar by accident
[17:06:22] Jacob Desmone: Like medieval times.

[17:09:29] Ava Carter: /looc shut up
[17:09:32] Qul'jal: /pm harris Well nevermind. I suppose if we have that crystal we already have a place of power since the crystal itself is an item of great importance
[17:09:33] Ava Carter: /chardesc

[18:42:31] CCA.C17-UNION.OfC.56321: /me tied the UNION, roughly grasping over the mans pockets and obviously points of hiding equipment. The demonstration would be rather violent, showing little care for the units personal space. - "Keep yourself on top of the suspect, your boot on their heel allows for less movement if they try to make a run for it, along with this keep a hand on one shoulder. Tying isn't needed ,but recommended."

[18:46:58] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.83253: Unrest Structure is wh...*Ahem*   When a CCA Operation is unable to continue and requires reformation and the causes remains active
[18:47:12] Ava Carter: // 4 cp's, 1 conscript, and 3 citizens nice
[18:47:14] CCA.i17-GRID.DvL.24710: right, do you have any actual experience in any field of mechanics or engineering?

[19:16:46] Jacob Desmone: Hi
[19:16:47] Otto Von Habsburg: You. Jacob right?
[19:16:50] Jacob Desmone: Yea
[19:17:02] Otto Von Habsburg: I figured you worked here, with the commerce shirt.
[19:17:10] Jacob Desmone: Only shop in town
[19:17:11] Jacob Desmone: So yea.
[19:17:18] Otto Von Habsburg: Now, come, away from that cam right there.
[19:17:35] Otto Von Habsburg: /me takes off the repirator.
[19:17:41] Jacob Desmone: /me Does the same
[19:18:12] Otto Von Habsburg: Now, I've considered your proposal. And the thing is, I'm not sure you your "leader" is but clearly they are incompetent.
[19:19:04] Otto Von Habsburg: The fact that they let something happen like *that* yesterday. It's you need me around so you all don't immediatley get killed.
[19:19:13] Jacob Desmone: I have no idea what happened yesterday
[19:19:21] Jacob Desmone: Personally I don't approve of it.
[19:19:43] Otto Von Habsburg: Personally, it seems if this keeps happening there is no more Jacob or exiles.
[19:19:54] Jacob Desmone: Thats why I think she got told not to do it
[19:20:02] Jacob Desmone: I am leaving the exiles if this shit happens again for no reason.
[19:20:05] Jacob Desmone: We didn't even get the gun.
[19:20:13] Jacob Desmone: Or anything it was for nothing
[19:20:23] Otto Von Habsburg: Mhm. It was unorganized and attracted to much attention for no benefit.
[19:20:44] Jacob Desmone: We have a organized raid soon for benefit.
[19:20:50] Jacob Desmone: I know of that but what ava did
[19:20:54] Jacob Desmone: Was unnacceptable
[19:21:03] Otto Von Habsburg: I'll be willing to help your group out with planning, but I won't go farther than that. There's no point in putting all of your money into a losing deck.
[19:21:12] Jacob Desmone: Sounds good
[19:21:19] Jacob Desmone: I do planning aswell
[19:21:23] Jacob Desmone: and a few menial tasks
[19:21:44] Otto Von Habsburg: Who *is* your leader by the way?
[19:21:50] Jacob Desmone: Daniel Cutter
[19:21:56] Jacob Desmone: Or he likes to be called
[19:21:57] Jacob Desmone: the Baron
[19:22:00] Otto Von Habsburg: That fool? God.
[19:22:09] Otto Von Habsburg: Is he just pretending he isn't a criminal now?
[19:22:15] Jacob Desmone: Who knows
[19:22:17] Jacob Desmone: Follow me
[19:22:24] Otto Von Habsburg: Hmph.
[19:22:34] Jacob Desmone: /me Would slide the door open
[19:22:46] Jacob Desmone: Our base of operations
[19:22:46] Jacob Desmone: For now
[19:22:57] Otto Von Habsburg: Hm. I see.
[19:23:15] Jacob Desmone: Im their uhh
[19:23:17] Otto Von Habsburg: I heard about another area like this. Tryed mapping it out but never found it.
[19:23:21] Jacob Desmone: Planner and engineer.
[19:23:23] Otto Von Habsburg: /looc tried8
[19:23:33] Jacob Desmone: I make guns explosives
[19:23:33] Jacob Desmone: Radios
[19:23:35] Otto Von Habsburg: Clearly you aren't a planner if you don't have control.
[19:23:35] Jacob Desmone: Armor
[19:23:37] Jacob Desmone: Hah
[19:23:41] Jacob Desmone: Well more engineer
[19:23:44] Otto Von Habsburg: I'm serious.
[19:23:50] Jacob Desmone: Hmph
[19:23:59] Jacob Desmone: I would love organization
[19:24:01] Jacob Desmone: They don't listen to me
[19:24:08] Otto Von Habsburg: This group may have a common union, but there isn't anything sticking it together.
[19:24:14] Jacob Desmone: Your right.
[19:24:18] Otto Von Habsburg: /me looks over the table.
[19:24:31] Otto Von Habsburg: I've heard of your handiwork. In the sewers right?
[19:24:34] Jacob Desmone: Mhm
[19:24:43] Otto Von Habsburg: The Grunt that got ambushed by your group.
[19:24:45] Jacob Desmone: /me Would pick up a armor plating and put it back down
[19:24:49] Jacob Desmone: Yup I unbiolocked his gun
[19:24:56] Jacob Desmone: /me Would pick up a GRUNT SMG
[19:25:09] Jacob Desmone: This was from it
[19:25:24] Jacob Desmone: I cleaned and unlocked the baby
[19:25:28] Otto Von Habsburg: I can tell. Guns are great and all sure.
[19:25:34] Otto Von Habsburg: I'm sure you are very talented.
[19:25:41] Jacob Desmone: I would say so.
[19:26:09] Otto Von Habsburg: But this group is going nowhere until a common objective is made. Have you learned of the schedule for the trains that come in the city yet?
[19:26:18] Jacob Desmone: I know a few
[19:26:21] Jacob Desmone: But not all
[19:26:27] Otto Von Habsburg: Well here's what I'll tell you.
[19:27:20] Otto Von Habsburg: Those trains, most of them are nothing. A whole lot of nothing. Basic rations, restraints, nothing of intrest. If you go willy nilly on a raid in the train station you might just find a cart of OTA, worse yet, stalkers.
[19:28:00] Otto Von Habsburg: The ones with weaponry and ammunition are much, much more spread out. They aren't on a schedule, you need inside information to get a good basis on when they'll arive.
[19:28:08] Jacob Desmone: I see.
[19:28:58] Otto Von Habsburg: I understand already from what I have heard from another person that a group was planning a raid on one of those resupply trains, doing that will net nothing needed.
[19:29:38] Otto Von Habsburg: What you people need to do is to find a contact within the combine and figure out when this might happen, whether it be threatening a CP or getting someone willingly on your side.
[19:29:53] Jacob Desmone: Ill relay this
[19:29:57] Jacob Desmone: Like I said if you want to be our planner
[19:30:00] Jacob Desmone: I can bring you in
[19:30:02] Jacob Desmone: as a friend
[19:30:26] Otto Von Habsburg: I'll help. I don't want to be officially involved but if I hear anything or hear news, I'll be down here.
[19:30:32] Jacob Desmone: Alright then
[19:30:35] Jacob Desmone: If you ever want anything made
[19:30:35] Jacob Desmone: ask me
[19:30:40] Jacob Desmone: Also here if you wannt communicate
[19:30:40] Otto Von Habsburg: Again, even with your small victory, the combine have a stacked hand.
[19:30:47] Otto Von Habsburg: Of course.
[19:30:59] Jacob Desmone: Freq is uhh
[19:31:00] Jacob Desmone: Let me check
