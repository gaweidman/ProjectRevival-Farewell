[22:14:25] Matthew Rattias: /me sits on the cold metal bench, contemplating his life. Inside his cell, he has a flashlight, a filter, a CID, a frying pan, and a cooking pot, but alas, his hands are tied. Wiith this in mind, he slowly begins to formulate a master plan; He will cook a mythical meal, one never before seen on this Earth. He springs his plan into motion, slowly pulling the cooking pot out of his back pocket, placing it over an invisible flame. His schizophrenia is surely acting up, but that will not stop the mighty Rattias The Fifth, Senior! A good chunk of meat slips into the pot from the heavens, beginning to cook a phantom meal of the Gods. A fresh pot of soup, consisting of a multitude of vegetables & fresh chicken, giving off a wonderful aroma to the-
[22:14:26] Matthew Rattias: /me -prison cell. The soups delicious aroma is almost sickening, at how good it is! But alas, Rattias cannot consume his godly creation, and thus places the schizophrenia-produced soup back into the inner void. His demons won, but Rattias is too strong and was able to overcome them. Now, he waits for his savior, the one who placed him in this cell in the first place!
