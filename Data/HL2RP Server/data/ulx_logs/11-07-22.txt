[00:00:11] Adir'En: /it The vortigaunt turns around "The name this one knows for oneself is three four zero seven one. The Paul suggested Adir'En. A name originally "Adrien""
[00:00:41] Jack O'Sullivan: You don't have names were you come from?
[00:00:52] Jack O'Sullivan: or has the Union scrupped your brain?
[00:01:19] Adir'En: This one has long forgotten the first name. It was spoken at some point, but this one was reminded to forget it.
[00:01:44] Jack O'Sullivan: A long time ago.. How many times have you been reborn?
[00:01:52] Jack O'Sullivan: Do you even know? 
[00:02:21] Adir'En: That is an interesting question. This one does not know, does not remember.
[00:02:45] Jack O'Sullivan: But do you know how long you have been in this *form*?
[00:03:00] Jack O'Sullivan: Maybe a rough guess?
[00:03:13] Adir'En: Under The Combine?
[00:03:26] Jack O'Sullivan: No even before
[00:03:51] Adir'En: Ahhh.... This one understand now. Sadly, it is forgotten.
[00:04:17] Jack O'Sullivan: They really did a number on you huh? Worse than drinking the water they give us
[00:04:21] Adir'En: It was shameful to have forgotten this ones own name, but The Combine do much to my kin.
[00:04:35] Jack O'Sullivan: I can imagine
[00:04:56] Adir'En: We are indebted to them, for our past aggressions.
[00:05:09] Adir'En: One thing I *do* remember.
[00:05:17] Jack O'Sullivan: You fought the combine?
[00:06:08] Adir'En: Our kind, yes. For this one's knowledge, it is unsure. But we were shackled for a reason.
[00:06:55] Jack O'Sullivan: So let me get this straight. You fought the combine, then came to earth and fought us and then the combine came and won over us both?
[00:07:44] Adir'En: It is a complicated situation. Something an elder could explain better than this one.
[00:07:53] Jack O'Sullivan: Mh
[00:07:57] Adir'En: One with much wisdom.
[00:08:29] Jack O'Sullivan: I would love to hear their wisdom behind coming her and slaugthering my fellow man... No offense
[00:08:59] Adir'En: We were slaves to another, forced to do so.
[00:09:08] Jack O'Sullivan: Oh..
[00:09:14] Adir'En: Much like The Combine.
[00:09:22] Jack O'Sullivan: Damn..
[00:09:26] Adir'En: Our kind knows much of slavery.
[00:09:35] Jack O'Sullivan: Sure sounds like it
[00:10:01] Jack O'Sullivan: Sounds much like a folk we have here on earth
[00:10:15] Jack O'Sullivan: Dunno if they are still around though...
[00:10:21] Adir'En: Wisdom follow many beings.
[00:10:27] Adir'En: The Combine dislike this.
[00:10:39] Jack O'Sullivan: If so then I fear they are gone
[00:10:54] Adir'En: Perhaps some are left.
[00:11:03] Jack O'Sullivan: But they have been enslaved and hunted for a long time too
[00:11:11] Jack O'Sullivan: But by my people
[00:11:12] Adir'En: If not, wisdom is still obtained. it is not lost, much like many things.
[00:11:38] Jack O'Sullivan: I'm sure their holy city is still standing
[00:12:01] Jack O'Sullivan: was after all the birth place of many religions on earth
[00:12:07] Adir'En: There are many out there, beyond seventeen.
[00:12:12] Adir'En: Still.
[00:12:21] Jack O'Sullivan: I hope so..
[00:12:46] Jack O'Sullivan: No idea what has happened to the rest of the world
[00:12:52] Jack O'Sullivan: but knowing the combine
[00:12:56] Jack O'Sullivan: I doubt anything good
[00:13:06] Adir'En: Hmmm. Indeed not.
[00:13:37] Adir'En: Rest sounds good, this one still feels the shackle markings.
[00:13:45] Jack O'Sullivan: Ah yes
[00:14:01] Jack O'Sullivan: Get some rest so you can reconnect to the vortsomething
[00:14:34] Adir'En: Wisdom already from you.
[00:14:48] Jack O'Sullivan: Eh, I only know much about drinking
