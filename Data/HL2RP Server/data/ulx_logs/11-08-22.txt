[12:13:14] Lin'Garung: This one is unware of their leadership
[12:13:22] Jack O'Sullivan: King? who davied?
[12:13:34] Jack O'Sullivan: Or the baron as he likes to be called
[12:13:53] Lin'Garung: Hmm perhaps...
[12:14:56] Lin'Garung: This one only knows the ethan king...
[12:15:03] Jack O'Sullivan: Hm
[12:15:10] Jack O'Sullivan: I sadly don't recall him
[12:15:26] Jack O'Sullivan: But he's probably as bad as the rest of em
[12:15:58] Lin'Garung: Hmm he is offten with the Paul Cartier... The one who is offten seen in a combine uniform of sorts
[12:16:08] Jack O'Sullivan: Ah
[12:16:22] Jack O'Sullivan: I don't know pal
[12:16:29] Jack O'Sullivan: But all in all
[12:16:32] Jack O'Sullivan: They are bad people
[12:16:42] Jack O'Sullivan: They don't care about us, Lin
[12:16:51] Jack O'Sullivan: They only care about their end goal
[12:17:04] Lin'Garung: /vort Ava...
[12:17:33] Lin'Garung: This one recalled the Ava'Carter claiming to kill... for 'Fun'...
[12:17:50] Jack O'Sullivan: A very good example..
[12:17:53] Lin'Garung: The others may also take this opinion aswell...
[12:18:03] Jack O'Sullivan: It wouldn't surprise me pal
[12:18:10] Lin'Garung: Does the Sullivan know of this 'end goal'?
[12:18:38] Jack O'Sullivan: Their end goal might be to get the combine off earth, but they will do that no matter the cost
[12:18:48] Jack O'Sullivan: Even if it means killing innocents on the way
[12:19:02] Jack O'Sullivan: That is what I've gather so far from their actions
[12:19:23] Jack O'Sullivan: Ava didn't care about putting os all in danger if it meant she got to kill something
[12:19:29] Lin'Garung: They dont seem to be the type to calculate their odds...
[12:19:47] Jack O'Sullivan: The baron didn't care about putting me and serviceman in danger if it meant he got to kill
[12:20:09] Jack O'Sullivan: And they didn't care about putting all the people in the town in danger if it meant they got to kill as well
[12:20:21] Lin'Garung: This one is unsure of the name baron... 
[12:20:35] Lin'Garung: Perhaps the Sullivan would have a description
[12:20:41] Jack O'Sullivan: He's real name is Davied 
[12:20:59] Jack O'Sullivan: I sadly do not other than he wears one of those army suits with the gas mask
[12:21:10] Lin'Garung: Ah... Understood
[12:21:34] Jack O'Sullivan: But at the end of the day
[12:21:44] Jack O'Sullivan: We should not have anything to do with them
[12:21:49] Jack O'Sullivan: They only bring trouble
[12:22:05] Lin'Garung: Indeed...
[12:22:12] Jack O'Sullivan: The Baron took me and two others hostage to be able to kill a cp
[12:22:17] Jack O'Sullivan: And after he was done
[12:22:28] Jack O'Sullivan: He acted all kind and said he was here to help us
[12:22:30] Jack O'Sullivan: Save us
[12:22:54] Jack O'Sullivan: After he had just told us he would kill us if we did anything and blew up a lady
[12:23:07] Lin'Garung: Hmm... It was unwise of them to not share the plan
[12:23:18] Jack O'Sullivan: They never tell us anything
[12:23:28] Lin'Garung: If only had this one acted...
[12:23:45] Jack O'Sullivan: Acted? 
[12:23:49] Jack O'Sullivan: Fought them?
[12:24:43] Lin'Garung: It would have done this one well... if Lin would have voiced its opinion sooner...
[12:24:57] Jack O'Sullivan: It's alright, Lin
[12:25:11] Jack O'Sullivan: They would of probably ignored you.. or kicked you out
[12:25:27] Jack O'Sullivan: They have the whole mentality of, you are either with us or against us
[12:26:16] Lin'Garung: Hmm... but to us... actions agaisnt one... is an action against all
[12:26:44] Lin'Garung: This one wishes to think so
[12:26:57] Jack O'Sullivan: It's a nice way of thinking, Lin
[12:27:39] Lin'Garung: Indeed it is... It is nature to us...
[12:27:54] Jack O'Sullivan: I wish we were like that 
[12:28:01] Jack O'Sullivan: Sadly too selfish 
[12:28:50] Lin'Garung: This is partly due to how it is hard for this one to grasp the concept of fighting your own kind... And why this one still holds empathy towards the sullivan for fighting his own kind
[12:29:18] Jack O'Sullivan: As I said yesterday pal, It's nothing new for earth
[12:29:31] Jack O'Sullivan: Everyone has their own ideas of how things should be
[12:29:42] Jack O'Sullivan: And that causes conflict 
[12:30:03] Jack O'Sullivan: And we humans are too use to fixing conflict by the way of the sword
[12:30:27] Lin'Garung: A species thriving by the chaos of conflict
[12:30:34] Dropped "The raven named Charles" from server<STEAM_0:0:34463192>
[12:30:44] Jack O'Sullivan: You could say that
[12:30:48] Lin'Garung: Perhaps that is how we have come so far... agaisnt the combine...

[12:31:07] Lin'Garung: .// k
[12:31:38] Jack O'Sullivan: /looc back lad
[12:33:46] Lin'Garung: .// ahg
[12:34:52] Lin'Garung: How long has it been... since the sullivan had time to himself to "have a drink"
[12:35:41] Jack O'Sullivan: Uh.. Probably last had one in the city
[12:36:00] Jack O'Sullivan: Which is why I remember nothing of how I got here...
[12:36:06] Lin'Garung: Hmm
[12:36:30] Lin'Garung: That would hold true... Understood
[12:37:09] Jack O'Sullivan: why you ask?
[12:37:48] Lin'Garung: This one was curious... is it not the choice of the Sullivan indulge in such pleasures?
[12:37:59] Lin'Garung: .// to indulge
[12:38:12] Jack O'Sullivan: Pleasure eh
[12:38:18] Jack O'Sullivan: It's more so to forget
[12:38:26] Lin'Garung: Hmm?
[12:38:26] Jack O'Sullivan: How the world is..
[12:38:52] Jack O'Sullivan: We live in a world were my kind fight each other everyday
[12:38:58] Jack O'Sullivan: Do horrible stuff to each other
[12:39:07] Jack O'Sullivan: I drink to forget all this
[12:39:19] Lin'Garung: Hmm... 
[12:39:22] Jack O'Sullivan: And a small bit due to it tasting good
[12:39:53] Jack O'Sullivan: But
[12:40:06] Lin'Garung: But?
[12:40:13] Jack O'Sullivan: Being with your kind makes me not want to..
[12:40:20] Jack O'Sullivan: I envy your kind
[12:40:26] Jack O'Sullivan: You have such brotherhood
[12:40:38] Lin'Garung: It has always been in this one's nature
[12:40:45] Jack O'Sullivan: Indeed
[12:40:55] Jack O'Sullivan: And it is in our nature to be the opposite
[12:41:05] Jack O'Sullivan: Which makes me sad and envy your kinds
[12:41:09] Jack O'Sullivan: /looc kind*
[12:41:43] Lin'Garung: Yet... We all hold a common grudge toward a common enemy 
[12:41:56] Lin'Garung: Does that naturaly bring forth unity of its own kind?
[12:42:20] Jack O'Sullivan: Not for everyone
[12:42:27] Jack O'Sullivan: We split
[12:42:38] Jack O'Sullivan: As you have seen with the rebels and the loyalists
[12:42:56] Lin'Garung: Hmm...
[12:42:58] Jack O'Sullivan: This happens all to often with us
[12:43:24] Jack O'Sullivan: As I told you yesterday. Same shit, just a different name and logo
[12:43:40] Lin'Garung: It is true... This one does recall...
[12:43:56] Lin'Garung: A shame it is...
[12:44:02] Jack O'Sullivan: It really is..
[12:44:35] Jack O'Sullivan: Which is why I prefer being with vorts
[12:44:57] Lin'Garung: A hope for what could be?
[12:45:21] Jack O'Sullivan: No.. It will never be for us.. But it is just, nicer?
[12:45:34] Lin'Garung: Understood...
[12:45:50] Jack O'Sullivan: You don't argue, kill, rape, torture, steal and so on
[12:46:14] Lin'Garung: It is true... we do not
[12:47:00] Jack O'Sullivan: It is, certainty, knowing that I won't get yelled at out of no where due to someone having a bad mood swing
[12:47:18] Lin'Garung: What of this 'service man' you speak of?
[12:47:27] Lin'Garung: The one along side us
[12:47:38] Lin'Garung: This one has not gotten the chance to speak with them
[12:47:50] Jack O'Sullivan: I don't know him too well
[12:48:00] Jack O'Sullivan: He is one of my country men
[12:48:05] Jack O'Sullivan: But that doesn't change much
[12:48:10] Jack O'Sullivan: In the end he is still human
[12:48:18] Jack O'Sullivan: And humans are unpredictable
[12:48:43] Lin'Garung: Yet it does not look to this one that he has "sided" himself towards the exiles
[12:48:59] Lin'Garung: His actions following us are proof of such
[12:49:16] Jack O'Sullivan: Might be so for now
[12:49:33] Jack O'Sullivan: But you will never know what goes on inside a persons brain
[12:50:12] Jack O'Sullivan: Humans are, Masters of deception
[12:50:17] Jack O'Sullivan: Much like the combine...
[12:50:30] Lin'Garung: To us this is very much the case...
[12:50:46] Jack O'Sullivan: mhm..
[12:51:02] Jack O'Sullivan: It's just
[12:51:10] Jack O'Sullivan: you can't trust humans very well..
[12:51:25] Jack O'Sullivan: They will sell you out in a heartbeat if they have to
[12:51:32] Lin'Garung: Is this a warning for this one?
[12:51:42] Lin'Garung: Should this one not trust the Sullivan?
[12:52:10] Jack O'Sullivan: I'm not going to sugarcoat it but... I'm no saint
[12:52:30] Jack O'Sullivan: I sold out the exiles... To save the lady who got blown up
[12:53:03] Lin'Garung: Ahh...
[12:53:17] Jack O'Sullivan: I'm sorry..
[12:53:34] Lin'Garung: Honesty will go ways for the sullivan
[12:53:52] Jack O'Sullivan: Maybe towards you vorts.. but not to my kind
[12:53:58] Jack O'Sullivan: They would kill me if they knew
[12:54:14] Lin'Garung: And what of the lady then?
[12:54:18] Jack O'Sullivan: I won't even dare tell Hudson and Serviceman
[12:54:29] Jack O'Sullivan: The lady got help from the combine
[12:54:43] Jack O'Sullivan: She is fine now
[12:54:43] Lin'Garung: Hmm
[12:54:58] Jack O'Sullivan: She is staying in a house down in the town
[12:55:06] Lin'Garung: Ah...
[12:55:06] Jack O'Sullivan: With a small lad
[12:55:15] Lin'Garung: Small lad?
[12:55:30] Jack O'Sullivan: But.. I don't regret snitching on the exiles.. after what they did yesterday
[12:55:35] Jack O'Sullivan: Ah uh
[12:55:41] Jack O'Sullivan: He's a very small man
[12:55:48] Jack O'Sullivan: Shorter than you
[12:56:00] Lin'Garung: There is one... of your kind who appears small that would live just by the house near the river beside us
[12:56:26] Lin'Garung: They had lost a friend of their own...
[12:56:35] Jack O'Sullivan: Oh you know of him?
[12:56:50] Lin'Garung: Yes... and they know of this crystal aswell
[12:57:01] Lin'Garung: However this one cannot recall the name at which they go by
[12:57:12] Jack O'Sullivan: I sadly never got his name either
[12:57:23] Jack O'Sullivan: But he is also a fellow country man
[12:57:29] Jack O'Sullivan: Irish that is
[12:57:45] Lin'Garung: Yess
[12:57:46] Lin'Garung: Yess
[12:58:10] Jack O'Sullivan: But he helped me and the lady get through the mess yesterday
[12:58:37] Lin'Garung: If this one recalls... they are also a mechanic of sorts...
[12:58:50] Jack O'Sullivan: Oh that I don't know of
[12:59:01] Lin'Garung: Seem to be bountiful as of late
[12:59:14] Jack O'Sullivan: Hm?
[13:00:03] Lin'Garung: The 'service man', 'small Irish tongue... and the hudson all share this feild
[13:00:18] Jack O'Sullivan: Hudson is irish too?
[13:00:43] Lin'Garung: No... the small one you spoke of by the town
[13:00:50] Jack O'Sullivan: Ah yes
[13:01:09] Lin'Garung: three individuals this one can recall
[13:01:22] Jack O'Sullivan: Bit of a subject change but before I forget. I would never sell out you vorts
[13:01:32] Jack O'Sullivan: Yes we are three irishmen it seems
[13:02:03] Lin'Garung: We have come this far... 'selling' us out would seem pointless
[13:02:41] Jack O'Sullivan: You underestimate us humans..
[13:03:06] Lin'Garung: This one will remember this warning...
[13:03:51] Jack O'Sullivan: Don't think I would do so though
[13:03:54] Jack O'Sullivan: But others might
[13:04:14] Lin'Garung: Indeed... it is always a risk.
[13:04:14] Jack O'Sullivan: It's our instinct to do anything to survive
[13:05:03] Lin'Garung: I suppose that would be one of the causes to humanities endless conflicts
[13:05:12] Jack O'Sullivan: One of
[13:05:21] Jack O'Sullivan: Greed, pride
[13:05:24] Jack O'Sullivan: So on
[13:05:41] Lin'Garung: Indeed...
[13:06:11] Jack O'Sullivan: We humans could do so much more if we didn't waste so much time on useless stuff like conflict
[13:06:12] Jack O'Sullivan: But
[13:06:20] Jack O'Sullivan: Conflict has also brought some good
[13:06:27] Lin'Garung: Has it?
[13:06:47] Jack O'Sullivan: Do you know of atoms? Like radiation?
[13:07:25] Lin'Garung: Hmm... This kind field is foreign to this one
[13:07:43] Jack O'Sullivan: oh.. well, uh how do I explain in simple terms
[13:07:59] Jack O'Sullivan: Basically everything is made up of small atoms?
[13:08:09] Jack O'Sullivan: But
[13:08:15] Jack O'Sullivan: What I'm getting at is
[13:08:29] Jack O'Sullivan: There is a mineral on earth called uranium
[13:08:39] Jack O'Sullivan: This mineral holds a lot of these atoms
[13:08:52] Lin'Garung: Hmm...
[13:08:58] Jack O'Sullivan: And by messing with these atoms it can release a lot of energy
[13:09:18] Jack O'Sullivan: So when we humans first found out
[13:09:24] Jack O'Sullivan: We used it for something bad
[13:09:36] Jack O'Sullivan: We.. uh.. made bombs of it
[13:09:38] Lin'Garung: Oh... in conflict this one presumes...-
[13:09:51] Jack O'Sullivan: Very big confict
[13:10:00] Jack O'Sullivan: /looc conflict*
[13:10:13] Jack O'Sullivan: Was made and used by the americans
[13:10:22] Jack O'Sullivan: In a war we called world war 2
[13:10:53] Lin'Garung: Seems 'grand'...
[13:11:07] Jack O'Sullivan: Basically all of humanity fought each other
[13:11:13] Jack O'Sullivan: The whole planet
[13:11:25] Jack O'Sullivan: I forget how many died in it
[13:11:57] Lin'Garung: It still seems pointless... but please. The sullivan must continue
[13:11:59] Jack O'Sullivan: Something like 85 million?
[13:12:08] Jack O'Sullivan: Humans
[13:12:10] Jack O'Sullivan: Dead
[13:12:19] Lin'Garung: This one sees it as lost potential...
[13:12:27] Jack O'Sullivan: Very..
[13:12:39] Jack O'Sullivan: And yes it was very pointless
[13:12:41] Jack O'Sullivan: Again
[13:12:57] Jack O'Sullivan: Humans with different opinions fighting
[13:13:07] Lin'Garung: Has this bomb you speak of been used agaisnt the combine?
[13:13:25] Jack O'Sullivan: Wouldn't surprise me one bit
[13:13:38] Jack O'Sullivan: The bomb could level this whole area
[13:13:49] Lin'Garung: Hmm
[13:14:28] Lin'Garung: This one believes the costs to be far greater then...
[13:14:49] Lin'Garung: If such power does exsists
[13:14:57] Lin'Garung: .//exists
[13:15:23] Jack O'Sullivan: Well after the war and the americans had used two of them on a nation called japan
[13:15:31] Jack O'Sullivan: We found out it could be used for other stuff
[13:15:43] Jack O'Sullivan: Like producing electricity
[13:16:03] Jack O'Sullivan: And I guess micro ovens
[13:16:07] Lin'Garung: Hmm
[13:16:38] Lin'Garung: This one believes it does bring its own uses then..
[13:17:00] Jack O'Sullivan: Yes, but we had to go through 85 million humans to get it
[13:17:12] Lin'Garung: It is true...
[13:17:45] Lin'Garung: Yet with the conflict now.... Where both our races are on verge of extinction
[13:17:57] Lin'Garung: Does that not open the gates to creation?
[13:18:08] Jack O'Sullivan: For some probably
[13:18:18] Jack O'Sullivan: But we lack resources to creat
[13:19:14] Lin'Garung: /me Lifts the thermos with all three hands... "Then perhaps it soon may be time to indulge in the human spirit". Letting go placing it back in its third hand
[13:19:25] Lin'Garung: Untill then...
[13:19:33] Jack O'Sullivan: Indeed..
[13:19:38] Jack O'Sullivan: Although
[13:19:43] Lin'Garung: hmm?
[13:19:51] Jack O'Sullivan: you might of seen some of our human creativity 
[13:20:00] Jack O'Sullivan: Even if basic
[13:20:04] Lin'Garung: Indeed we have...
[13:20:37] Jack O'Sullivan: I heard about a man in prison who made a gun out of only simple stuff he could find in there
[13:20:41] Lin'Garung: We owe it to 'our' savour...
[13:20:51] Lin'Garung: Hmm?
[13:20:51] Jack O'Sullivan: Hm?
[13:21:01] Jack O'Sullivan: Your savour?
[13:21:15] Lin'Garung: One who shall not be named...
[13:21:27] Jack O'Sullivan: Ah.. okay
[13:21:46] Jack O'Sullivan: But I was saying that a guy in prison made a gun out of basic stuff
[13:21:57] Jack O'Sullivan: I don't really recall what it was made out of 
[13:22:02] Lin'Garung: resources would be limited...
[13:22:07] Jack O'Sullivan: Indeed
[13:22:16] Jack O'Sullivan: But he managed to do so anyway
[13:22:29] Lin'Garung: Impressive...
[13:22:35] Jack O'Sullivan: We humans are too good at making stuff that kills each other...
[13:22:45] Jack O'Sullivan: That we are masters off
[13:22:51] Jack O'Sullivan: /looc of*
[13:23:11] Jack O'Sullivan: Which.. makes me want to drink again..
[13:23:20] Lin'Garung: Hmm
[13:24:03] Lin'Garung: This one must apologize for reminding the Sullivan of such topics...
[13:24:13] Jack O'Sullivan: It's alright, Lin
[13:24:19] Jack O'Sullivan: Can't blame you
[13:24:39] Lin'Garung: Hmm...

[13:25:04] Lin'Garung: we are
[13:25:08] Jack O'Sullivan: Yea?
