[21:22:10] Metal Bender<STEAM_0:0:53897070> changed their name to Bob Howard
[21:22:11] CCA.C17-UNION.OfC.56321: /me let out something of a huff beneath his vocoder, upon further inspection in his hand would be a stack of 3 papers. Each looking to be of UU official business on furthering CCA operations and crackdowns on rebel authority. He'd keep his visors down at the papers whilst  listening to Alex.
[21:22:17] Kiff Sankase: .// man is on steroids
[21:22:22] Otto Von Habsburg: The excess dead skin has been removed, they are under so it'll be smooth sailing.
[21:22:28] CCA.C17-UNION.OfC.56321: A..... dead, CCA Unit?
[21:22:28] Alex Palovichov: And a i4 Union that didn't know we had a armory...
[21:22:31] CCA.C17-UNION.OfC.56321: Where?
[21:22:32] The Great Dictator<STEAM_0:1:35556367> changed their name to Don Joe
[21:22:34] Alex Palovichov: Yeah...
[21:22:37] Ashley Greene: Okay.. just- tell me what you need me to do and I'll do it.
[21:22:41] THE LEGENDRY BLACK CHICKEN: /me would slap into the crowbar with a meat wack befor falling ot the ground
[21:22:43] Otto Von Habsburg: They seem to be in a stable enough condition besides the bleeding, but the grafting should take care of that.
[21:22:46] Alex Palovichov: He used to be up stairs
[21:22:50] Richard Barley<STEAM_0:0:247487472> changed their name to Qul'jal
[21:22:56] Alex Palovichov: Next to the stairway leading to the lower nexus
[21:22:59] Qul'jal<STEAM_0:0:247487472> changed their name to Richard Barley
[21:23:03] Ava Carter: /r Kiff you see a tombstone at the Beach dont you dare mess with it
[21:23:08] Kiff Sankase: /me attempts to bring the edge of the axe onto the headcrab as it falls to the ground
[21:23:14] Finan O'Conall: /radio Who's it for?
[21:23:15] Kiff Sankase: .// what would i roll for that
[21:23:18] Alex Palovichov: Had to inform some units about it before they even tried to move it...Or acknowledge it
[21:23:22] THE LEGENDRY BLACK CHICKEN: .// agility?
[21:23:26] Ava Carter: /r someone who i knew
[21:23:29] Kiff Sankase: /rollskill agility
[21:23:31] Otto Von Habsburg: I need you to remove a subsection of skin from the mans arm in areas unburnt to we can sew it onto the areas to effectively cover the burned area, thin seems like it will do.
[21:23:34] Kiff Sankase: /rollattribute agility
[21:23:39] THE LEGENDRY BLACK CHICKEN: .// ouch

[21:23:48] Lin'Garung: .// youch
[21:23:49] CCA.C17-UNION.OfC.56321: /me stepped forward, shaking his head lightly as he waved the papers off, sending them to the floor as he closed in on the units body. He'd grasp upon it's mask, inspecting over it's corpse for any signs of how it died.
[21:23:50] Ava Carter: /r yes
[21:23:53] Richard Barley: Ah....
[21:23:53] Otto Von Habsburg: Ah, good, you are here to.
[21:24:03] Finan O'Conall: /radio Bollocks. God rest his kind soul.
[21:24:04] Ashley Greene: /me seems a little reluctant. ''Yeah-- okay, okay. I can- I can do that.''
[21:24:04] Richard Barley: Let me guess.... Re-education?
[21:24:05] Kiff Sankase: /me misses the headcrab by a longshot, slamming the axe head into the ground
[21:24:08] Otto Von Habsburg: No?
[21:24:11] Ashley Greene: .//thats a hell of a re-education
[21:24:11] THE LEGENDRY BLACK CHICKEN: /me does a barrel roll out the way of the ax
[21:24:13] Kiff Sankase: Good god
[21:24:17] Leon Taylor: good god
[21:24:19] Alex Palovichov: /it The body would be heavily burnt, half of the mask being charred...The units uniform having holes burnt in it
[21:24:22] Kiff Sankase: .// GALUNGA
[21:24:24] Otto Von Habsburg: He was burned severely and has third degree burns requiring skin grafting.
[21:24:25] THE LEGENDRY BLACK CHICKEN: good god
[21:24:26] Richard Barley: Oh... My mistake. Sometimes guys come out looking really bad
[21:24:27] Alex Palovichov: A apartment fire took him...
[21:24:28] Leon Taylor: wh
[21:24:29] Leon Taylor: what.
[21:24:32] Kiff Sankase: Uh?
[21:24:38] THE LEGENDRY BLACK CHICKEN: .// fuck, ment for looc
[21:24:40] Alex Palovichov: I believe he was one of the few units who even responded to it...
[21:24:42] Leon Taylor: .// ic now
[21:24:44] Kiff Sankase: I'm just hearing things I think
[21:24:47] Leon Taylor: .// headcrab spoke

[21:24:55] Lin'Garung: .// More reason to kill it
[21:24:59] THE LEGENDRY BLACK CHICKEN: .// FUCK
[21:25:01] Otto Von Habsburg: If you could help, it would be amazing, ointment has been applied and dead skin is removed, he is already hooked to IV.
[21:25:03] Leon Taylor: .// i forgot i had sonic frontiers open

[21:25:26] THE LEGENDRY BLACK CHICKEN: .// idk, the vorts wanna try and zap me past you two?
[21:25:26] Alex Palovichov: Every other unit seemed to take less interest in it...Until he died
[21:25:30] CCA.C17-UNION.OfC.56321: /me went dead silent for a moment, his silence deafening in fact, the only thing cutting through this silence being his vocoder occasionally picking up trace amounts of sound from his mouth, causing it to bleep to life, or Alex speaking. He'd let go of the corpses mask, shaking his head lightly. - "Who else was involved?"
[21:25:34] Richard Barley: I can hang around and help. Never did much in terms of skin grafting, but I can help.
[21:25:35] Adir'En: .// i got a nice view
[21:25:35] Kiff Sankase: .// oml if they hit us
[21:25:36] THE LEGENDRY BLACK CHICKEN: .// in close space

[21:25:42] Leon Taylor: .// the one vort has the space

[21:25:53] Kiff Sankase: .// lmao who was that dude
[21:25:54] Alex Palovichov: A Union i4...I think he ran in and saved a citizens life...
[21:26:01] CCA.C17-UNION.OfC.56321: Get him down here.
[21:26:01] THE LEGENDRY BLACK CHICKEN: .// a goof

[21:26:06] Richard Barley: /looc how tf have you been doing this with his suit on?
[21:26:07] CCA.C17-UNION.OfC.56321: Rather, I will 
[21:26:10] Otto Von Habsburg: Hm, from what I'm seeing, maybe a bit less than a cubic inch to cover the site.
[21:26:11] Ashley Greene: .//hes not suited ic

[21:26:18] Ava Carter: // headcrabs are godly frfr
[21:26:20] Adir'En: /me holds his hands together much like a prayer, speaking vortigese before unleashing a bolt of vortal energy.
[21:26:23] Lin'Garung: .// 1 good zap here and we got ourselfs some nice chicken
[21:26:26] Adir'En: .// what attribute or skill?

[21:26:59] Alex Palovichov: I think there was a Judge too, but I believe he took little interest in helping...Or at least until the unit died...
[21:27:00] Otto Von Habsburg: We'll need to do the same for the head, but that section is smaller, the rest of the burn seems like it can be healed over time due to it not being an open wound.
[21:27:05] Leon Taylor: .// constitution is how much u can take damage wise
[21:27:10] Adir'En: .// ok doing con, maskes sense
[21:27:11] CCA.C17-UNION.OfC.56321: /r Any JUDGE units that participated in that fire?
[21:27:12] Kiff Sankase: .// i'd say agility
[21:27:14] Ashley Greene: /me nods, taking a deep breath. ''Got it.'' She'd semi-confidently say, before beginning to do exactly as instructed. Unfortunately, I have literally no experience nor knowledge IRL of skin grafting, so you get this /me full of filler text.

[21:31:38] CCA.C17-UNION.OfC.56321: /me nodded to himself lightly, unlatching a PDA from his utility belt. He'd switch it over, lightly tapping along the now iluminated blue screen, swiping along CCA IDs it seems.
[21:31:40] Ava Carter: /r no unless authorized to

[21:32:41] Otto Von Habsburg: Next, we have some medical glue in the cabinet, we'll apply it using that due to I assume it being the least invasive, stiches and stables seem like a bad idea in this case.
[21:32:43] CCA.C17-UNION.OfC.56321: /me he'd look up from the PDA within his hands towards the Unit, nodding to himself lightly. - "You two were involved in a fire situation recently, correct?"
[21:32:44] Leon Taylor: The only other place I can think of is *in* the city.

[21:36:27] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: I put that fire out all on my own. Once the unit had signaled a biosignal malfunction, I raced to the scene, opened the door and was created by flames, I then proceeded to put out the fire when this unit to my left showed up at the end.

[21:36:56] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: Someone had to run and retrieve suppressants.
[21:37:01] Paul-Henri Cartier: .// both of you roll
[21:37:02] Leon Taylor: .// roll + roll = value
[21:37:06] Alex Palovichov: So you walked?
[21:37:09] Otto Von Habsburg: I mean, that's a fair area to transplant. A lot of pre-war doctors reccomended it.
[21:37:10] Paul-Henri Cartier: .// yeah

[21:37:32] Alex Palovichov: And last I saw, the Union was on scene WITH a fire suppresor while you continued to slowly walk
[21:37:41] Ashley Greene: Oh- no, I was just.. dealing with the stress by making a light hearted semi-joke.
[21:37:51] Richard Barley: /looc Im reading the OTA guide rn and CCA guide. Not too bad, but both make me want to put a bullet in my head.
[21:37:51] Adir'En: /vort At the moment of strike, shall we release our vortal energy!
[21:38:02] Lin'Garung: /vort That we shall!
[21:38:04] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: I will say this here and now. I put out the fire alone, I brought the unit back and asked another to bag him up so I could relieve Helix and then work the desk. I work hard for this job,  and I work constantly and still have barely to show for it. Give me your deliberation and or punishment now and be done with it please.
[21:38:09] Otto Von Habsburg: Well your joke turned out to be a realistic option. Either way, lets get this done.

[21:38:23] Otto Von Habsburg: /looc I read the CCA guide in full, not OTA
[21:38:29] Richard Barley: /looc OTA you need i3
[21:38:31] Leon Taylor: If we manage to get in, I don't think it should be a move straight away.
[21:38:32] Lin'Garung: /me More green energies would collect around his palm as it waits for the other
[21:38:37] Ashley Greene: .// Fuck lmao nothing on the ota app itself said that
[21:38:39] Leon Taylor: Keep both, until you're positive the other is compromised.
[21:38:46] Alex Palovichov: That Union sat there alone for quite some time keeping the fire from spreading...Alone
[21:38:51] Richard Barley: /looc yeah, Q and other CCA say you need i3
[21:38:54] Kiff Sankase: Gotcha
[21:39:00] Kiff Sankase: .// that fucking door
[21:39:01] Adir'En: /vort THE VORTESSENCE IS CHANNELED, IT IS TIME! STRIKE!
[21:39:05] Ashley Greene: May I just watch for this one? I'd.. rather just learn, for now, especially with such an important region
[21:39:11] Richard Barley: /looc Continue with the medRP and we can just continue after
[21:39:13] Otto Von Habsburg: Sure.
[21:39:21] Derrek Thornberry: /looc back
[21:39:28] Otto Von Habsburg: Let me actually just get some santized gloves first.
[21:39:29] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: I never told that unit to run into that fire alone. He did it all by himself.
[21:39:30] Richard Barley: /looc Great application, I found only one issue with what you wrote, question 3. I'll go back over the guide, I could make it more clear myself, I left it up a little too up for interpretation. An autonomous unit is one under Dispatch's full control rather than under the control of the CCA. Otherwise, well done. Assuming you have an i3 or higher, you have been
[21:39:32] CCA.C17-UNION.OfC.56321: /me looked back up from his PDA, flicking it off and attaching it to his utility belt. - "You'll be allowed off this once, however the lack of respect for this units corpse is noted for you and whatever HELIX was around, -15 rank points."
[21:39:39] Alex Palovichov: Run into that fire?
[21:39:43] Richard Barley: /looc that is from an accepted app a bit ago
[21:39:47] Ashley Greene: .// huh, i see
[21:39:49] Alex Palovichov: You are aware fire can blow doors off...
[21:39:53] Alex Palovichov: Or at least open
[21:39:55] Richard Barley: /looc So you do need i3 to app for OTA
[21:39:55] Lin'Garung: /me Releases his energy forward, as its arms move infront of him a large green blast hits the door
[21:39:57] Otto Von Habsburg: /me grabs a new set of sanitized medical gloves, before moving over to the sink and washing his hands again just in case.
[21:39:58] Adir'En: /it At the moment of the final chant, the vortigaunts release a beam of vortal energy upon the wall.
[21:40:04] CCA.C17-JUDGE.i4.77460: The door was closed when I approached and his body was inside...

[21:40:15] Derrek Thornberry: /looc did I live?

He then (once it is set correctly) takes out a medical glue and uses the adhesive to attach the graft fully to the forehead along the edges, securing it.
