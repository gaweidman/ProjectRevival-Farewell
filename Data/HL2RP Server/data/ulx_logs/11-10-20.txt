[15:46:05] CCA.C14-JUDGE.i5.22767: Sure come with me
[15:48:06] Dustin Rory: I found a possible massive fucking base.
[15:48:12] CCA.C14-JUDGE.i5.22767: Where at?
[15:48:30] Dustin Rory: Near the canals, it's a fake brick wall, seems a lot like a secret door.
[15:48:37] CCA.C14-JUDGE.i5.22767: Mind showing me where it is?
[15:49:09] Dustin Rory: Looking at the fact that you're CCA, it would probably be a big breach of protocol for you to see it....looking at it being under ground.
[15:49:27] CCA.C14-JUDGE.i5.22767: If it's underground then there must be an above ground entrance
[15:49:37] Dustin Rory: I can show you that atleast.
[15:50:32] Dustin Rory: This is the fastest way to it
[15:50:44] Dustin Rory: A rope goes down, it's pretty obvious
[15:51:04] CCA.C14-JUDGE.i5.22767: Alright, I can make a report of this and try to get a team to investigate it.
[15:51:08] Dustin Rory: The only groups I know that could make a decent fake wall would probably be lambda or similar in strength.
[15:51:15] Dustin Rory: And one more thing
[15:51:39] Dustin Rory: Justin Bail the rebel piece of shit went down this entrance, probably found his way into the base.
[15:51:42] CCA.C14-JUDGE.i5.22767: yuck
[15:51:48] Dustin Rory: Heh, me and you both.
[15:52:11] Dustin Rory: Trust me, I wanted to infiltrate the base and sever his lower spine so he can't run away.
[15:52:25] Dustin Rory: I can probably still do it, atleast if the gate keeper is somebody I know.
[15:52:43] Dustin Rory: Probably a Watcher, so I can get into it easily.
[15:53:05] CCA.C14-JUDGE.i5.22767: Well if we can bust the entire base and the people in it, that's a heafty sum of LP for you.
[15:53:56] Dustin Rory: Indeed so, some massive bunker gates lead into the same general area....my best guess is that it's a pre-war bunker that the Rebels are using for protection
[15:54:13] CCA.C14-JUDGE.i5.22767: Well we can see how well they hold up
[15:54:40] Dustin Rory: I'll see if I can infiltrate it later, if the CCA doesn't mind....considering what i've done already, i'm sure you don't mind
[15:54:49] CCA.C14-JUDGE.i5.22767: Do what you must
[15:55:06] Dustin Rory: Alright, thats about all I can do for you right now.
