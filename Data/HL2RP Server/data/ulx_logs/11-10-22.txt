[00:37:29] Gregory: .// aspect is super smart
[00:37:29] Andrew Cloverman: .//i think he was being like

[00:37:39] Andrew Cloverman: .//but i wasl ike "nonononno shit that's a good fucking idea"
[00:37:44] Andrew Cloverman: .//and then i added it half a year later lmao
[00:37:48] Andrew Cloverman: .//the glow was my own idea
[00:37:51] Andrew Cloverman: .//tooltip was my own idea
[00:37:52] Gregory: .// ok but when do we get the ability to pick our placement of locks
[00:37:57] Andrew Cloverman: .//what do you mean
[00:37:59] Gregory: .// like positioning
[00:38:08] Gregory: .// or does that already exist in a way
[00:38:11] Gregory: .// ive not locked anything yetr
[00:38:12] Andrew Cloverman: .//no it doesn't
[00:38:22] Andrew Cloverman: .//the lock shows up based on the bounds of the model
[00:38:25] Gregory: .//ah
[00:38:29] Andrew Cloverman: .//the center of the front face
[00:38:35] Andrew Cloverman: .//it works for most things except a few
[00:38:41] Andrew Cloverman: .//cash registers i know don't show up right
[00:38:46] Andrew Cloverman: .//but it works for the big stuff
[00:38:51] Andrew Cloverman: .//yeah i fucking love the glowing combine locks
[00:39:03] Andrew Cloverman: .//small thing but very worthi t
[00:39:04] Gregory: .// i am curious rq;
[00:39:09] Gregory: .// why did you go for an instant gas system that just like
[00:39:12] Gregory: .// spam attacks your health
[00:39:15] Andrew Cloverman: .//i will tell you
[00:39:16] Gregory: .// and not something that builds up overtime
[00:39:17] Andrew Cloverman: .//the answer is easy
[00:39:34] Andrew Cloverman: .//let me set my hugner and thirst first
[00:39:37] Andrew Cloverman: .//becuasei  am getting annoyed
[00:39:39] Gregory: .//bro is dying
[00:39:42] Andrew Cloverman: /charsethunger andrew 100
[00:39:46] Andrew Cloverman: /charsetthirst andrew 100
[00:39:52] Andrew Cloverman: .//i was lazy when i wrote this
[00:39:57] Gregory: .// pfft
[00:39:58] Andrew Cloverman: .//and it's literally just a heavily modified
[00:40:04] Andrew Cloverman: .//version of liquid's gas system
[00:40:08] Gregory: .//ah 
[00:40:12] Andrew Cloverman: .//like i just repurposed it to be global
[00:40:17] Andrew Cloverman: .//and then added in my own fil;ter thing
[00:40:23] Andrew Cloverman: .//the idea of having it build up over time
[00:40:23] Gregory: .// bilwin put out a pretty good gas system that does exactly what im describing
[00:40:26] Gregory: .// but not global
[00:40:27] Andrew Cloverman: .//it hadn't occured to me
[00:40:35] Andrew Cloverman: .//personally though i don't like that idea with gas
[00:40:43] Andrew Cloverman: .//it works a lot better on willard where you have xen sporesa
[00:40:49] Gregory: .// god i fucking love their gas system
[00:40:50] Andrew Cloverman: .//i think that makes a lot more RP sense
[00:40:53] Gregory: .// i didnt experience it firsthand
[00:40:56] Gregory: .// but i know it's very nice
[00:40:57] Andrew Cloverman: .//it's really cool
[00:41:09] Andrew Cloverman: .//the xen spores idea was smart
[00:41:18] Andrew Cloverman: .//but yeah the idea of slow buildup never came to me
[00:41:24] Andrew Cloverman: .//but i wouldn't even do it for gas having that idea now
[00:41:24] Gregory: .//not evne slow just
[00:41:26] Gregory: .// a grace period
[00:41:33] Andrew Cloverman: .//that's ture
[00:41:39] Andrew Cloverman: .//slowing dow nthe damage would be nice too
[00:41:41] Andrew Cloverman: .//but a grace period
[00:41:45] Gregory: .// or even just a warning on the filter time 
[00:41:49] Andrew Cloverman: .//i'll put that in my own suggestions channel
[00:41:56] Andrew Cloverman: .//that i cosndiered i'm pretty sure
[00:42:02] Andrew Cloverman: .//but it felt a little too gamey
[00:42:07] Andrew Cloverman: .//i felt like it would break immersion
[00:42:11] Gregory: .// Metro Exodus does it really well
[00:42:19] Gregory: .// it plays a little chime when your filter is about to run out, but it sbased on your watch
[00:42:24] Andrew Cloverman: .//that's smart
[00:42:27] Gregory: .// since that game does not use many menus
[00:42:30] Andrew Cloverman: .//yeah, it would make more sense if you had a smart suit
[00:42:36] Andrew Cloverman: .//that owuld work well on the CWU suit
[00:42:39] Gregory: .//yeah
[00:42:40] Andrew Cloverman: .//it would make sense
[00:42:45] Andrew Cloverman: .//also look at my eyes when i turn off my flashlight
[00:42:49] Gregory: .// woah
[00:42:54] Andrew Cloverman: .//super small thing
[00:42:56] Andrew Cloverman: .//but so fucking cool
[00:43:01] Gregory: .// question; why do respirators not use filters
[00:43:04] Gregory: .// unintentional oversight?
[00:43:14] Andrew Cloverman: .//no, that was a genuine idea 
[00:43:27] Andrew Cloverman: .//the repsirators were added in originally to allow for more customization
[00:43:39] Andrew Cloverman: .//because i forgot when putting everybodfy in suits that, oh hey, you only have two appearance options
[00:43:43] Gregory: .// invisible respirator for use in custom-placed respirator fr
[00:44:05] Gregory: .// what i do for my character is i have the actual suit on, but i had DRD set my model to a normal citizen
[00:44:08] Andrew Cloverman: .//but then i figured "well, it might as well be better than a suit." so i figured the best way to be an upgrade other than allowing more customization was making it not take filters
[00:44:10] Gregory: .// and i've PAC'd my respirator on
[00:44:19] Gregory: .// so i get the aesthetics of the respirator but unfrotunately i have to get filters
[00:44:35] Andrew Cloverman: .//and then i figured i'd just make it more expensive and have it be more balanced with having a suit and keeping buying filters
[00:44:46] Andrew Cloverman: .//it wasn't a super great idea
[00:44:49] Gregory: .//respirator is too cheap imo but also its a QoL thing and it shouldnt be super expensive
[00:44:51] Andrew Cloverman: .//i have very mixed feelings aobut it
[00:44:53] Andrew Cloverman: .//yeah
[00:44:59] Gregory: .// the gas is intrusive as hell so an easy solution to it is very nice
[00:45:03] Andrew Cloverman: .//exactly
[00:45:06] Gregory: .// the filters being cheap as fuck maket he suits nice
[00:45:11] Gregory: .// make the suits bearable*
[00:45:14] Andrew Cloverman: .//bearable yeah
[00:45:18] Andrew Cloverman: .//no i agree the suits aren't idea
[00:45:21] Andrew Cloverman: .//ideal
[00:45:26] Andrew Cloverman: .//but t's part of it
[00:45:26] Gregory: .// now add cca filters
[00:45:29] Gregory: .// inb4 you already have them
[00:45:30] Andrew Cloverman: .//WE HAVE THEM
[00:45:34] Gregory: .// LMAO
[00:45:34] Andrew Cloverman: .//WE HAVE THME FOR SO MANY THINGS
[00:45:36] Andrew Cloverman: .//LOOK AT TIHS
[00:45:38] Andrew Cloverman: /adminspawnmenu
[00:45:47] Gregory: .// i feel like theres a ton of content im yet to experience
[00:45:57] Andrew Cloverman: .//THEY ALL DO MORE AND MORE TIME
[00:46:01] Andrew Cloverman: //CITIZEN FILTERS GIVE YOU AN HOUR
[00:46:03] Andrew Cloverman: .//WRONG CHAT
[00:46:13] Andrew Cloverman: .//CONSCRIPT FILTERS GIVE YOU 90 minutes i think?
[00:46:21] Andrew Cloverman: .//CCA is 120?
[00:46:26] Andrew Cloverman: .//and then OTA is 240?
[00:46:27] Andrew Cloverman: .//i think?
[00:46:30] Andrew Cloverman: .//or something like that
[00:46:33] Gregory: .// lol i think theres an ota filter under there 
[00:46:35] Andrew Cloverman: .//but itr goes up
[00:46:35] Gregory: .// it rolled under
[00:46:40] Andrew Cloverman: .//got it
[00:46:49] Andrew Cloverman: .//anyways we do have CCA filters and other faction filters
[00:46:59] Andrew Cloverman: .//they all givef you more time than regular citizne iflters
[00:47:02] Gregory: .// nice
[00:47:06] Andrew Cloverman: .//right?
[00:47:13] Andrew Cloverman: .//i need to look at apps
[00:47:16] Andrew Cloverman: .//and make the work list
[00:47:18] Andrew Cloverman: .//i will say
[00:47:20] Gregory: .// there are two staff apps by two cool people
[00:47:24] Andrew Cloverman: .//HL2TS2 has some edgy stuff
[00:47:30] Gregory: .// also this is 100% just me saying this as a suggestion because i enjoy it but;
[00:47:36] Gregory: .// you should move over from the pill pack, it's
[00:47:38] Gregory: .// an outdated mess
[00:47:43] Andrew Cloverman: .//yeah, i don't disagree
[00:47:47] Andrew Cloverman: .//it's one of those thing sthat was just
[00:47:50] Andrew Cloverman: .//convenient at hte time
[00:47:51] Gregory: .// drgbase or vj base is superior, i'm extremely biased towards drgbase because i'm pretty good at it
[00:47:55] Andrew Cloverman: .//moreso than going through zombie sweps
[00:47:59] Gregory: .// nah man fuck sweps 
[00:48:01] Andrew Cloverman: .//and testing tghem all out
[00:48:02] Gregory: .// im talkin' full npcs
[00:48:03] Andrew Cloverman: .//bro?
[00:48:08] Gregory: .// go big or go home
[00:48:09] Andrew Cloverman: .//like player controlled NPCs
[00:48:12] Gregory: .//yeah
[00:48:16] Gregory: .// one sec lemme get a video 
[00:48:17] Andrew Cloverman: .//i haven't thought about that
[00:48:22] Gregory: .//it smy specialty
[00:48:31] Andrew Cloverman: .//HL2TS2 has some degy stuff but some of their clothing options i really like
[00:48:49] Gregory: .// sent over an mp4 of an npc i worked on for a bit then scrapped bc i got bored

[00:49:19] Gregory: .// ts2 is a classic
[00:49:20] Andrew Cloverman: .//like it's a little gruff but
[00:49:27] Andrew Cloverman: .//i woudlkn't call it edgy like osme of the other stuff

[00:49:52] Andrew Cloverman: .//i want to take some stuff from HL2TS2
[00:50:01] Andrew Cloverman: .//i would probably commission someone to remake them in HDS
[00:50:02] Andrew Cloverman: .//HD
[00:50:05] Andrew Cloverman: //or higher definition at least
[00:50:09] Gregory: .// that would be nice

[00:50:19] Gregory: .// 50/50 if itll be good or bad

[00:51:27] Gregory: .// too sci-fi
[00:51:28] Andrew Cloverman: .//absolutely hate it
[00:51:31] Andrew Cloverman: .//way too sci-fi
[00:51:43] Andrew Cloverman: .//part of the raeson i didn't use HL2TS2 was because it's not uniform
[00:51:53] Andrew Cloverman: .//the head bodygroup especially varies a lot based on the model
[00:52:10] Andrew Cloverman: .//so only a few models can wear welder's masks

[00:56:18] Gregory: .// i ported the wrong model so the skin is off
[00:56:41] Andrew Cloverman: .//because they just don't have female citizens in suits except for the resonance pack
