[19:19:39] Leon Taylor: The the thing above the ladder.
[19:19:48] Ava Carter: what
[19:19:49] James Van der Linde: /me submerged the mop into the bucket of water before rising it back up from the bucket afterwards and allowing to some of the water to drip out. After a few seconds of doing this, he'd move to corner on the left of the laundry machines and began his work there. He'd first sweep left to right in the small corner and making sure to drag away any dirt, dust or filth in the corner to the middle of the room along with his sweeps, using the mop as not only to clean dried filth that usually a broom couldn't handle but also using it as a broom at the same time, sweeping the dust and dirt away from the ground.
[19:19:49] Ava Carter: show
[19:19:54] Robbert Garth: /me Follows up with his cloth once again only this time starting from the bottem working his way up sweeping the cloth side to side

[19:23:47] Robbert Garth: /me uses his cloth switching between both panes of the glass going from bottom to the top of the panes
[19:23:57] James Van der Linde: /me after doing this, he'd continue his left to right motions on the center of the room, going from one side to the other. He'd make sure that the mop would clean the dirty areas around the bench along with removing any dust and dragging them to the middle of the room, forming a small pile of dirtiness as he continued sweeping to the left and right. As he met the combine terminal, he'd make sure to clean the lower base of the terminal to make sure it was clean and dirt-free just like how any combine terminal should be. After all this, he'd sweep all the piled up filth and drag it away into the door that led to the room.
[19:24:31] Gregory: ribbit 2

[19:25:36] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.54487: You can just use the mop and put it back in the bucket.
[19:25:41] Robbert Garth: /me continues scrubing the windows commenting to the game "ouch, wrong move"
[19:25:43] James Van der Linde: Gotcha.
[19:25:48] Gregory: mlem 1

[19:28:53] James Van der Linde: /me grabbed the mop's head and twisted it firmly on top of the bucket, allowing all the water still in the mop to be removed. After so, he'd continue sweeping the pile dirt out to the double doors, making sure to not let any dirt or dust be left behind as he sweeped it all to the double door, before opening it and sweeping it out to the main street, allowing the wind and the cremators deal with the rest.

[19:56:15] Adir'En: There is much to the crystal...
[19:56:42] Adir'En: This one has yet to experience visions, as the QuI does.

[20:17:37] Ava Carter: trust me he says he has a plan
[20:17:37] James Van der Linde: Calm down. I was dragged into most jobs alright.
[20:17:47] Adir'En: .// IVE GOT A PLAN ARTHURD
[20:17:50] James Van der Linde: Not a plan I wanted to go through with at fucking all
[20:17:57] Lin'Garung: .// lol
[20:18:04] Adir'En: .// TAHITI ARTHUR
[20:18:07] James Van der Linde: Because if my ass got caught red handed, I'd be fucking french fries.
[20:18:17] James Van der Linde: I'd have to find a ride to somewhere far away from here.
[20:18:20] James Van der Linde: I dunno, tahiti?
[20:18:24] Adir'En: The Combine would take no act lightly...
[20:18:25] James Van der Linde: is that even a thing anymore?
[20:18:30] Paul-Henri Cartier: the fucks a Tahiti?
[20:18:41] James Van der Linde: It's an island. Close to Australia.
[20:18:44] Ava Carter: /looc imagine
[20:18:53] James Van der Linde: Me and an old group of friends used to want to move there.
[20:18:54] Ava Carter: /looc not knowing tahiti in hl2 rp
[20:19:04] James Van der Linde: Then the combine did their fucking shit.
[20:19:05] Paul-Henri Cartier: ah
[20:19:19] Lin'Garung: .// damn he really went with it
[20:19:33] Ava Carter: // brb
[20:19:35] James Van der Linde: /looc TBH I JUST WENT WITH IT CUZ YOU DID THE MEMES ON /LOOC
[20:19:42] Adir'En: .// lol it worked tho
[20:19:45] Lin'Garung: Perhaps with such access... we may be able to aquire the information we seek...
[20:19:55] Adir'En: Hmmm....
[20:20:09] Lin'Garung: This one is not in level with the combines network...
[20:20:25] Lin'Garung: The Cartier shall comment on the matter...
[20:20:39] James Van der Linde: I mean, maybe but if I do go through with it, ya'll better have a plan to pull my ass away from the firing line.
[20:20:51] James Van der Linde: If shit does hit the fan.
[20:21:00] Paul-Henri Cartier: lok, friend
[20:21:15] Paul-Henri Cartier: if you infiltrate the CCA and get caught, a firing line would be something to look forward to
[20:21:19] Adir'En: /vort Those secrets The Combine holds would give to no new member... If Van der Linde were to find out, alligence is in quesiton.
[20:21:21] Paul-Henri Cartier: there are fathes worse than death.
[20:21:27] Paul-Henri Cartier: especially for spies
[20:21:29] James Van der Linde: So have I heard.
[20:21:31] Paul-Henri Cartier: .// fates
[20:21:52] Ava Carter: /looc there are fathers worse than death
[20:21:59] James Van der Linde: /looc ngl thats true
[20:22:00] Ava Carter: /looc #1 zeus
[20:22:11] James Van der Linde: /looc zeus was just too horny
[20:22:15] Lin'Garung: /vort This is true... However greater insight on their workings may prove beneficial
[20:22:23] Adir'En: /vort Agreed...
[20:22:29] Ava Carter: so 
[20:22:34] Ava Carter: what is the verdict?
[20:22:48] James Van der Linde: Feel like we'd want Jacob's opinion on this.
[20:22:51] Ava Carter: yes he inlists into the CP and spies?
[20:22:56] James Van der Linde: maybe even Baron's opinions.
[20:22:58] Ava Carter: or no we dont want him to die
[20:23:11] Lin'Garung: Hmm...
[20:23:14] Paul-Henri Cartier: an i5 isn't likely to have access to anything of strategic importance
[20:23:19] Lin'Garung: Yet how may we trust the Linde...
[20:23:24] Ava Carter: true
[20:23:25] Ava Carter: but
[20:23:27] Paul-Henri Cartier: and if you were to advances in the ranks, well...
[20:23:32] Lin'Garung: This one can only recall the name for moments...
[20:23:36] Adir'En: Insights into the crystal and motives may be at hand, but to arrive at such information calls to question motives...
[20:23:37] Paul-Henri Cartier: you, more likely than not, would be against us
[20:23:38] Ava Carter: an i5 has access to gear
[20:23:48] Ava Carter: gear WE NEED
[20:23:50] James Van der Linde: I mean, you're an i1.
[20:23:54] James Van der Linde: Or was.
[20:23:55] Paul-Henri Cartier: an i5?
[20:24:01] James Van der Linde: From what I can see in your uniform.
[20:24:03] Paul-Henri Cartier: nine milimeter pistol, three magazines...
[20:24:18] Ava Carter: what about
[20:24:24] Ava Carter: the conscripts?
[20:24:27] Paul-Henri Cartier: access to their radio frequency would be nice
[20:24:28] Ava Carter: eh?
[20:24:38] James Van der Linde: Conscripts? Hell nah.
[20:24:42] Ava Carter: why not
[20:24:50] James Van der Linde: They're *conscripts*.
[20:24:51] Paul-Henri Cartier: all conscripts recieve unionwashing.
[20:24:53] James Van der Linde: It's in the name.
[20:24:58] Ava Carter: ah
[20:24:59] James Van der Linde: Along with that.
[20:25:00] Paul-Henri Cartier: well
[20:25:05] Ava Carter: /me sighs
[20:25:06] Paul-Henri Cartier: the actual name is Human Earth Military
[20:25:07] Ava Carter: well damn
[20:25:33] James Van der Linde: Eh, I've heard them being called Conscripts. Doesn't matter anyways.
[20:25:50] Ava Carter: going out
[20:25:50] Lin'Garung: Hmm...
[20:25:53] James Van der Linde: But, in this case.
[20:25:54] Ava Carter: gonna scavenge
[20:26:01] James Van der Linde: You were an intetion one, yes?
[20:26:03] Ava Carter: // brb
[20:26:20] James Van der Linde: Assuming you were once an actual unit.
[20:26:31] Paul-Henri Cartier: i1, GRID.
[20:26:40] Paul-Henri Cartier: i was due for a promotion, actually.
[20:27:13] Adir'En: The Combine had The Paul as an ally once? 
[20:27:13] James Van der Linde: Right. I assume that I1 still don't get any sort of brainwashing yet, yeah?
[20:27:47] Lin'Garung: It would seem not...
[20:28:18] Paul-Henri Cartier: no, they do.
[20:28:25] Paul-Henri Cartier: it's not fun to talk about.
[20:28:36] James Van der Linde: Ah... I, understand.
[20:28:48] Lin'Garung: Where do the Van Der Linde motivations lie...?
[20:28:56] Adir'En: The Paul must have encounder a force of great magnitude, to work with those against The Combine...
[20:29:04] Lin'Garung: Why would the Linde go to such risks...
[20:29:20] Paul-Henri Cartier: you have *no* idea, Adir. It was bizzare.
[20:29:21] James Van der Linde: Well, I am more asking out of curiosity and to know how hard it'd be.
[20:29:41] Adir'En: This one is intrigued. Perhaps The Paul could tell the tale...at a later time...
[20:29:42] Lin'Garung: Yet... now...
[20:29:43] James Van der Linde: I'm not enlisting unless there is a decently well thought plan in the case I get busted.
[20:29:55] Lin'Garung: If the Linde were to side with the combine...
[20:30:08] Lin'Garung: It would be the greatestliability 
[20:30:12] Lin'Garung: .// liability
[20:30:32] James Van der Linde: Well, anyone here could side with the combine.
[20:30:42] Paul-Henri Cartier: i'd be happy to
[20:30:52] Adir'En: Not everyone...
[20:31:00] Ava Carter: // back
[20:31:01] Lin'Garung: Yet *we* all know eachothers goals...
[20:31:05] James Van der Linde: Use us as barganing chips for say... being reintroduced back into the life.
[20:31:16] James Van der Linde: /looc into the life of a citizen*
[20:31:24] Ava Carter: // first find, conscript filter!
[20:31:34] James Van der Linde: You gotta have trust in *everyone* in this group.
[20:31:52] James Van der Linde: Very easy to someone simply sweep a leg under you.
[20:32:03] Lin'Garung: This one has just met the Linde... and has yet to understand your motivations... 
[20:32:35] James Van der Linde: Like I said, I'm not enlisting unless everyone in this place asks me to do so.
[20:32:56] James Van der Linde: Along with, like I said, a plan to help me get out of that place in case I'm found out.
[20:33:12] Lin'Garung: Has the Linde gone through any hardship? with the combine that is...
[20:33:58] James Van der Linde: Lost my friends. A lot of them. Good people, we drank, partied and worked together.
[20:34:10] Lin'Garung: .// Wish i could roll for insight :P
[20:34:27] Ava Carter<STEAM_0:1:429480781> changed their name to Bird
[20:34:29] James Van der Linde: Some are dead. Long gone now. Some are still alive but... god knows where.
[20:34:29] Lin'Garung: Hmm...
[20:34:32] Adir'En: .// imagine the full stat array from DND
[20:34:33] Bird: // brb again
[20:34:49] Lin'Garung: /rollskill insight
[20:35:00] Lin'Garung: .// Guess its not a skill 
[20:35:03] James Van der Linde: /looc cant you just do a normal roll
[20:35:06] Lin'Garung: .// could be one to suggest tho
[20:35:12] James Van der Linde: /looc and like, oocly add to that number?
[20:35:20] James Van der Linde: /looc like, add +15 cuz you're a vort
[20:35:23] Lin'Garung: .// Im down
[20:35:46] Lin'Garung: .// that is if your trying to deceive
[20:36:03] James Van der Linde: /looc find out ic brother
[20:36:03] Lin'Garung: /roll
[20:36:04] Adir'En: .// the only real issue, and im not trying to sound mean, is that anyone can just lie through it anyway and not try to do it in good faith
[20:36:18] James Van der Linde: /looc my brother, there is a super admin in here
[20:36:21] Lin'Garung: .// it is true...
[20:36:26] James Van der Linde: /looc the results i give are gonna stick in my ass
[20:36:26] Paul-Henri Cartier: .// hi
[20:36:28] James Van der Linde: /looc damn hard
[20:36:31] Lin'Garung: .// yeah but lieing about backstory is different
[20:36:32] Adir'En: .// there are alot of people that would ignore that
[20:36:34] James Van der Linde: /looc so i cant lie about it
[20:36:41] Adir'En: .// thats somehting you and only you know bro
[20:36:49] Adir'En: .// how your charatcer feels?
[20:36:56] Adir'En: .// SA dont read minds
[20:37:05] James Van der Linde: /looc i mean towards the rolls
[20:37:30] Adir'En: .// I mean if the roll is good to determine if its a lie, anyone can just say "im not lying, you believe it"
[20:37:47] Adir'En: .// thats what im getitng at, not the physical roll itself
[20:38:01] James Van der Linde: /looc fair enough, but, it's the best i can do to put you at ease
[20:38:19] Adir'En: .// nah you good, id believe you, im just saying thats a foctor you have to worry about with insight
[20:38:33] Adir'En: .// its an issue in DND as well
[20:38:35] James Van der Linde: /looc there is a server i played in that had vort classes
[20:38:41] Lin'Garung: .// In any case 64+ the agreed 15 :)
[20:38:49] Lin'Garung: .// the whitelisted one?
[20:38:59] James Van der Linde: /looc like Seer, Warrior, Healer, Conjurer and Enchanter
[20:39:06] Lin'Garung: .// I heard about it from gridlock i think
[20:39:08] Adir'En: .// id fuck with vort classes tbh
[20:39:13] Lin'Garung: .// didnt join thi
[20:39:15] Lin'Garung: .// tho
[20:39:21] James Van der Linde: /looc yeah, it's called pandora's box
[20:39:24] Lin'Garung: .// They did play it alot like d&d from what i hear
[20:39:33] James Van der Linde: /looc server is good but, the admins are basically a friend circle
[20:39:37] James Van der Linde: /looc no one else in
[20:39:53] James Van der Linde: /looc you can try to squirm your way into the group but it's really hard
[20:40:21] Lin'Garung: .// The only class we have are the colours for our eyes
[20:40:24] James Van der Linde: /looc like, you can feel the fact you're just a random that joined by chance whilst most of everyone else is close tied people
[20:40:54] Lin'Garung: .// Anyway...
[20:41:03] James Van der Linde: /looc you did succeed yes :)
[20:41:11] Lin'Garung: .// and it was no lie?
[20:41:20] James Van der Linde: /looc roll to beat was 60
[20:41:29] Lin'Garung: .// and it was no lie?
[20:42:36] James Van der Linde: /it James appeared to be saying the truth. He kinda seemed lost in thought and thinking about old times as he talked about his past before the war and the combine. For what the vortigaunts could discern, the man wasn't lying and had genuine good intentions.
[20:43:03] Lin'Garung: Hmm...
[20:43:35] Adir'En: We mean no disrespect to Van der Linde, we only wish to keep all safe from The Combine.
[20:44:08] Adir'En: For we share our own struggles and shackles.
[20:44:11] James Van der Linde: No, no. I understand completely, I'd also be weirded out if someone asked a question like the one I am.
[20:45:23] Lin'Garung: Yet once the Linde joins the ranks of the combine... It is as the cartier has stated.- The linde would only find use out of the radio frequency the combine now use...
[20:46:06] Lin'Garung: Such information could be found from any fallen member...
[20:46:53] James Van der Linde: Maybe if you're lucky but... I'm sure they change their frequencies regularly, specially after losing a member of theirs.
[20:47:13] James Van der Linde: They aren't dumb. It's how they own the entire planet now.
[20:47:20] Lin'Garung: Hmm... that is true indeed...
[20:47:48] Lin'Garung: Yet knowing it would be a great time to act...

[20:50:04] Adir'En: We must ponder on the many questions provided.
[20:50:18] Adir'En: A great deal of mysteries are upon us.
[20:50:25] James Van der Linde: Mhm. I can agree so. I'll probably ask Paul on more details on the whole thing if people in here are actually going to want me to go for it.

The small little toad lets out a few croaks before dozing off in the confines of his newfound home. A true sanctuary, or at least that's what Gregory believes, for he's merely a simple-minded frog, albeit one of an extraterrestrial species. Of course, the footlocker home isn't perfect, and it could use from some upgrades in the future, but alas; Gregory will obtain more in due time. He is a frog of commitment.

And the evening and the morning were the first day. 6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. 7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. 8 And God cal
