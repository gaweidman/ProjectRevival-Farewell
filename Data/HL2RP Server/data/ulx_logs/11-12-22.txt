[01:32:12] Samuel Rodriguez: /chardesc This man stands at about 5'9, and he stands tall. He walks with purpose; Like he has a goal in mind. His suit conceals all of his features, but underneath it he has long, dark hair tied into a ponytail and some light facial hair. His expressions show a fair amount of confidence and his eyebrows are furrowed. He seems distasteful of where is is, but will make the best of it. He wears a red and black winter coat, as well as a pair of light, fingerless gloves.

[17:42:56] Otto Von Habsburg: Besides that, all I have to say to you all is to be careful in the sewers, and especially the CZ. If you didn't notice, CPs like to overwatch over the area.
[17:43:06] Otto Von Habsburg: Getting caught in there is asking for a sewer raid.
[17:43:15] Lin'Garung: This one is unaware of this so called "CZ"

[17:47:56] Ava Carter: alright
[17:47:59] Otto Von Habsburg: That's probably the safer option.
[17:48:01] Jacob Desmone: Say cutter before you goto bed
[17:48:26] Jacob Desmone: If your ever bored recovering I can tell ya the frequency for a station I found that plays non UU music.
[17:48:28] Otto Von Habsburg: /me takes any materials still lying about that they used and places them in a seperate bag, for cleaning later.

The foul beast known as Gregory is pleased with the current events, and shall refrain from inciting his wrath upon this world, for they are not ready. Gregory must slumber, though he will return, for Gregory is a deific being of unimaginable power, or at least that's what he likes to believe. In reality, Gregory is no more than a teleporting chumtoad capable of bringing himeslf back from certain death, able to avoid the eternal slumber, for Gregory does not want to return to the void.
