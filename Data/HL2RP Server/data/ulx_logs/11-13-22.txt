[00:52:11] Ethan King: However, destroying the Warehouse will do equal amounts of damage, quite the big target.
[00:52:21] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I didn't want to rain on your guys' parade in your own house, but I'm definitely concerned about what that'll do to us and our cause.
[00:52:36] The raven named Charles: // i just watch math vids for fun sometimes
[00:52:39] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Shit, with that goofy bitch Ava, I'm having a hard enough time feeling safe behind a locked door
[00:52:43] Paul-Henri Cartier: you can do damage without doing physical damage
[00:52:55] Ethan King: Indeed, we'll be having to... chastise her soon enough .
[00:52:58] The raven named Charles: // im great at parties please trust me
[00:53:03] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I can only imagine how fucked the situation would be if we were to bomb a warehouse
[00:53:31] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I hope it's soon, because the situation is bad for people without a literal secret base.
[00:53:33] Ethan King: The Combine have started their civil unrest, the seeds of it at least, that public execution did it, we'll be the ones to make it grow.
[00:53:36] Paul-Henri Cartier: all we'd have to do is shout 'Advisor Advisor Advisor' on air and the city'll be gone.
[00:53:51] Ethan King: True, we could do that as a last resort.
[00:53:59] Ethan King: Or.... well you know the other one we could do, Paul.
[00:54:05] Paul-Henri Cartier: let's not
[00:54:16] Ethan King: /me looked over to him knowingly, nodding lightly. - "Real last resort business?"
[00:54:19] Paul-Henri Cartier: mhm
[00:54:23] Ethan King: Right
[00:54:49] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: What's Advisor, a code word or something?
[00:54:58] Paul-Henri Cartier: something like that
[00:55:02] Ethan King: Yeah, we'll go with that.
[00:55:03] The raven named Charles<STEAM_0:0:34463192> changed their name to Morb
[00:55:12] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: /me feels the ex-GRID unit staring daggers into him as soon as the words leave his mouth.

[00:55:42] Ethan King: But yes! this will no doubt cause issues, of course the Combine will start swarming, did you think trying to start an actual uprising wouldn't do such a thing?
[00:56:10] Paul-Henri Cartier to admins: do you remember the cave johnson autonomous sendoff thing
[00:56:27] Paul-Henri Cartier to admins: was that wiped from server canon, or can i reference that

[00:56:55] Paul-Henri Cartier to admins: high command
[00:57:01] Paul-Henri Cartier to admins: but paul was THROUGH one
[00:57:07] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris to admins: everoyne lower in rank thinks it's just clearing out the city and then relocating people
[00:57:09] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris to admins: to other cities
[00:57:32] Paul-Henri Cartier to admins: nah, but a shit tonne of people actually experienced it where ota was killing units
[00:57:51] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I mean, true, but I feel like we won't get to the actual revolution if we make ourselves targets too early.
[00:57:56] Paul-Henri Cartier: where're our circuit boards and stuff?
[00:58:03] Ethan King: Near the kitchen I believe 
[00:58:09] Another Zombie<STEAM_0:0:34463192> changed their name to Froge
[00:58:16] Paul-Henri Cartier: man, we never decided what we'll say once we do it
[00:58:20] Ethan King: Hm... feel free to speak your mind if you've a better idea.
[00:58:27] Ethan King: True actually.
[00:58:27] Paul-Henri Cartier: Like, some sort of 'Poland is not yet lost' thing?
[00:58:30] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: hm
[00:58:35] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: no one around
[00:58:38] Paul-Henri Cartier: Or a 'It's time to cut the tall trees' thing?
[00:58:38] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: just us
[00:58:42] Ethan King: We could do something like that.
[00:58:43] Froge: ribbit 1
[00:58:45] Ethan King: Hm....
[00:58:47] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: I agree
[00:59:06] Ethan King: Right, but our friend makes a good point, making ourselves too big a target too quickly might cause more issues than previously thought.
[00:59:36] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I'm not trying to shit on you. I respect you guys, of course. You've got an amazing setup.
[00:59:43] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: 63

[01:02:03] Ethan King: Speaking of, Paul, is that Mitchel friend of yours in any way going to rebel? Or is he too far gone by now?

[01:03:37] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I really don't want to take from you like that. Like, I appreciate support, but that feels different for a reason I'm having a hard time understanding.
[01:04:09] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Please take care of your people. Your goals definitely aren't the same as ours. Of course, revolution, but other than that.
[01:04:10] Ethan King: /me nodded lightly. - "Right, well feel free to ask for something from me, I don't mind doing a favor if it means we're in good relations!"

[01:23:34] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: /me opens it and pulls out a CWU ID card. He holds it out for the officer to take with two fingers, his index and middle.
[01:24:12] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: /me would shift to hold his SMG with his right hand, grabbing the ID card with his left, checking it over. The blue glow of his lenses shimmer onto its surface a bit, before he hands it back, presuming it's valid.
[01:24:23] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: alright, looks to be in order

[01:25:57] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: /me would look it over, then nodding once seeing it's validity. He took a look at both of them.

[01:42:10] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: /me would hold out the general purpose toolkit and the hexguy.
[01:42:13] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: these what you need?
[01:42:30] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Yep, perfect. Am I good to take them here, or should I wait until we get into the room?

[01:42:42] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: But, I do have an unrelated question

[01:44:11] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: I was in the Grotto when you two showed up
[01:44:28] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: Heard a door, probably the bathroom door, open up when I was inside
[01:44:37] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: I didn't see you two in there when I came in, though
[01:44:44] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: Where were you?
[01:45:23] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: We were talking out front. We were trying to find a unit, we figured we would find one in that part of town.
[01:45:40] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: hm
[01:45:58] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: Hadn't seen anyone about for a while. I did hear someone in the grotto talking about heads in jars, though
[01:46:03] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: what was that about?
[01:46:31] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Oh, I was telling my buddy here about the cremators. I've seen them in jars working in the Waste Processing building
[01:46:43] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: right
[01:46:52] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: let's go
[01:46:54] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I'm sure you're aware, but apparently they keep them in jars when they're off duty, or something. I didn't ask
[01:47:08] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: /me would hit the big shiny red button.
[01:47:52] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: just to let you both know,
[01:48:02] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: as per protocol, I'm going to have to search you before you enter
[01:48:05] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: can't let anything slide by
[01:48:10] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I figured, makes sense.
[01:48:13] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: right
[01:48:18] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: both of you, step onto the wall please
[01:48:50] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: /me faces the wall and puts his arms up to be searched more easily.
[01:49:02] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: /me would pull out a simple pair of plastic zip-ties, slipping them around the wrists of the first man.
[01:49:22] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: /me would step back, reaching into his pouch, and doing the same for the other.
[01:49:29] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: /it Given he didn't resist, of course.
[01:49:55] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: /me would pat down the first man, searching anything that could hide an object or four.
[01:49:58] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: /charsearch
[01:50:39] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: what's this note about?
[01:50:47] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: /me would grab the note, reading it.
[01:51:31] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I was taking notes of what's in the waste processing that I might need to and be able to work on or repair or any of those

[01:53:51] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: /me would move to the next man, patting him down and searching him.

[01:56:08] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: /me would take out his standard issue combat knife, and cuts the plastic ties from their wrists.

[02:00:13] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: yeah
[02:00:44] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: /me would walk to the console, glancing to the left and right of him at the men. He had a bad feeling, but nothing to really do about it. So, he unlocked the terminal, stepping back.
[02:00:49] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: there
[02:00:55] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Thanks
[02:01:00] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: step back

[02:14:32] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: OR, better yet, I can show you which lines to disconnect
[02:14:54] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: I'd rather you do it, I don't want to get rank points deducted

[02:16:58] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: Does the CWU not permit hands-on training?
[02:17:38] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: .me uses the hex key to oen the access to the insides of the machine.
[02:17:45] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Can you lease use your biosginalto undo this latch
[02:18:03] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Just hold wrist u to... this here
[02:18:21] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: /me would hover his wrist over the biosignal reader.
[02:19:09] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: .it A sound comes from the machine and its face would noticeably be unlocked.
[02:19:55] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: .me ulls the face u and disconnects the main owercord
[02:20:18] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: .it The machine turns off
[02:20:27] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Lets see...
[02:20:34] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Microhone..
[02:20:42] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Good shae...
[02:20:55] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Cord is fine
[02:21:45] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: .me goes back to the jacks on the wall
[02:21:59] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: AUDIO IN, AUDIO OUT
[02:22:20] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: What is...
[02:22:36] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: .me uses his hands to motion toward the button
[02:22:50] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: What is this button. Do you know,
[02:23:05] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: The main one?
[02:23:10] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: .icly there is no label
[02:23:18] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: THat one, ye
[02:23:37] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: It calls for a work shift for the residents of this sector
[02:23:43] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: Connects to the main city PA
[02:23:46] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I see
[02:24:00] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: So that means,,
[02:24:32] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: .me looks where the micrhone cord is connected to and finds a switch
[02:24:54] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: So the setting  canc hange, but you dont need it to,b ecause this is what it does mostly
[02:25:07] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: That makes sense considering how little ower its been using
[02:25:54] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: So it takes... a continuous feed, but nothing comes from the seakers until you authorize the message over the interface
[02:26:50] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: So we might able to test it out with a music radio, if we need to fix it
[02:27:05] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: But it seems to be fine
[02:27:49] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: ,me closes the interfaces front cover, which automatically makes the biolock close
[02:27:57] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I think thats all
[02:28:26] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I am ready to get out and be aid when you are
[02:28:39] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: /looc be aid?
[02:28:51] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: .be given ayment for my work
[02:29:04] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: sure
[02:29:20] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: okay
[02:29:21] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: uh
[02:29:25] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: dont look at this
[02:29:34] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: .me reoves the set of tools from his chest stras
[02:29:48] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: ,me also holds the hex key searately
[02:30:06] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: /me would grab the toolset and the hexkey, setting it down to the side.
[02:30:30] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: CWU should handle your payment. I can let them know. I wasn't warned beforehand, so I don't have it on me
[02:30:57] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: No roblem. Thank you, I areciate you taking the time for me
[02:31:02] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: mhm
[02:31:19] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: get going, it's late. They'll want you in for the night real soon
[02:31:21] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: ,me holds the set of tools and hex key in his hand for the officer to take
[02:31:34] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: /me would take the tools, setting the hexkey in the bag.
[02:31:36] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: This is true. Thank you again.
[02:31:42] CCA.C17-UNION.i3.29852: /me would nod.
[02:31:47] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Have a good one. Glory
[02:32:37] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: This suit is getting uncomfortable. Do you mind if I sto by a bathroom before we head home

[02:38:44] Aurelio Grau: Nice. Lookin' fresh.
[02:38:57] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Thanks, I think its a good look
[02:40:11] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: huh
[02:40:21] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: that is recent
[02:40:24] Aurelio Grau: Yeah
[02:42:20] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: So
[02:42:26] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: That was successful
[02:42:28] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I learned a bit
[02:42:30] Aurelio Grau: Yeah?
[02:42:39] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Yeah, I think theyll want to know what I learned
[02:42:59] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: So, we needto move. Thats not something that were arguing over. I agree
[02:43:05] Aurelio Grau: Yup.
[02:43:22] Aurelio Grau: We gotta' avoid the surface I think
[02:43:42] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: We have some friends
[02:44:15] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I think as long as were loyal to them, we might able to live there, until we can find our own
[02:44:23] Aurelio Grau: Sure thing.
[02:44:30] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Sound like a good lan
[02:44:51] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Were not an authoritarian organization, so tell me if that does not sound good
[02:45:05] Aurelio Grau: Well, I think it's a good plan.
[02:45:16] Aurelio Grau: So yeah, let's do it.
[02:46:09] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Awesome
[02:46:15] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: So, my idea, outside of that
[02:46:42] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I think it is only natural for us to hae the best awy to kee imortant information safe
[02:46:51] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: We need a comuter
[02:47:05] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: One that we can add to as our oeration grows.
[02:47:11] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: That could be art one
[02:47:18] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Just using it as a library
[02:47:22] Aurelio Grau: Yeah, sure.
[02:47:32] Aurelio Grau: Sounds pretty possible.
[02:47:52] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Right, feasible
[02:48:08] Aurelio Grau: See a ton of computer parts laying around down under.
[02:48:18] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Exactly.
[02:48:33] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: After that, where we are
[02:48:36] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: could atter
[02:49:02] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: We could either try to go after more hard to find information, seek out classifeid information
[02:49:20] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Or we could try to distribute ncessary information between others
[02:49:46] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: If we have our own comuter, we could use it as a way of distribution to others.
[02:50:43] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Have our own smaller server, and hve others log in and be given cocktail recies or tis on maintaing your lumbing
[02:50:49] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: If you catch my draft
[02:50:55] Aurelio Grau: Yeah I get that.
[02:51:13] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: In all honesty, Im not sure if distributon is always th ebes choice
[02:51:19] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I feel like it could be
[02:51:51] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: But look what haens when you say too much. That lace has so many eole living there
[02:52:00] Aurelio Grau: Yup.
[02:52:19] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: All it takes is one erson to say something, and everything is gone
[02:52:27] Aurelio Grau: Yeah, exactly.
[02:53:24] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Is it our duty to reserve the infrmation, but not give it to eole unless we know theyre deserving or they ahve trust
[02:53:57] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Maybe, I dont know. Maybe. What do you think
[02:54:12] Aurelio Grau: I think it'd be a good idea to stay reserved. Less risky.
[02:54:25] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: So its not just me
[02:54:32] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I think that makes the most sense
[02:54:35] Aurelio Grau: Yup
[02:54:52] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Huh. So we should restructure the reservationists.
[02:55:17] Aurelio Grau: And I assume you have an idea on how we'd do that specifically?
[02:55:30] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Not at the moment, but I can when I think
[02:55:37] Aurelio Grau: Ah, alright.
[02:55:54] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Robably by being more standoffish
[02:56:18] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Not telling others what we have behind our doors or the full extent we have infroamton
[02:56:39] Aurelio Grau: Yeah. No one other person shall know everything we have.
[02:56:51] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Right
[02:57:23] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I think that would still be  a success
[02:57:40] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: The ifnroamtion exists. It maay not be there on demand, but thats how we kee it safe
[02:57:56] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: We save the ifnroation
[02:58:02] Aurelio Grau: Yeah.
[02:58:10] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I think were onto something.
[02:58:23] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Im getting tired. All of that took my energy.
[02:58:35] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: I am robaaly going to go to bed
[02:58:35] Aurelio Grau: Yeah, me too.
[02:58:55] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Thanks for staying forthat. 
[02:59:10] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Great lies, really quick on making them u
[02:59:15] Aurelio Grau: Yeah, of course, man. Thanks
[02:59:21] Aurelio Grau: One more thing.
[02:59:38] Aurelio Grau: If you find wire rope, would you be kind enough to give them to me?
[02:59:56] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: Got it. Ill look for it
[03:00:02] Ephraim 'Loew' Harris: /pm echo DRINK

[10:24:39] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.04796: Heard.
[10:24:42] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.94233: Search people often.
[10:24:51] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.04796: You think we can install turrets on the upper catwalks?
[10:25:00] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.94233: The catwalks?
[10:25:15] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.04796: Yeah. It would prevent anti-citizens from getting up their

[10:25:30] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.04796: hm

[10:26:19] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.04796: suppose thats a command decision... might have to make that a suggestion to the Ofc or someone higher
[10:26:30] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.94233: Probably.

[10:26:38] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.94233: I already released viscerators

[10:26:54] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.94233: OTA tagged 3 DBS

[10:27:37] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.94233: Nope

[10:27:46] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.94233: Just 3 DBs were found in the same area
[10:27:51] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.04796: Huh
[10:28:05] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.94233: We know the viscerators got them because well

[10:28:07] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.94233: Haha
[10:28:33] CCA.C17-UNION.i4.04796: yeah. Maybe get them to stay in one spot. See which ones get destroyed first and we can pin point where they operate at
[10:28:38] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.94233: Probably
[10:28:45] CCA.C17-GRID.i3.94233: OTA would of found them already if they were in a obvious area

[23:00:44] Ethan King: For sure... I wasn't exactly doing much on that day to be quite honest, I was scouting the Wastelands to the West of the city gates.
[23:00:56] Ethan King: /looc was on i2 that day ;-;
[23:01:02] Lin'Garung: .// HMmm
[23:01:21] Lin'Garung: Why would it be...
[23:01:31] Lin'Garung: And why the hudson more then the others...

[23:02:18] Ethan King: Hmph... these things seem to be random to be quite honest, most of the time it's just random from my knowledge.
[23:02:25] Lin'Garung: .// santa claus is not real *everything dies*
[23:02:32] Douglas Hudson: .// lmao
[23:02:34] Ethan King: Douglas, have you done anything extraordinary before these events?
[23:02:50] Douglas Hudson: Can't say I've er'... Hmm yes
[23:02:52] Douglas Hudson: I have
[23:02:57] Douglas Hudson: But I'm not the one wielding the gun
[23:02:58] Ethan King: That would be?
[23:03:03] DRD<STEAM_0:0:193599766> changed their name to Paul-Henri Cartier
[23:03:10] Douglas Hudson: I'm just *taken* there, observing.
[23:03:20] Douglas Hudson: Not to the extent that you've seen though
[23:03:31] Douglas Hudson<STEAM_0:0:52468151> used the tool camera on maps/rp_industrial17_v1.bsp
[23:03:48] Ethan King: Hm.... mind elaborating? I assume you mean Xen.
[23:04:21] Douglas Hudson: Yeah. I mean- If you've been in this city long enough y'know about the occasional explosion n' psionic bullcrap that happends here n' there.
[23:04:33] Ethan King: Right.
[23:04:51] Douglas Hudson: I'm not the one particularly *interacting*  with said creatures n' the like, but I'm more or less observing.
[23:05:10] Douglas Hudson: A neutral party if you'd like.... Least that's what I wanna be represented as.
[23:05:50] Ethan King: /me snapped his fingers. - "Bingo, think it's because we're of the few in this city to do such things? Enter Xen unscathed and come back, the sort."
[23:06:06] Ethan King: You don't just cross dimensions on a whim, this was planned.
[23:06:15] Ethan King: There is a lot of big powers out there routing for and against us, I'm sure of it.
[23:06:28] Douglas Hudson: Likely so.
[23:06:29] Lin'Garung: That is an odd way of thinking...
[23:06:46] Douglas Hudson: What we should get behind is the motives of these creatures.
[23:06:59] Ethan King: That's the part I never get down.
[23:07:14] Douglas Hudson: It's a matter of communication I think.
[23:07:26] Ethan King: Even the ones I've.... *worked* for I haven't ever gotten their motives down.
[23:07:42] Douglas Hudson: I mean... we did somethin' right when it came to these ol' Vorts.
[23:07:54] Lin'Garung: Hmm...
[23:07:59] Ethan King: For sure, having Vortigaunts around makes this wacky cosmic shit way easier.
[23:08:22] Douglas Hudson: Guess that's the advantage we got now.
[23:08:32] Ethan King: Even better if we had an Elder Vortigaunt.
[23:08:42] Ethan King: Though, I'll take what I can get.
[23:08:49] Lin'Garung: May this one change the subject towards the combine?
[23:08:53] Ethan King: Sure
[23:08:58] Lin'Garung: We know they must have known of this crystal...
[23:09:00] Douglas Hudson: Elders huh? I've heard lil stories 'bout those kinda fellers.
[23:09:19] Douglas Hudson: Sorry yeah- subject change... right
[23:09:27] Paul-Henri Cartier: I wonder how vorts would like the hit series Stargate SG1
[23:09:29] Ethan King: I'm certain they know of the crystal, most Xen Crystals aren't ever really forgotten, though I doubt they know of it's purposes.
[23:09:38] Ethan King: They'd like it for sure Paul!
[23:10:01] Douglas Hudson: Wasn't this thing- er'... not similar to xen though?
[23:10:13] Douglas Hudson: Remember you brushin' up on that or somethin, Lin. From the first time
[23:10:34] Lin'Garung: Hmm... It is true in some aspects...
[23:10:44] Douglas Hudson: Perhaps a third party.
[23:10:52] Ethan King: Possible
[23:11:09] Douglas Hudson: What are the odds we can get good relations with em'?
[23:11:11] Lin'Garung: It is *not* xen, and yet holds similarity in its origin
[23:11:17] Ethan King: /looc gotta update my PAC soon
[23:11:24] Douglas Hudson: .// how come?
[23:11:28] Ethan King: Good relations? No clue, maybe?>
[23:11:29] Douglas Hudson: .// it's got the big floof winter boi
[23:11:32] Ethan King: /looc  I wanna 
[23:11:36] Lin'Garung: relations with the crystal?
[23:11:50] Ethan King: Probably talking about whatever's behind the crystal.
[23:11:51] Douglas Hudson: Well that's my goal- er'... not exactly, but of this probably *third*  entity...
[23:12:05] Douglas Hudson: .// probable*
[23:12:21] Lin'Garung: Hmm this one suggests it would be up to the three here...
[23:12:32] Lin'Garung: two here...
[23:12:49] Douglas Hudson: If we get good relations, we got nothin' to loose.
[23:13:05] Douglas Hudson: Better to make friends then enemies.
[23:13:14] Ethan King: I have a..... less than good track record with cosmic entites and good relations.
[23:13:21] Douglas Hudson: Who's to say it'd be willin' though.
[23:13:25] Lin'Garung: Why is that?
[23:13:41] Ethan King: Well, put it this way, the only entity I've made good terms with is that *Reaper*.
[23:13:51] Ethan King: And I'm frightful of even saying his name with my closest comrades.

[23:14:23] Lin'Garung: Hmm this one could hardly see it as *good*  terms...
[23:14:26] Douglas Hudson: Least' you've got a track record of havin' a somewhat.... *somewhat*  good resault.
[23:14:52] Ethan King: Well, point is Lin,  it's difficult and dangerous to try and work with these entities.
[23:15:13] Ethan King: We could try if you two want, but I have experience enough to be justified in saying it's a dicey subject.
[23:15:34] Douglas Hudson: Went this far, we might as well go all the way.
[23:16:00] Lin'Garung: Tis' our battle we fight is it not?
[23:16:11] Douglas Hudson: That it is.

[23:16:32] Ethan King: Fair enough... if we do it, we aren't half assing it, we'll be diverting our attention from that Warehouse to ensuring this mystery is solved.
[23:16:44] Ethan King: Anyways, that Operation is doomed at this point due to Ava.
[23:16:50] Lin'Garung: How so?
[23:16:55] Douglas Hudson: Fucked up the security, huh?
[23:16:59] Lin'Garung: What was this "operation"?
[23:17:12] Douglas Hudson: The whole warehouse thing, remember?
[23:17:14] Samuel Rodriguez suicided!
[23:17:20] Lin'Garung: This one does n-
[23:17:21] Ethan King: To blow up Warehouse 3 and send a message, it was reliant on the fact that the Combine weren't really readied for Rebel attachs.
[23:17:24] Ethan King: /looc attacks*
[23:17:24] Lin'Garung: Ahh...

[23:18:54] Ethan King: Yeah, even our scouting is becoming difficult at this point, too dangerous to be in the city.

[23:19:52] Douglas Hudson: Fixed the bloody nose but that was' 'bout it.
[23:20:01] Lin'Garung: This one is able... and shall in a moment...

[23:20:52] Lin'Garung: Yet this is all that Lin is able to recall from the crystal as of now... Should the King ever have any questions... should direct himself to *Our* kin
[23:21:07] Douglas Hudson: We also need to er'.... ponder it a bit more
[23:21:07] Lin'Garung: As should the Hudson...
[23:21:15] Douglas Hudson: This information is fresh we havn't connected the dots just yet.
[23:21:24] Lin'Garung: Our perspectives may vary...
[23:21:27] Alex Palovichov to admins: About the requirements for the sweeps...Is there any?
[23:21:32] Lin'Garung: so it is important to hear all...
[23:21:37] Ethan King: Right...
[23:21:45] Paul-Henri Cartier to admins: usually, whenever we have proof there's bad people in the sewers
[23:22:15] Ethan King: Well good to hear all this Lin, both you and Douglas are doing wonders, keep my updated. I'll be doing an announcement soon on our new objective, to learn of this crystal and what entities are watching over us, a double edged sword this situation is.
[23:22:25] Lin'Garung: // Discord vort text channel when?
