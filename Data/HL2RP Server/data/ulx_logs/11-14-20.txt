[01:27:38] Dustin Rory: Hmph.....as far as I know...one -
[01:27:39] CCA.C14-JUDGE.i4.22767: /toggleraise
[01:27:41] Dustin Rory: Sorry
[01:29:03] Dustin Rory: One possibly large base is in the Canals...I would suggest bringing a unit prepared for such conditions to go check it out...possibly with me so we can make it easier to find it and confirm with a unit.
[01:29:19] Dustin Rory: But....it's a large brick wall....relatively easy to see that it's a door.
[01:29:27] Dustin Rory: Literally indented into the wall.
[01:29:28] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: You going with a unit gives the possibility of your death, which we do not need
[01:30:09] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: But units will check it out
[01:30:11] Dustin Rory: You can access the brick wall by going down a rope....all the way down might I add.
[01:30:20] Dustin Rory: Another is on top of the rooftops.
[01:30:23] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: Understood.
[01:30:27] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: That one is known.
[01:30:30] Dustin Rory: Good
[01:30:39] Dustin Rory: At the moment. Those are the most well hidden
[01:30:45] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: Copy
[01:30:58] Dustin Rory: My surveying of the area leads me to believe you know about the other less hidden areas.
[01:31:01] CAC.C14-CRM.50539: // i can lock doors
[01:31:12] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: Forces will be briefed, and a small scouting party will be sent to find the canals base.
[01:31:17] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: Is that all for bases?
[01:31:22] Dustin Rory: Hmm......at the moment....yes.
[01:31:25] Dustin Rory: One more thing
[01:31:43] Dustin Rory: That brick wall base is most likely owned by a large rebel group
[01:31:57] Dustin Rory: Atleast...from the fact that they have such a well hidden wall.
[01:32:05] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: noted
[01:32:10] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: scouts will be cautious
