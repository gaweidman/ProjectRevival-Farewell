[21:55:50] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: Yes?
[21:55:58] UU-SeC.17: You have been serving since Industrial 17, correct?
[21:56:20] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: Affirmative.
[21:56:34] UU-SeC.17: Good. Have you considered having higher command?
[21:56:51] UU-SeC.17: //hey quick say bloxwich in IC caht

[21:57:27] Klaudiusz Olszewski: // what
[21:58:26] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: Considered? Yes, I have always considered the possibility of having higher command, yes. However me receiving higher command is not up to me, of course.
[21:58:39] CCA.C17-QrM.98240: // Alrighty, gonna get off for now.
[21:58:48] Dropped "CCA.C17-QrM.98240" from server<STEAM_0:1:17219621>

[21:59:33] UU-SeC.17: Describe your method to me.
[21:59:38] UU-SeC.17: And your principles.
[22:01:56] UU-SeC.17 set the scale for Themself to 1
[22:01:56] UU-SeC.17: !scale ^ 1.18
[22:02:02] UU-SeC.17: /toggleraise
[22:02:47] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: My method for leading is by example. I have always learned that leading by example dominates. Showing my units exactly how to perform their tasks, when to do it, and perfecting that task is how I achieve success. The units subordinate to me study how I wo-
[22:02:51] UU-SeC.17: /toggleraise
[22:03:48] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: How I work and they learn off it, better perfecting their methods of extracting information from subjects.
[22:06:16] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: Principles...Fear. I've learned that the principle of fear keeps those who would otherwise oppose us in line. Loud voices, frightening postures, tempers that appear shorter than they are. Principles of respect. Respect is earned, not given out like-
[22:06:24] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: UU-approved chocolate
[22:07:37] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: Respect is something that *should* keep units from running their mouthes to higher ranked units. Should they decide that respect doesn't matter, well... the principle of Fear comes in. Finally, the prnciple of Pain. If they can't learn normally, beat it in
[22:08:18] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: to their skulls so they can't forget it. Pain gets the information we need out of insurrectionist. Pain is what we specialize in. Which is why we are so effective.
[22:08:27] UU-SeC.17: Wonderful.
[22:08:32] UU-SeC.17: /viewobjectives
[22:08:59] UU-SeC.17: And why, while knowing all of that eloquent way of ruling...
[22:09:36] UU-SeC.17: /y DO YOU NOT KNOW TO NOT GIVE CITIZENS WEAPONS?
[22:09:50] UU-SeC.17 set the scale for Themself to 1
[22:10:42] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: Talking about Rory? He used it to paralyze Bail from the waist down. That's how I was able to get all the information from him. How the OTA sewer raid was so successful, and how we eliminated another Watcher.
[22:10:54] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: Insight is helpful.
[22:11:30] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: Either way, he was getting close to Bail, and he needed *something* to defend himself if the idiot Bail decided to attack without thinking.
[22:14:34] UU-SeC.17: /y YOU BROKE THE SIMPLEST RULE YOU HAD TO FOLLOW! WE DON'T NEED TO FLAGRANTLY BREAK PROTOCOL TO DO SOMETHING WE WERE ALREADY GOING TO DO AND WERE CAPABLE OF DOING! 
[22:15:04] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: If we were capable, then why wasn't he caught sooner?
[22:15:35] UU-SeC.17: /y IF WE WERE CAPABLE, WHY DIDN'T WE CATCH JIMMY JOHN SOONER? DO NOT DEFEND YOUR STANCE HERE, JUDGE.
[22:15:45] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: okay
[22:16:35] UU-SeC.17: /Y THESE THINGS TAKE TIME, BUT HE CAN'T OUTRUN A DAMNED GLOBAL FORCE FOREVER! WE WON'T GET PUNKED BY A SINGLE MAN!
[22:16:53] UU-SeC.17: /Y WE DON'T NEED YOUR POOR JUDGMENT TO DRAG US DOWN!

[22:17:11] UU-SeC.17 set the scale for Themself to 2
[22:17:30] UU-SeC.17 set the scale for Themself to 1
[22:17:57] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: Drag us down? It led to the capture of two Watchers, and the decimation of an entire rebel network operating below City 14.
[22:19:30] UU-SeC.17: /y WE COULD HAVE FOUND IT OTHERWISE. IT IS RULE NUMBER *ONE*! DO NOT GIVE WEAPONS TO CITIZENS! WE ARE AN INTERGALACTIC EMPIRE THAT HAS BEEN SUBJUGATING WORLDS FOR TIME LONGER THAN YOU CAN *IMAGINE*. WE CAN HANDLE A SINGLE MAN.
[22:19:39] UU-SeC.17: .//it's funny because this is literally the plot of gordon freeman
[22:20:27] UU-SeC.17: /y WE CAN HANDLE A COUPLE OF ROWDY HUMANS.
[22:20:32] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: I know
[22:20:49] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: But surely hastening the process a bit doesn't hurt?
[22:21:01] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: Again, two watchers killed and an entire network decimated.
[22:21:49] UU-SeC.17: /y IT STARTS WITH ONE PROTOCOL BREACH. THEN IT BECOMES NORMAL IF WE ACCEPT IT. IT KEEPS HAPPENING UNTIL WE HAVE EpUs GIVING GUNS TO UNBRAINWASHED SOLDIERS!

[22:23:20] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: Sir, his knife was going to be taken within this week anyways. He has no need of it anymore. The situation is over, I really don't see any use in arguing over an already finished situation that benefitted only us. He hasn't shown it to anyone else,
[22:23:29] CCA.C14-JUDGE.OfC.91412: and he's a loyalist who keeps to himself.
[22:24:56] UU-SeC.17: /y THERE IS NO EXCUSE. WE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THEM EVENTUALLY. LOW RANKING UNITS ARE EXPENDABLE. IF THEY KILL A FEW OF THOSE, OH SHUCKS.
[22:25:02] UU-SeC.17: /Y IT DOESN'T MATTER.
[22:25:08] UU-SeC.17: /Y IT DOESN'T MATTER TAKING THAT KIND OF RISK.
[22:25:26] UU-SeC.17: You will be receiving one blackmark, and will stay as an officer.
