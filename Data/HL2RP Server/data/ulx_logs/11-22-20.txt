[19:00:52] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: This is my job
[19:01:56] CAC.C17-BIOTIC.45914: /it You see that the bindings are made from a light Combine metal alloy. It is unclear if it is fitted with a bomb, but on the outside appearance, it doesn't look like it.
[19:02:05] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: Hmph....
[19:02:13] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: Good news
[19:02:14] Achille 'Tucker' Tristram: How good is the metal?
[19:02:25] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: He isn't going to explode the moment we try anything on him.
[19:02:32] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: Atleast....from what I can tell.
[19:02:41] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: The metal itself isn't much.
[19:02:42] Achille 'Tucker' Tristram: Thats a odd chance but okay
[19:02:53] Achille 'Tucker' Tristram: We could do it rightnow
[19:02:57] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: Just some light version of that Combine metal bullshit.
[19:03:10] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: Have fun doing that in this situation without any real good tools.
[19:03:17] Achille 'Tucker' Tristram: We have a blow torch
[19:03:19] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: be my guest, i'm not doing it though.
[19:03:23] Achille 'Tucker' Tristram: or we could use that acid
[19:03:26] Achille 'Tucker' Tristram: from the car engine
[19:03:30] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: An industrial torch that will burn his skin instantly.
[19:03:35] Achille 'Tucker' Tristram: I guess ya
[19:03:37] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: The Acid will corrode his skin.
[19:03:38] Achille 'Tucker' Tristram: Hm
[19:03:47] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: We need something large and sharp.
[19:03:49] Achille 'Tucker' Tristram: How do we get it off then?
[19:03:51] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: Maybe a bolt cutter.
[19:03:54] Janet 'Carolina' Fraiser: that gun?
[19:03:56] Achille 'Tucker' Tristram: I have plyers?
[19:03:58] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: Fuck that
[19:04:01] Janet 'Carolina' Fraiser: maybe if we angle it right it will blow it off
[19:04:13] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: That would be a massive waste of ammunition.
[19:04:23] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: .// Most ammuniton can go through simple metal.
[19:04:24] Achille 'Tucker' Tristram: Yes but think of how much he can do for us
[19:04:33] Achille 'Tucker' Tristram: This would be a good use
[19:04:41] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: Go find some bolt cutters and make this easy, or use ammunition.
[19:04:50] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: The first one I will help, the second one I won't.
[19:04:52] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: Do whatever
[19:04:52] Achille 'Tucker' Tristram: We have plyers
[19:04:59] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: Plyers aren't gonna do shit
[19:05:10] Achille 'Tucker' Tristram: Yeah but were would we get wire cutters
[19:05:12] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: A bolt cutter or some form of saw that can cut through metal.
[19:05:19] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: BOLT
[19:05:20] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: Not wire
[19:05:21] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: BOLT
[19:05:30] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: I don't know, look around in the Industrial area.
[19:05:33] Achille 'Tucker' Tristram: Okay
[19:05:37] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: I can do it tomorrow.
[19:05:44] Achille 'Tucker' Tristram: Here

[19:06:34] Achille 'Tucker' Tristram: You will be free soon we promise
[19:06:42] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: Probably soon
[19:06:46] CAC.C17-BIOTIC.45914: I can do this. I have been doing it since my imprisonment.
[19:06:54] Theban 'Simmons' Revolt: Hmph...good to know
[19:07:15] CAC.C17-BIOTIC.45914: My connection to the Vortessence will be low upon my release from these bindings... but with a teacher, I can reconnect myself and grow stronger.
[19:07:26] CAC.C17-BIOTIC.45914: I can also cook the beings you call "Headcrabs."

[19:09:19] Achille 'Tucker' Tristram: /me leans against the pole
[19:09:23] CAC.C17-BIOTIC.45914: Perhaps you could disable the function within my bindings that sever me from the Vortessence. That way, to the Combine I appear as a normal slave.
