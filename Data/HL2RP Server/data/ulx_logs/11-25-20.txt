[15:47:09] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: I understand if I have to be tied, but at least tie my hands infront of me.
[15:47:14] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: I can't do anything anyways.
[15:47:17] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: .// do you need me to stand up
[15:47:25] Morgan Beck: So, those... wanted posters. I know that they aren't on you anymore, but it had me thinking. A lot of the recent... activity hadn't started until you arrived, or at least when I met you.

[15:51:07] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.91412: /me removes his mask, revealing a somewhat pale, human face with augments. His eyes aren't real, they are artificial. They have a dull red glow to them. Scars are all over his face. Some cuts, some burns. There are also some studs in his head with wires.

[15:52:31] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.91412: The Airexchange.
[15:52:34] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: Right, right.
[15:52:45] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: Yeah, that was the Watchers'. I don't know why we did it, but we did.
[15:52:49] Morgan Beck: /w That... hm. Maybe I can finally get these... connections I've been trying to so desperately make.
[15:52:59] CCA.C17-UNION.SqL.72633: You exploded such a thing for no reason?
[15:53:04] Morgan Beck: /w A real foward for my... buisness. At least in terms of money making.

[15:53:20] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: I, was never informed, I was just goin' with them. I was told it was our last chance for freedom.
[15:53:31] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.91412: Then you were tricked into terrorism.
[15:53:42] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.91412: That factory was meant to improve the quality of life for all
[15:53:47] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: How so?
[15:53:57] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: looked like a lot of pollution was comin' outta' that place.
[15:54:31] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.91412: It would have replaced the polluted air with cleaner air. Pollution happens when a factory operates.
[15:54:46] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: Ahh... Well, anyways, after that.

[15:55:58] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: That whole thing was a blurr.. What happened, anyways?
[15:56:30] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.91412: A bunch of xenian creatures invaded via portal storms.
[15:56:37] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: Ahh, I see.

[15:57:38] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: He waved his hands around it, then next thing ya'know, he's talking to everyone in the whole city.
[15:57:52] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: Talkin' 'bout all this mumbo'jumbo.
[15:57:56] CCA.C17-UNION.SqL.72633: Any notable people during city 014?
[15:58:21] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: Uhh, not that I can remember..
[15:58:33] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.91412: That was the one that got killed by a lowly OWS and a Grunt.
[15:58:42] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.91412: So much for being big shit.
[15:58:51] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: The alien guy? He got killed?
[15:58:55] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.91412: Yeah
[15:58:55] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.91412: haha
[15:59:03] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: So much for bein' a prophet.
[15:59:04] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.91412: Idiot broke his staff thing
[15:59:34] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: But, now here we are. I've run out of people to go to, and I left everyone behind. And now I'm in this cell.
[15:59:37] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.91412: The two that killed it got promoted and formed Killteam Alpha. Our most dangerous OTA attack force aside from the elites.
[15:59:46] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.91412: well
[15:59:52] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.91412: that was a fun trip.

[16:00:04] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: Right.. A painful, annoying, fun trip.
[16:00:17] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: I remember gettin' bit by one of 'em poison headcrabs.

[16:01:15] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.91412: One thing
[16:01:23] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.91412: I want to know why you chose the wrong side
[16:01:54] Father Doc<STEAM_0:1:55356759> changed their name to Chris 'Doc' Reed
[16:02:17] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: Had no purpose, I thought we would rise to the top and be the ones to restore society to what it once was, restore the army, make jobs, make people happy again.
[16:02:42] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.91412: You can't beat the Universal Union. You should know that by now.

[16:03:30] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: Ever.
[16:03:51] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: Ah, who am I kidding.
[16:03:52] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.91412: I know how most of these cells operate. They all want peace and to restore. But to do that, they have to take out the Universal Union. And they can't do that
[16:04:14] Client "Father Doc" spawned in server <STEAM_0:1:55356759> (took 67 seconds).
[16:04:35] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: Alright, alright. I'm going to be completely honest with you.
[16:04:52] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: I just wanted to kill people, I didn't care about Universal Union or Combine, I just wanted to kill people.
[16:05:08] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.91412: hm

[16:06:09] CCA.C17-JUDGE.OfC.91412: Good thing you won't remember. You're openly admitting you are a terrorist, then.
[16:06:40] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: Eh, I never set any bombs or anything, so I wouldn't call myself a terrorist.
[16:06:47] Jimmy 'Watcher 3' John: I think deranged mass murderer is more fitting.
