[21:55:13] Freluci: /v He lives!
[21:55:15] Har Tunn: .// took me a sec, im shavin down this block of wood
[21:55:19] Freluci: .//lmao
[21:55:29] Freluci: /v Now, let us find a way out of this cave.
[21:55:33] Har Tunn: /v Did i fall?
[21:55:38] Freluci: /v Indeed. You were bleeding.
[21:55:41] Galargalar'Ralag: /vort Yes.
[21:55:42] Kal'Taar: /vort Where will we go? Back to the Between? We cannot stay there.
[21:55:47] Har Tunn: /V I was unsure it was possible for me to bleed.
[21:56:14] Galargalar'Ralag: /vort The more knowledge, the better off.
[21:56:19] Freluci: /v I do not know where is safe. Our settlement is in much greater peril than before.
[21:56:32] Freluci: /v I believe we should fight for our settlement, but I fear for our well-being.
[21:56:32] Mak 'Braam: /vort This one has found nothing in the room behind. The exit must be towards the opposite end of this cavern.
[21:56:37] Kal'Taar: /vort This entire planet collapses. I believe the Masked ones already harvest it.
[21:56:48] Freluci: /v Have our kin left already? Do they wait for us?
[21:56:49] Kal'Taar: /vort I will go ahead.
[21:56:52] Freluci: /v What are we to do?
[21:57:12] Freluci: /v Surely you all understand my trouble.
[21:57:15] Mak 'Braam: /vort We must search, at least for a short while. 
[21:57:36] Mak 'Braam: /vort The risk of leaving any remaining kin is too great to ignore.
[21:57:48] Freluci: /v Agreed. We must search for any survivors.
[21:58:10] Freluci: /v First, however, we need to find a way up.
[21:58:18] Mak 'Braam: /vort This hole leads nowhere, this one has already checked.
[21:58:19] Freluci: /v If I have been told right, there is a path here.
[21:58:20] Kal'Taar: /vort The tunnels extend this way.
[21:58:41] Freluci: //ignore the french flag
[21:58:47] Freluci: //and the lambda
[21:58:53] Freluci: Ah.
[21:58:54] Har Tunn: // trying to WASD while using a sanding belt is so fuckin annoying
[21:58:54] Freluci: /v Ah.
[21:58:57] Freluci: /v So we have found a way.
[21:59:10] Freluci: /v So we must enter.
