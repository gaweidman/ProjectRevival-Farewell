[13:03:56] Jim Stinson: Question- eh.. sir, what's with the armband?
[13:04:01] Dustin Rory: Hm? ah.
[13:04:08] Dustin Rory: Do you not know the loyalist armbands?
[13:04:25] Jim Stinson: I've heard of em' in other cities yeah- Just wanted to confirm.
[13:04:34] Jim Stinson: They look different from wherever ya' go you see.
[13:04:42] Dustin Rory: I have over 50 loyalty points, all granted by the powerful Universal Union.
[13:04:56] Jim Stinson: Fifty!? Yikes...
[13:05:01] Dustin Rory: Let me get an exact number, excuse me for a moment.
[13:05:06] CCA.C17-GRID.i2.36307: 55
[13:05:06] Jim Stinson: Those numbers put me to shame, goodness gracious...
[13:05:12] Dustin Rory: 55 to be exact.
[13:05:23] Jim Stinson: Wow.
[13:05:35] Jim Stinson: How'd you earn all of that anyhow?
[13:05:35] Dustin Rory: Don't worry, I know you can get there if I have.
[13:05:44] Dustin Rory: Hm......that is private information you see.
[13:05:55] Jim Stinson: Oh...
[13:06:17] Jim Stinson: Can't even put me in the right direction eh-? Must be work cycles or somethin'... Or uhh- 
[13:06:23] Jim Stinson: Workers Union n' stuff...
[13:06:47] CCA.C17-GRID.i2.36307: /me would have a flashback(tm) to the C14 Clinic 
[13:06:50] Dustin Rory: Hm.....doing just about anything for the Universal Union can get you Loyalty Points, but the best way i've found is exposing the dirty anti-citizens.
[13:07:05] Dustin Rory: Although, such things can get you in trouble.
[13:07:09] Dustin Rory: Only do it when the time has come.
[13:07:11] Jim Stinson: I was gonna say.
[13:07:43] Jim Stinson: That's gotta be some shady stuff right er'... I think I'll just stick to work instead, I like to work with my hands so I think of it as a win win.
[13:07:56] Dustin Rory: Hmph.....that would be better.
[13:08:32] Dustin Rory: Such things i've done are not the best routes to getting Loyalty Points, i've seen death traded in for LP and what not.
[13:08:57] Jim Stinson: Eh-... I'm not even gonna ask heh...
[13:09:01] Dustin Rory: Good.
[13:09:05] Jim Stinson: /me he would awkwardly chuckle afterward
[13:09:25] Dustin Rory: Why are you going for LP?
[13:09:58] Jim Stinson: /me "Oh-" he turns over to face the nexus, "To one day join em' folks."
[13:10:27] Dustin Rory: Good to know, having CCA officers protecting those worthy of joining the Universal Union is always a good thing to hear.
[13:10:42] Dustin Rory: And those attempting to join such a thing is also good to hear.
[13:11:00] Jim Stinson: That's nice- I hope you hear it often.
[13:11:27] Jim Stinson: Although that might not be much of a good thing for me, considering I'd have to fight my chances against other applicants...
[13:12:04] Dustin Rory: Hmph.....if the Universal Union finds that you're worthy, they will call for you and allow you to join.
[13:12:07] Dustin Rory: That much I can promise.
[13:12:24] Jim Stinson: /me nods whislt the man speaks, "Mhmm. Makes sense to me."
[13:12:42] Dustin Rory: Indeed so, but....I have businees to attend to.
[13:12:49] Dustin Rory: I will see you at a later date I suppose.
[13:13:02] Jim Stinson: Right then, Yes. See ya'.
