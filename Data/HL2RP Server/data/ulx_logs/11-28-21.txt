[00:28:34] Mak 'Braam: /vort Let us hope for safe passage. We must move forward.
[00:28:38] Galargalar'Ralag: /vort But an exit? Only through trial may we find out. This one will go first.

[00:49:47] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: /me would stand against the wall, hiding.
[00:49:49] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: /me would take out his combat knife and cut the individual's ties.
[00:49:53] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: .//voi that, bind
[00:49:59] Mak 'Braam: /vort Maybe this one would know his way around this place.
[00:50:26] Mak 'Braam: /vort We may not have the time to assist but with more of us we stand a better chance at the unknown.
[00:50:43] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: /me would look around nervously.
[00:51:05] Mak 'Braam: /me would examine the terminal
[00:51:14] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: /me would stand in front of it and shake his head.
[00:51:33] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: /me makes a throat cutting motion, then points at the door.
[00:51:57] Mak 'Braam: /vort This one probably knows what lies beyond this door. We should follow their unspoken advice and continue on.
[00:52:06] Galargalar'Ralag: /me nods his head.
[00:52:21] Mak 'Braam: /vort As for the other kin, we surely do not have the time to save them sadly.
[00:52:46] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: /me holds up his arm before the other vortigaunts can walk poast him.
[00:53:09] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: /it You hear speech, again, in an unfamiliar language. It's vocoded.
[00:53:25] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: /it It's the same language the slave vortigaunt was speaking in, though. 
[00:53:50] Mak 'Braam: /me would speak in a quieter voice,
[00:54:06] Mak 'Braam: /vort What is our next plan?
[00:54:24] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: /me would point toward the forcefield, then make a zap attack gesture. Then he makes an explosion gesture. Then he makes a run gesture. Then he makes a door opening gesture.
[00:54:48] Galargalar'Ralag: /vort To find another portal, and to find a safer place.
[00:55:26] Mak 'Braam: /vort I think we must destroy the barrier, that must be our way forward.
[00:56:02] Mak 'Braam: /vort Voices are near, when we act, we must act fast and be ready.
[00:56:02] Client "Myoga The Flea" spawned in server <STEAM_0:0:52946002> (took 563 seconds).
[00:56:08] Galargalar'Ralag: /me points to the field, then to the side of the field, seeing where exactly.
[00:56:08] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: .//fuck
[00:56:35] Mak 'Braam: /looc I recognize the steam name of the person joining from somewhere, cant remember where tho
[00:56:57] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: /me points to the field, then makes an explosion gesture, then points backwards into the alley from where they came. Then he makes a door opening gestures.
[00:57:02] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: .//gesture*
[00:57:19] Myoga The Flea<STEAM_0:0:52946002> changed their name to Paul Krieg
[00:57:29] Galargalar'Ralag: /me fires a bolt into the forcefield.
[00:57:45] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: /it The forcefield goes down. The slave vortigaunt takes off down the alley.

[01:00:02] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: //LMAO
[01:00:29] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: /me would grab a sharp object off of the table.
[01:01:09] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: /me would run up to a shackle bearing. He chains himself in, not locking it, and then begins to dig into himself with the xacto knife he picked up.
[01:01:33] Mak 'Braam: /looc a shackle bearing?
[01:01:34] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: /me would bite his lip, trying not ot scream in opain. He doesn't screma, but he's whimpering pretty awfully.
[01:01:46] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: .//like a thing in the wall you can use to chian someone up to
[01:01:52] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: //like a metal loop in the wall that has a chain on it
[01:02:03] Galargalar'Ralag: .// self circumcision
[01:02:28] Mak 'Braam: /me would use some of his power to help relieve the vortigaunts pains with chanting and glowing hands.
[01:02:39] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: /it He's cutting around some of his shackles. He seems to be fairly inaccurate, but hopefully it's good enough to do whatevef he's trying to od.
[01:02:53] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: /it After some time of sad whimpering, it's done. The vortigaunt is bleeding, but his shackles are out.
[01:02:57] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: /it At least, some of them.
[01:03:04] Galargalar'Ralag: /me stands at the door, ready to protect the group.
[01:03:07] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: /v I need... a bandage... or biogel... Immediately.

[01:04:31] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: /v I'll find something...
[01:04:40] Mak 'Braam: /vort We have been dropped here from a different world with nothing but ourselves.
[01:05:02] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: /me would unchain himself and shamble, which is a strong word for what he's doing, because he's barely able to shample, across the room.
[01:05:18] Mak 'Braam: /vort This one would hope you know a way out of this world.
[01:05:50] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: /v If we keep talking, I'll catch a one-way train directly out of this world.
[01:06:11] CAC.B49-VRP.05498<STEAM_0:1:53097688> spawned model models/props_combine/health_charger001.mdl
[01:06:16] Mak 'Braam: /me would help the vortigaunt walk
[01:06:34] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: /me would approach the medical station and rip out the antlion vial.
[01:06:51] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: /me would unscrew the top and begin rubbing biogel onto his wounds.
[01:07:26] Mak 'Braam: /vort Is there anything this one can do at this moment in time?
[01:07:41] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: /v Healing magic would be nice.
[01:07:45] Client "Myoga The Flea" connected.
[01:07:47] CAC.B49-VRP.05498: /me would proceed to use some healing magic on himself as well.
[01:07:49] CAC.B49-VRP.05498 set the hp for Everyone to 5

[01:09:27] Mak 'Braam: /me raises his hands towards the huddled vortigaunt and begins to hum words in vortigese with glowing hands.
[01:09:44] Galargalar'Ralag: /me pulls vortessence together to heal the enslaved vortigaunt.
[01:09:48] Client "Myoga The Flea" spawned in server <STEAM_0:0:52946002> (took 123 seconds).

[01:12:43] Galargalar'Ralag: /vort Afterwards, we arrived here.

[02:07:35] Freluci: /v Are we brothers?
[02:07:45] Freluci: /v How can one be a brother of the self?
[02:07:50] Freluci: /v We are one, the vortigaunt.
[02:07:59] Freluci: /v But we act otherwise. We act as if we're different.
[02:08:19] Mak 'Braam: /vort We are all different but are each other.
[02:08:33] Freluci: /v A contradiction, to be sure.
[02:08:43] Mak 'Braam: /vort Such is the way that is.
[02:09:00] Freluci: /v But why?
[02:09:11] Mak 'Braam: /vort That is not for this one to decided.
[02:09:15] Mak 'Braam: /looc decide*
[02:09:23] Freluci: /v But why?
[02:09:24] Galargalar'Ralag: /v It has been decided long before us.
[02:09:30] Freluci: /v Why can't we, ourselves, decide, for ourselves?
[02:09:37] Freluci: /v We act as a whole, but we don't act it.
[02:09:43] Freluci: /v In our language, we say the opposite.
[02:09:47] Freluci: /v But we're somehow one?
[02:09:57] Freluci: /v Nonsensical at best.
[02:10:21] Mak 'Braam: /vort How is it our paths cross again brother?
[02:10:41] Freluci: /v Our paths do not cross. Our paths have crossed, and continue to be crossed.
[02:10:52] Mak 'Braam: /vort Our paths are one in the same.
[02:11:05] Freluci: /v Our paths are tightly woven.
[02:11:18] Freluci: /v Vortal cords.
[02:11:27] Freluci: /v The vortessence has taken me here. It has made you follow.
[02:11:44] Freluci: /v The purpose of larval essence is to dissolve the false veils of space and time.
[02:11:58] Freluci: /v Remove the "here". Only leave us.
[02:12:23] Mak 'Braam: /vort We must leave here. It is too dangerous for us.
[02:12:24] Freluci: /v I have seen far, far more than that.
[02:12:28] Freluci: /v I have seen no veil.
[02:12:35] Freluci: /v I can assure you, we are safe.
