[Wed Dec 16 00:34:39 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: /c If I give you one of those gag styluses, the kind that shock you when you click it, is that an attack?
[Wed Dec 16 00:34:43 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: /c No, it's just a little zap.
[Wed Dec 16 00:34:58 2020] <STEAM_0:1:74406306> Crewman Third Class Red Giddeon: /c of a much lower voltage
[Wed Dec 16 00:35:01 2020] <STEAM_0:0:70853523> Flight Sub-Lieutenant Erik Crogour: Come with me, let's find this guy.

[Wed Dec 16 00:36:20 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: /c Again, it gives jolts.
[Wed Dec 16 00:36:31 2020] <STEAM_0:1:74406306> Crewman Third Class Red Giddeon: /c may have not been your droid, but ive seen some pretty messed up droid battles with those things
[Wed Dec 16 00:36:36 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: /c It's used to zap electronics at a small voltage.
[Wed Dec 16 00:36:42 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: /c Okay? Those are battle droids.
[Wed Dec 16 00:36:45 2020] <STEAM_0:0:70853523> Flight Sub-Lieutenant Erik Crogour: There you are.
[Wed Dec 16 00:36:46 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: Hello, Crogour.
[Wed Dec 16 00:36:52 2020] <STEAM_0:1:74406306> Crewman Third Class Red Giddeon: Pritcher
[Wed Dec 16 00:36:58 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: You realize battle droids are different from astromechs?
[Wed Dec 16 00:37:06 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: Again, they're programatically incapable of killing.
[Wed Dec 16 00:37:08 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: As well as physically.
[Wed Dec 16 00:37:17 2020] <STEAM_0:1:74406306> Crewman Third Class Red Giddeon: No no, after the clone wars
[Wed Dec 16 00:37:22 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: Dark Troopers?
[Wed Dec 16 00:37:27 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: Those are *made* to kill.
[Wed Dec 16 00:37:30 2020] <STEAM_0:1:74406306> Crewman Third Class Red Giddeon: Ive seen ASTROMECHS
[Wed Dec 16 00:37:31 2020] <STEAM_0:0:70853523> Flight Sub-Lieutenant Erik Crogour: In a second here you'll wish you were transfered to a different base.
[Wed Dec 16 00:37:37 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: You definitely haven't.
[Wed Dec 16 00:37:41 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: /me looks at crogour.
[Wed Dec 16 00:37:49 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: You're getting really angry over something you shouldn't be.
[Wed Dec 16 00:38:02 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: And I can assure you I won't.
[Wed Dec 16 00:38:20 2020] <STEAM_0:1:74406306> Crewman Third Class Red Giddeon: its enough having to deal with the shit that we do, and its not helping that your little droid buzz around us shocking us
[Wed Dec 16 00:38:37 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: It shocked you once, because your Crogour insulted it.
[Wed Dec 16 00:38:47 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: Call someone ugly to their face and see what they say or do.
[Wed Dec 16 00:38:56 2020] <STEAM_0:0:70853523> Flight Sub-Lieutenant Erik Crogour: /me gets into a fighting position
[Wed Dec 16 00:39:09 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: Why in the hell do you look like you're about to fighT?
[Wed Dec 16 00:39:13 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: Do you think I want to fight you?
[Wed Dec 16 00:39:13 2020] <STEAM_0:1:74406306> Crewman Third Class Red Giddeon: thats my point pritchett, they shouldnt have that emotion
[Wed Dec 16 00:39:21 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: There's no harm in it, ask my superiors.
[Wed Dec 16 00:39:37 2020] <STEAM_0:1:74406306> Crewman Third Class Red Giddeon: it slows down the progress of the Empire
[Wed Dec 16 00:39:38 2020] <STEAM_0:0:70853523> Flight Sub-Lieutenant Erik Crogour: You're starting to sound like a Rebel activist.
[Wed Dec 16 00:39:42 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: I'm not.
[Wed Dec 16 00:39:50 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: I'm defending a droid that you offended.
[Wed Dec 16 00:40:06 2020] <STEAM_0:1:74406306> Crewman Third Class Red Giddeon: you ever hear about the spice mines of kessel? are you one of those kinda activists?
[Wed Dec 16 00:40:31 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: Can't say it rings a bell. You can't be serious. What reason do you have to think I'm a Rebel?
[Wed Dec 16 00:40:40 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: You mean because I disagree with you?
[Wed Dec 16 00:40:47 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: Again, I was just angry with you.
[Wed Dec 16 00:40:50 2020] <STEAM_0:0:70853523> Flight Sub-Lieutenant Erik Crogour: You're protecting a droid.
[Wed Dec 16 00:40:52 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: Yes.
[Wed Dec 16 00:40:57 2020] <STEAM_0:1:74406306> Crewman Third Class Red Giddeon: A non living thing
[Wed Dec 16 00:40:58 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: I'm protecting imperial property.
[Wed Dec 16 00:41:09 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: That's my job.
[Wed Dec 16 00:41:12 2020] <STEAM_0:1:74406306> Crewman Third Class Red Giddeon: imperial property that is slowing down our flow
[Wed Dec 16 00:41:19 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: When people kick them, it makes my job harder, because I have to repair and polish them.
[Wed Dec 16 00:41:28 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: Again, it's amazing at navigation. It's an astromech.
[Wed Dec 16 00:41:35 2020] <STEAM_0:0:70853523> Flight Sub-Lieutenant Erik Crogour: If a droid is slowing down our flow here at the base it's in clear violation of Darth vader.
[Wed Dec 16 00:41:42 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: .//Lord Vader*
[Wed Dec 16 00:41:44 2020] <STEAM_0:1:74406306> Crewman Third Class Red Giddeon: please give me an example of just once that little astromech helped today.
[Wed Dec 16 00:41:46 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: .//nobody calls him darth, nobody knows that title

[Wed Dec 16 00:42:01 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: How is it slowing donw the flow?
[Wed Dec 16 00:42:08 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: Because it didn't have an immediate job so it was roaming?
[Wed Dec 16 00:42:19 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: That's what most inactive droids do, unless they're in the shop or in storage.
[Wed Dec 16 00:42:21 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: This is absurd.
[Wed Dec 16 00:42:34 2020] <STEAM_0:1:74406306> Crewman Third Class Red Giddeon: getting in the way, shocking troopers after a little pointless insult
[Wed Dec 16 00:42:58 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: Again, if you call a human or, really, anything living ugly, they won't be happy with you.
[Wed Dec 16 00:43:06 2020] <STEAM_0:1:74406306> Crewman Third Class Red Giddeon: ITS NOT HUMAN
[Wed Dec 16 00:43:14 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: It still has a personality.
[Wed Dec 16 00:43:15 2020] <STEAM_0:1:74406306> Crewman Third Class Red Giddeon: ITS NOT LIVING
[Wed Dec 16 00:43:20 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: Okay, it has a personality.
[Wed Dec 16 00:43:20 2020] <STEAM_0:0:70853523> Flight Sub-Lieutenant Erik Crogour: /me throws a punch towards Pritchett "Enough with your pro droid bullshit!"

[Wed Dec 16 00:44:59 2020] <STEAM_0:1:74406306> Crewman Third Class Red Giddeon: We can take care of that another way, beating the shit out of him will only cause more problems for us
[Wed Dec 16 00:45:37 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: Being pro-droid isn't being pro-rebel. That's not even close to the same thing.
[Wed Dec 16 00:45:41 2020] <STEAM_0:1:53097688> Petty Officer First Class Cynthia Pritchett: The two aren't related.
