[Thu Dec 24 00:15:51 2020] <STEAM_0:0:69476140> Air Private First Class Charlie Black: You ever fly atmospheric?
[Thu Dec 24 00:16:11 2020] <STEAM_0:0:70853523> Flight Sub-Lieutenant Erik Crogour: Yeah.
[Thu Dec 24 00:16:33 2020] <STEAM_0:0:70853523> Flight Sub-Lieutenant Erik Crogour: Every now and then.
[Thu Dec 24 00:16:38 2020] <STEAM_0:0:69476140> Air Private First Class Charlie Black: I see.
[Thu Dec 24 00:17:50 2020] <STEAM_0:0:70853523> Flight Sub-Lieutenant Erik Crogour: Yeah....
[Thu Dec 24 00:18:30 2020] <STEAM_0:0:69476140> Air Private First Class Charlie Black: What's it like to fly without gravity?
[Thu Dec 24 00:19:18 2020] <STEAM_0:0:70853523> Flight Sub-Lieutenant Erik Crogour: Sometimes I can't tell, you're going too fast too realize.
[Thu Dec 24 00:19:45 2020] <STEAM_0:0:69476140> Air Private First Class Charlie Black: Oh so just like with gravity.
[Thu Dec 24 00:20:00 2020] <STEAM_0:0:70853523> Flight Sub-Lieutenant Erik Crogour: Well....
[Thu Dec 24 00:20:03 2020] <STEAM_0:0:70853523> Flight Sub-Lieutenant Erik Crogour: Yes and no.
[Thu Dec 24 00:20:08 2020] <STEAM_0:0:69476140> Air Private First Class Charlie Black: How so?
[Thu Dec 24 00:20:45 2020] <STEAM_0:0:70853523> Flight Sub-Lieutenant Erik Crogour: You can move a lot better with no gravity, since there isn't a third force pulling on the craft.
[Thu Dec 24 00:20:49 2020] <STEAM_0:0:70853523> Flight Sub-Lieutenant Erik Crogour: Y'know?
[Thu Dec 24 00:20:54 2020] <STEAM_0:0:69476140> Air Private First Class Charlie Black: Must be nice.
[Thu Dec 24 00:21:27 2020] <STEAM_0:0:69476140> Air Private First Class Charlie Black: Though I guess if you get shot down, you don't really have a second chance.
