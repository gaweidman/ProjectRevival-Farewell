[19:49:31] Lord Vader: /c Let us begin.
[19:50:00] Lieutenant Shunk Tump: // balls
[19:50:03] Lord Vader: /c Several days ago, we were made aware of a force growing in the Unknown Regions. An old force originating from a defector from our ranks.
[19:50:04] Lance Corporal Lastimosa 'Marauder' Oldblood: // balls
[19:50:32] Lord Vader: /c He has been growing his forces in the Unknown Region, trying to create an empire to oppose our own.
[19:50:38] Lord Vader: /c He will not succeed. We will not allow it.
[19:50:56] Crewman Third Class Tiraan Malway: /pm Lord weird campaign event but I like it.
[19:51:01] Lord Vader: /c After raiding one of their bases of operations, we found-
[19:51:35] Lord Vader: /c We found out much about their cause.
[19:52:11] Lord Vader: /c We abducted one of their leaders, a man named Umami Limon. After interrogating him, we now know that he seeks to find the, for lack of a better term that would not require hours of explaining, the journal of one Darth Derran.
[19:52:18] Lieutenant Shunk Tump: // umami lemon
[19:52:22] Lord Vader: //actually it's a holocron but we don't have time to explain that ICly
[19:52:34] Petty Officer Third Class Kariss Novar: .// unami lemon
[19:52:41] Petty Officer Third Class Kariss Novar: // unami lemon
[19:53:16] Lord Vader: /c This leader did not know the whereabouts of this journal, but they know someone who might. The leader of a cell in the Ord Mantell system.
[19:53:48] Lord Vader: /c Specifically the scraplands, a place known for being rife with the lowest of society's inhabitants.
[19:54:11] Lord Vader: /c Today, you will depart and infilitrate their cell, disguising yourselves as members of their cause by any means possible.
[19:54:19] Lord Vader: /c We depart for the system shortly.
[19:55:23] Lieutenant Shunk Tump: // nipples > nepal
[19:55:28] Lord Vader: /c Our mission is to find out the location of Darth Derran's tomb, which contains his journal. Either by interrogating their leader, or more subtly by intercepting their information system ourselves.
[19:55:39] Petty Officer Third Class Kariss Novar: // afk
[19:55:46] Lord Vader: /c I will not be accompanying you, as my recognizable appearance will jeopardize the covert nature of the mission.
[19:55:52] Lord Vader: /c Are there any questions?
[19:56:02] Lord Vader: Yes?
[19:56:08] Crewman Third Class Tiraan Malway: /pm Lord I hate the lance corporal.
[19:56:15] Lord Vader: .//can you repeat that, becuase you're cutting out big time
[19:56:36] Lord Vader: /c Speak like you aren't concussed, and I will answer your question.
[19:56:38] Lord Vader: /c Anyone else?
[19:56:43] Lord Vader: /c No?
[19:57:24] Lord Vader: /c Then you all are dismissed to the armory. Captain Thadeus Forzla of the ISB will be waiting for you there with further instruction.
[19:57:26] Lord Vader: /c Dismissed.
