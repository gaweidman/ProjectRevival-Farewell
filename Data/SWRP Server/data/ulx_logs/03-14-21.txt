[22:32:35] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': /c From the looks of it the Sniper died or gave up and dropped his sniper rifle.
[22:32:43] Commander LS-5201: /c Hm
[22:32:45] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': /c Probably the first one.
[22:32:52] Commander LS-5201: /c Not sure what would have killed him.
[22:33:00] Commander LS-5201: /c Not much harmful wildlife above ground.
[22:33:08] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': /c True but I doubt he just dropped his rifle and left.
[22:33:17] Commander LS-5201: /c Also true.
[22:33:39] Commander LS-5201: /c Fakeout maybe? Make you think he's dead or unarmed so you can let your guard down.
[22:33:48] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': /c Possibly
[22:34:09] Commander LS-5201: /c Keep in mind half the people that come in from there have blunt force trauma. These guys can do hand-to-hand combat.
[22:34:12] Commander LS-5201: /c Well, I may add.
[22:34:38] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': /c I can handle myself in hand-to-hand combat but if it's more than one guy then i'm kind of fucked.
[22:34:55] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': /c So lets hope it doesn't come to that.
[22:34:58] Commander LS-5201: /c Well, you had better get to leveling the playng field, Sergeant.
[22:35:42] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': /c Affirmative, I recommend you get a few scouts to search for that sniper.

[23:32:12] ???: And destroyed our democracy.

[23:34:07] ???: They support a dictatorship never seen before in... thousands of years.
[23:34:20] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Once again, not really, but also i've seen what the rebels have done to innoccent soldiers trying to make a living.
[23:34:39] Private TK-7134: The Empire provides security, stability. What is wrong with that?
[23:34:42] ???: I've seen what stormtroopers to do innocent women and children who have the misfortune to have a father who resists.
[23:34:59] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Private, don't act like we haven't done shitty things before.
[23:35:14] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': While the Empire does give those things it has also done bad things.
[23:35:24] ???: So means to an end, then? That's what you think?
[23:35:52] Private TK-7134: Yes. Some people have to suffer for the greater good to be achieved
[23:36:14] ???: Then I guess you've already been subjected to the conditioning.
[23:36:20] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': /me Simply relaxes as much as he can while in a metal chair after being kidnapped, spoiler alert he can't relax much.
[23:36:20] ???: The answer to your question, private, we're here to liberate the galaxy in whatever way we can.

[23:37:03] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Alright guard, I think it's about time you face reality.
[23:37:10] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': You can't do shit with your situation.
[23:37:46] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Like you are so absolutely backed into a corner it's mind boggeling, but I can't talk much considering my situation isn't exactly the best either.
[23:38:20] Private TK-7134: What do you plan to do? Kidnap a few troopers? Steal a few gunships? What change would that bring?
[23:38:36] ???: We can, at the very least, keep naboo city safe from further oppression.
[23:38:47] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': How strong do you think you are?
[23:38:56] ???: We've made it this far.
[23:39:05] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': As stated only three of you are left.
[23:39:22] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Three men against a small army isn't exactly the best odds.
[23:39:25] ???: Sorry to burst your bubble, but 3 commandos can do as much as a platoon of stormtroopers.
[23:39:32] ???: Given the proper planning.
[23:40:11] Private TK-7134: So, where do we fall in place in this scheme of yours?
[23:40:16] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Okay, well tell me what happens once those three men are victories but then the Empire send a small army to retake the city?
[23:40:28] ???: We fight back.
[23:40:34] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Great plan
[23:40:38] ???: And, private, great question.
[23:40:44] ???: I'm getting distracted, I need to get back to that.
[23:40:51] ???: As you can imagine, there's a reason you're still alive.

[23:43:04] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Oh great, can I take you out for a beer beforehand?
[23:43:06] ???: .//INTERROGATOR I MEANT
[23:43:18] ???: .//i'm only slightly stupid
[23:43:26] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': .// Nah, this is an execution now.
[23:43:29] Private TK-7134: /looc lol, I was gonna do a quippy remark about that
[23:43:33] ???: .//who's being executed though hmmmmm
[23:43:38] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': .// Me please
[23:43:40] ???: Very funny. Let me tighten those restrains.
[23:43:45] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': .// I'm bad at RP and deserve it.
[23:43:45] ???: .//restraints.*
[23:44:26] ???: /me would approach the rangetrooper and grab the knob controlling his head restraint. He slowly tightens it, creating an uncomfortably firm grip on his forehead.
[23:44:37] ???: /it As he does this, his holster is just in reach of the Private.
[23:44:44] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': .// PRIVATE
[23:44:48] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': .// DO WHAT MUST BE DONE
[23:44:57] Private TK-7134: /looc Hmm...
[23:44:59] ???: /it He can *just* reach the DC-17 in the holster, maybe even aim it.
[23:45:26] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': .// Is he performing?
[23:45:28] ???: .//the action command is /me
[23:45:30] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': .// Oh shit
[23:45:30] ???: .//he is
[23:45:47] Private TK-7134: /me I'd reach for the gun, and aim it for the Guard's head
[23:46:07] ???: /it He is none the wiser, too busy looking at the range trooper and trying to get a gauge of his pain.
[23:46:26] Private TK-7134: /me after several seconds of getting the perfect aim, he'd fire a single shot
[23:47:12] ???: /it Given that your hand wasn't exactly in the best aiming position, you're a little off, but it's a stroke of luck. You shoot him right in the neck. He falls, choking.
[23:47:16] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': /me Flinches from the shot (due to it being near his head) and simply stays quiet trying to listen for any other footsteps.
[23:47:45] Private TK-7134: /looc how restrained am I rn?
[23:47:47] ???: /me would reach for his comlink, but is too busy shaking from the shock caused by putting a hole right in his neck.
[23:47:54] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Good shot Private
[23:48:02] ???: .//Wrists, ankles, scalp.
[23:48:12] ???: .//there's a way to free yourself
[23:48:30] ???: /me dies.
[23:48:34] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': // F
[23:48:39] Private TK-7134: /me would fight the restraints, but continue to fail in the process
[23:48:50] ???<STEAM_0:1:53097688> spawned ragdoll models/aussiwozzi/senatecommandos/senate_commando_trooper.mdl
[23:48:56] ???: //if you can get it, you get a cookie
[23:49:15] Private TK-7134: /ooc I like cookies
[23:49:20] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': You think you could shoot my restraints or could you get out yourself?
[23:49:39] Private TK-7134: I'll try releasing you first, sir
[23:50:02] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Alright, try to not shoot my arm if you can.
[23:50:15] Private TK-7134: /me would shoot one of the wrist restraints of the Sergeant, aiming it carefully
[23:50:29] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': .// We are too dumby for doing this right so time to shoot the locks instead.
[23:50:32] ???: /it A hit! It's broken open. Close shot, though. Risky.
[23:50:40] ???: .//that's literally the right way
[23:50:44] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': .// Bruh
[23:50:56] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': .// I was expecting a smarter way out
[23:50:58] Private TK-7134: /ooc bruh
[23:51:09] ???: //there's a very smart way of doing it now but i'm the GM so i can't say :)
[23:51:20] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': /me With one hand freed he unlocks his other restraints and gets the fuck out of the chair.
[23:51:25] ???: //oh yeah
[23:51:25] ???: //that's
[23:51:29] ???: //yeah that's right
[23:51:30] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': // Wha
[23:51:34] ???: //i'm an idiot lmao
[23:51:37] ???: /it Yep, that works.
[23:51:37] Private TK-7134: Ah, victory
[23:51:45] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': /me Starts freeing the TK.
[23:51:52] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Watch the door
[23:51:59] Private TK-7134: Roger that
[23:52:09] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': /me Grabs the body of the Guard and searches it for the Comlink and any gun he could have.
[23:52:35] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': // Anything?
[23:52:46] ???: /it The comlink is working, but tuned to the wrong frequency. As the other comlinks, you don't see a way to change the frequency. Crummy, cheap model, you guess. He also has another DC-17. He was fighting akimbo.
[23:52:51] ??? gave Everyone rw_sw_dc17_purge
[23:52:56] ???: //both of you should have the DC-17
[23:53:01] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': // Coolio
[23:53:03] ???: //it's purge but pretend it's the blue version
[23:53:16] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Alright, we're dealing with some strong as hell soldiers so lets avoid combat at all costs.
[23:53:28] Private TK-7134: Yes, sir
[23:53:45] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': If we get into combat and you feel as though you're gonna die then run away without me.
[23:53:55] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Got it?
[23:53:57] ???: /toggleraise
[23:54:00] Private TK-7134: Understood
[23:54:02] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Good
[23:54:10] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Also one second, watch the door, blasters off safety.
[23:54:45] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Alright, get on my side and we'll open it up.
[23:55:56] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Fuckin hell
[23:56:16] Private TK-7134: ...
[23:56:19] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Alright, we'll report this to command and see what happens.
[23:56:25] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Got it?
[23:56:29] Private TK-7134: Yes, sir
[23:56:34] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Good, then lets get moving back to base.
[23:56:40] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Wait
[23:56:43] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Fuck!
[23:56:47] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Welp
[23:56:51] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': No way out
[23:56:56] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': I have an idea
[23:57:00] Private TK-7134: Let's hear it
[23:57:04] ???: /it Looks like somebody's gotta face the music.
[23:57:29] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': They have a massive laser gun in that base, we could use it to blow up that rock barrier.
[23:57:32] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Fuck
[23:57:33] Private TK-7134: Oh no
[23:57:40] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': We have to do it.
[23:58:33] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': /w The hell?
[23:58:53] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Grab one
[23:59:12] ???: /it You'd recognize it anywhere, that's imperial tech!
[23:59:18] ???: /it Looks like your stolen stuff.
[23:59:21] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Thats a Squad device!
[23:59:23] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Take one
