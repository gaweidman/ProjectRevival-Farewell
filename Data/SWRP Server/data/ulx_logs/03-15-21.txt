[00:21:19] Commander LS-5201: /y I guess I was right to trust 394th.
[00:21:43] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Yeah, we got ambushed, kidnapped, and escaped on this thing to sum up what happened./
[00:21:53] Private TK-7134: What he said
[00:21:58] Commander LS-5201: Yeah, you were out for... three hours.
[00:22:00] Commander LS-5201: Yeah, three.
[00:22:27] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': The vigilantes were the old senate guards or whatever they were called.
[00:22:35] Commander LS-5201: Really?
[00:22:39] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Seems like it
[00:22:41] Private TK-7134: Indeed

[00:23:11] Private TK-7134: Possibly
[00:23:18] Commander LS-5201: Possibly.
[00:23:22] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Only one of them is alive, though he's injured and trapped inside one of the bases.
[00:23:36] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': He'll probably starve to death.
[00:23:46] Commander LS-5201: We might want to get him for interrogation, but if he's trapped and in a corner, we'll probably go and get him for questioning.
[00:24:04] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': I shot him with one of those beam lasers on the LAAT or whatever it's called.
[00:24:05] Commander LS-5201: 1 man against several squads should be an easy capture.
[00:24:21] Commander LS-5201: Yeah, I heard an explosion and a landslide, was that your doing?
[00:24:44] Commander LS-5201: Well, *I*. We all heard it.
[00:24:46] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': They barricaded us in using this thing, they partially blew up the mountain to trap us.
[00:24:57] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': That caused that sound.
[00:25:28] Commander LS-5201: Well, I guess what they say about 394th is right. You all are a bunch of maniacs, but you're fine soldiers.
[00:25:37] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': thank you, sir.
[00:25:59] Commander LS-5201: I should be the ones thanking you.
