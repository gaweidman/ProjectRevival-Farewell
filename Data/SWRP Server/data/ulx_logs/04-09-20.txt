[22:08:23] Joseph Kimsler: .//i can't spell my own name
[22:08:32] Joseph Kimsler: So first off a couple of softball questions.
[22:08:37] Joseph Kimsler: What exactly is the CWU?
[22:09:16] Dropped "Guy Tastsuki" from server<STEAM_0:0:78553135>
[22:09:26] Zach Hadel: Well, CWU stands for Civil Workers Union and they're the workforce for the city. Things such as janitorial or medical jobs.
[22:09:47] Joseph Kimsler: Great, great.
[22:09:52] Joseph Kimsler: And what are you here to try out for?
[22:09:59] Client "NotUda" connected.
[22:10:01] Joseph Kimsler: Factory? Medical? Commerce?
[22:10:19] Zach Hadel: Well, I'd like to do Medical work if possible. Eventualy being able to work under the Consul at some point.
[22:10:30] Crow<STEAM_0:1:191784883> spawned model models/props_junk/plasticbucket001a.mdl
[22:10:46] Joseph Kimsler: Medical work? That's quite the goal, we never hear that response.
[22:10:52] Joseph Kimsler: Great to know.
[22:10:57] Zach Hadel: It's something I have a bit of experience in.
[22:11:13] Crow<STEAM_0:1:191784883> spawned model models/props_junk/garbage_metalcan002a.mdl
[22:11:16] Joseph Kimsler: That sort of leads me into my next questions. What prior experience do you have? Pre-war or otherwise?
[22:11:32] Client "NotUda" spawned in server <STEAM_0:0:54625514> (took 93 seconds).
[22:12:36] Zach Hadel: Pre-war, I worked as a sort of nurse for some summer camps and eventually went to work as a physician in a small town. Then during the war, I was drafted to treat anyone that needed it as medical experience was obviously in high demand.
[22:13:23] Crow: /ooc ima head off for the night, my f uc kin g do g escaped
[22:13:25] Dropped "Crow" from server<STEAM_0:1:191784883>
[22:13:38] Joseph Kimsler: Ah. that's great.
[22:13:47] Joseph Kimsler: And what sets you apart from other applicants?
[22:14:49] Zach Hadel: Drive. I feel that working for the CWU is me giving my appreciation back to the Union for removing the Xenians from our life as a threat. They've provided me housing and a life to live and this is my way to give back.
[22:15:00] Dropped "NotUda" from server<STEAM_0:0:54625514>
[22:15:10] Joseph Kimsler: Good, good.

[22:18:05] Zach Hadel: Well first of all, I'd make sure they're stabalized and if not make sure they get there. Second I'd immdedately contact the MPF and inform them I have a gunshot victim in my pocession and see what they say. I'd then begin doing the required medical work...
[22:18:09] Zach Hadel: ... on the wound.
[22:18:24] Joseph Kimsler: Great. What exactly would that medical work be?
[22:19:17] Zach Hadel: Removing the bullets, cleaning and cauterizing the wound, and do a bit of disinfecting just to start.
[22:19:43] Joseph Kimsler: Great.
[22:19:50] Joseph Kimsler: You seem very qualified.
