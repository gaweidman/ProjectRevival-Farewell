[00:18:09] Steven Walker: /ooc ye
[00:18:15] Gabe Hill: //well from a biased perspective
[00:18:19] Gabe Hill: //clockwork sucks monkey dick
[00:18:23] Steven Walker: /ooc You right
[00:18:26] Gabe Hill: //put more seriously
[00:18:34] Gabe Hill: //they advertised like a year back they would remove DRM january first 2020
[00:18:42] Gabe Hill: //or like two years? idfk
[00:18:50] Gabe Hill: //made a series of dumb decisions
[00:18:55] Gabe Hill: //such as player count licenses
[00:19:18] Gabe Hill: //so new purchasers of clockwork had to buy a license for the number of people they were expecting on their server
[00:19:26] Steven Walker: /ooc I give that
[00:19:27] Gabe Hill: //no i am not joking
[00:19:31] Steven Walker: /ooc 1 yike

[00:20:07] Gabe Hill: /doorsethidden true
[00:20:14] Gabe Hill: //but clockwork is ass
[00:20:18] Gabe Hill: //genuinely a shitty framework
[00:20:21] Gabe Hill: //made by shittier people
[00:20:37] Steven Walker: /ooc I booted this framework up for the first time and was pretty shocked on how smooth it feels
[00:20:41] Gabe Hill: //yeah
[00:20:42] Gabe Hill: //so
[00:20:45] Gabe Hill: //recently
[00:20:48] Gabe Hill: //not sure how recent
[00:20:58] Gabe Hill: //nebulous gets so big that they do the TnB thing and make their own gamemode
[00:21:05] Gabe Hill: //so here's what nebulous did right
[00:21:11] Gabe Hill: //they took nutscript 1.1
[00:21:19] Gabe Hill: //find and replace nut with ix
[00:21:20] Steven Walker: /ooc I had several whitelists on neb back in the day ;-;
[00:21:34] Gabe Hill: //added some visual stuff to improve it
[00:21:37] Steven Walker: /ooc No shit?
[00:21:39] Gabe Hill: //fixed a few small things and fixed it
[00:21:45] Gabe Hill: //then released it
[00:22:09] Gabe Hill: //so basically they reskinned nutscript with minor fixes
[00:22:18] Gabe Hill: //called it helix
[00:22:26] Gabe Hill: //and now it's the biggest framework
[00:22:44] Steven Walker: /ooc And somehow it's already 100x better than clockwork could ever be.
[00:22:54] Gabe Hill: //well yeah because nutscript is different from clockwork
[00:22:55] Gabe Hill: //in that
[00:22:56] Gabe Hill: //it's good
[00:23:09] Gabe Hill: //and then clockwork finally pulled the plug on its drm
[00:23:09] Gabe Hill: /doorsethidden true
[00:23:10] Gabe Hill: /uh
[00:23:11] Gabe Hill: //uh
[00:23:14] Steven Walker: /ooc Still can't get over how smooth this feels.
[00:23:14] Gabe Hill: //3 monthsd late
[00:23:22] Gabe Hill: //yeah, it's really pretty to look at
[00:23:26] Gabe Hill: //it handles well
[00:23:42] Steven Walker: /ooc How are the plugins doing?
[00:23:55] Steven Walker: /ooc Are people working on converting it for the new framework or?
[00:24:21] Steven Walker: /ooc Or has the entire library been dumpstered 
[00:24:42] Gabe Hill: //they have a conversion guide for converting clockwork shit into helixc
[00:24:46] Gabe Hill: //idk how good it is
[00:24:51] Gabe Hill: //my guess is dogshit
[00:24:53] Gabe Hill: //but idfk
[00:25:01] Gabe Hill: //right now there aren't many helix plugins
[00:25:02] Gabe Hill: //like at all
[00:25:11] Steven Walker: /ooc I sorta noticed that
[00:25:20] Gabe Hill: //not nearly as extensive as clockwork or nutscript
[00:25:25] Gabe Hill: //makes me sad
[00:25:33] Steven Walker: /ooc Jumped in front of a camera and was slightly dissapointed it didn't blink red and take my picture

[23:29:22] UU-SeC.17: Line up.
[23:29:29] UU-SeC.17: Alright.
[23:29:38] UU-SeC.17: Basic things. Do you know your faces and formations?
[23:29:47] CCA.C17-RCT.27081: Affirmative
[23:29:50] CCA.C17-RCT.95737: /looc Bit rusty tbh
[23:29:56] UU-SeC.17: Let's give them a try.
[23:29:58] UU-SeC.17: About face.
[23:30:13] CCA.C17-RCT.95737: I never learned such things.
[23:30:26] UU-SeC.17: They tell you where to face.
[23:30:48] UU-SeC.17: About face means turn around on your right shoulder.
[23:30:54] UU-SeC.17: Right face you turn to the right.
[23:31:01] UU-SeC.17: Left face is self explanatory.
[23:31:07] UU-SeC.17: Front face means you face the instructor.
[23:31:12] UU-SeC.17: Also turn over your right shoulder.
[23:31:16] UU-SeC.17: Ready to practice?
[23:31:27] CCA.C17-RCT.95737: Ready as i'll ever be

[23:32:39] UU-SeC.17: About face.
[23:32:56] UU-SeC.17: No. About face means you turn around, no matter what direction your facing.
[23:33:07] UU-SeC.17: If you're facing left, you turn to face the right.
[23:33:12] UU-SeC.17: If you're facing forward, you turn to face behind.
[23:33:13] UU-SeC.17: Good.
[23:33:13] CCA.C17-RCT.95737: I-I see
[23:33:20] UU-SeC.17: Front face.

[23:33:31] UU-SeC.17: Turn to your right.
[23:33:38] UU-SeC.17: With front face and about face, you turn to your right.
[23:33:46] UU-SeC.17: make sense?
[23:33:56] CCA.C17-RCT.95737: It'll take some getting used to.
[23:34:02] CCA.C17-RCT.95737: Muscle memory and all.
[23:34:05] UU-SeC.17: You're recruits.
[23:34:10] UU-SeC.17: You'll learn.
[23:34:15] UU-SeC.17: Front face.

[23:35:39] UU-SeC.17: When you're doing left face, you can turn to the left
[23:35:44] CCA.C17-RCT.95737: /looc Nah it's just people don't know when to leave me the fuck alone 
[23:35:55] UU-SeC.17: It's only when doing front and about that you *have* to turn on your right.
[23:35:59] UU-SeC.17: Front face.
[23:36:05] UU-SeC.17: Left face.
[23:36:19] UU-SeC.17: Let's try that again.
[23:36:20] UU-SeC.17: Front face.
[23:36:28] UU-SeC.17: Left face.
[23:36:34] UU-SeC.17: Good.

[23:37:09] CCA.C17-RCT.95737: /looc What's the command for third?
[23:37:18] CCA.C17-RCT.27081: /looc just go to tab
[23:37:18] UU-SeC.17: .//just go to the context menu and enable simple third person
[23:37:26] CCA.C17-RCT.27081: /looc i use it from tab

[23:37:50] UU-SeC.17: Alright.
[23:37:56] UU-SeC.17: Some of these are self explanatory.
[23:37:59] UU-SeC.17: Try to figure it out.
[23:38:02] UU-SeC.17: If you can't, then I'll explain.
[23:38:06] UU-SeC.17: .//third person is great for this
[23:38:16] UU-SeC.17: /y Single column!
[23:38:21] UU-SeC.17: Good.
[23:38:23] UU-SeC.17: Double column!
[23:38:38] UU-SeC.17: double column, it's two lines. The CO is on the Left.
[23:38:55] UU-SeC.17: I need someone  behind me.
[23:38:59] UU-SeC.17: Great.
[23:39:04] UU-SeC.17: Now you move back.
[23:39:09] UU-SeC.17: Nobody is next to the Co.
[23:39:11] UU-SeC.17: .//co.*
[23:39:25] UU-SeC.17: Get it? Two lines, the CO is at the front, nobody next to him. Then two parallel lines.
[23:39:31] UU-SeC.17: Wedge.
[23:39:39] UU-SeC.17: Tight wedge.
[23:40:02] UU-SeC.17: Good. Make sure you're in line with each other. That's more muscle memory and repetition.
[23:40:12] UU-SeC.17: Loose wedge.
[23:40:25] UU-SeC.17: 270.
[23:40:29] UU-SeC.17: Move to your right a bit.
[23:40:37] UU-SeC.17: No, your right.
[23:40:51] UU-SeC.17: .//it seems i'm retarded

[23:41:07] UU-SeC.17: Prisoner diamond on me.
[23:41:11] UU-SeC.17: The best of your ability of course.
[23:41:15] UU-SeC.17: We're missing two people but try your best.
[23:41:30] UU-SeC.17: Prisoner diamonds face inwards, guns out, pointed at the target's legs.
[23:41:45] UU-SeC.17: What you were doing is a VIP diamond.
[23:41:50] CCA.C17-RCT.95737: Ah.
[23:41:55] UU-SeC.17: So, VIP diamond.
[23:42:03] UU-SeC.17: /y LEFT FACE!
[23:42:10] UU-SeC.17: Good.
[23:42:16] UU-SeC.17: Alright. Firing line.
[23:42:20] UU-SeC.17: Great.
[23:42:25] UU-SeC.17: Now, for the one that people always fuck up.
[23:42:28] UU-SeC.17: Advanced firing line.
[23:42:45] UU-SeC.17: Advanced firing line is similar but with another row.
[23:42:50] UU-SeC.17: A front row and a back row.
[23:42:54] UU-SeC.17: the CO is in the center of the back row.
[23:43:03] UU-SeC.17: 270.
[23:43:05] UU-SeC.17: Directly to my side.
[23:43:14] UU-SeC.17: Directly next to me. Don't be afraid.
[23:43:16] UU-SeC.17: I probably don't bite.
[23:43:22] CCA.C17-RCT.95737: /me Chuckles
[23:43:23] UU-SeC.17: 957, in front of me.
[23:43:30] CCA.C17-RCT.27081: /looc man i would do the haha voice command rn
[23:43:32] UU-SeC.17: Move back.
[23:43:39] UU-SeC.17: No, like.
[23:43:41] UU-SeC.17: Move backwards.
[23:43:43] UU-SeC.17: Still be in front of me.
[23:43:49] UU-SeC.17: Crouch.
[23:43:53] UU-SeC.17: Great.
[23:44:03] UU-SeC.17: Staggered column.
[23:44:09] UU-SeC.17: This one is weird, I'll give you that.
[23:44:23] UU-SeC.17: So here's how it works. Two lines, spaced out. So for this to work.
[23:44:28] UU-SeC.17: You.
[23:44:30] UU-SeC.17: 957.
[23:44:39] UU-SeC.17: Would be behind me, but leave a space as if there's an invisible guy behind me.
[23:44:47] UU-SeC.17: Great.
[23:44:55] UU-SeC.17: Then you, 270.
[23:45:01] UU-SeC.17: Go in that invisible person's space.
[23:45:11] UU-SeC.17: Now move to the right.
[23:45:22] UU-SeC.17: Further, as if there's a whole invisible column.
[23:45:34] UU-SeC.17: Great. Now loosen up my row.
[23:45:39] UU-SeC.17: /y perfect!
[23:45:43] UU-SeC.17: /y Alright.
[23:45:48] UU-SeC.17: /y This one isn't well known.

[23:46:50] UU-SeC.17: That's right.
[23:46:53] UU-SeC.17: Right echelon.
[23:47:06] UU-SeC.17: Great.
[23:47:10] UU-SeC.17: Got it?
[23:47:15] CCA.C17-RCT.27081: 10-4
[23:47:21] UU-SeC.17: Questions from the peanut gallery?
[23:47:30] CCA.C17-RCT.27081: Negative
[23:47:31] UU-SeC.17: Good.
[23:47:36] UU-SeC.17: Next up is breaching.
[23:47:41] UU-SeC.17: God help us all.
[23:47:53] UU-SeC.17: There are two "lines" in breaching.
[23:47:58] UU-SeC.17: There's the breacher's line, which is one person
[23:48:06] UU-SeC.17: Then the injection line.
[23:48:09] UU-SeC.17: It has everyone else.
[23:48:12] UU-SeC.17: So say I'm the breacher.
[23:48:34] UU-SeC.17: /y Breacher is always opposite the doorknob!
[23:48:43] UU-SeC.17: 270, you get behind the other one.
[23:48:49] UU-SeC.17: 957, move it up.
[23:48:58] UU-SeC.17: 270, move it up as well.
[23:49:04] UU-SeC.17: /toggleraise
[23:49:06] UU-SeC.17: Alright.
[23:49:10] UU-SeC.17: There are four commands.
[23:49:10] UU-SeC.17: /toggleraise
[23:49:12] UU-SeC.17: /y Stack!
[23:49:16] UU-SeC.17: Stack is what we just did.
[23:49:19] UU-SeC.17: We get into breaching positions.
[23:49:31] UU-SeC.17: /y Prep!
[23:49:36] UU-SeC.17: That's when you unsafety your weapons.
[23:49:36] UU-SeC.17: /toggleraise
[23:49:38] UU-SeC.17: /y lock
[23:49:43] UU-SeC.17: That's when you shoot the lock.
[23:49:45] UU-SeC.17: /y inject
[23:50:01] UU-SeC.17: That's when you actually go in. But the order is different from what you'd think. First of the injection line goes in.
[23:50:05] UU-SeC.17: Then the breacher goes in.
[23:50:10] UU-SeC.17: Then the rest of the injection line.
[23:50:16] CCA.C17-RCT.95737: Noted.
[23:50:17] UU-SeC.17: So let's do a quick run.
[23:50:19] UU-SeC.17: /toggleraise
[23:50:21] CCA.C17-RCT.27081: affirmative
[23:50:22] UU-SeC.17: Get out of formation.
[23:50:30] UU-SeC.17: Alright, and front face.
[23:50:37] UU-SeC.17: VIP wedge on me.
[23:50:59] UU-SeC.17: VIP wedge you surround in a square.
[23:51:04] UU-SeC.17: And face away from the VIP.
[23:51:10] UU-SeC.17: I would be the VIP.
[23:51:17] UU-SeC.17: So 957. Face exactly away from me.
[23:51:23] UU-SeC.17: Perfect.
[23:51:34] UU-SeC.17: Now I'm the breacher for this example.
[23:51:36] UU-SeC.17: /y Stack!
[23:51:45] UU-SeC.17: /y prep!

[23:51:53] UU-SeC.17: /toggleraise
[23:52:15] CCA.C17-RCT.95737: /looc Seems that we got stuck on each other :^)
[23:52:15] UU-SeC.17: Remember. It starts with the first of the injection line. Then the breacher goes.
[23:52:22] UU-SeC.17: THEN the rest of the injection line.
[23:52:25] UU-SeC.17: Try it again.
[23:52:56] UU-SeC.17: Take these.
[23:53:32] UU-SeC.17: Take your ammunition and load it.
[23:53:45] UU-SeC.17: Trigger discipline. Keep your gun in safety unless you intend to shoot.
[23:53:51] UU-SeC.17: Alriht.
[23:53:53] UU-SeC.17: I'm the breacher again.

[23:54:35] UU-SeC.17: Heads it is.

[23:54:50] UU-SeC.17: Alright, you're the breacher.
[23:54:54] UU-SeC.17: You give the commands
[23:55:09] UU-SeC.17: We start with Stack. Go from there.

[23:56:42] CCA.C17-RCT.27081: Yes.
[23:56:48] CCA.C17-RCT.95737: Yessir 
[23:56:53] UU-SeC.17: Normally the biggest gun is the first injector.
[23:57:19] UU-SeC.17: The CO normally ends up being the breacher because they give the commands anyways.
[23:57:28] CCA.C17-RCT.95737: Right.
[23:57:28] UU-SeC.17: Alright.
[23:57:37] UU-SeC.17: Let's go over everyone's favorite boring shit.

[23:58:33] UU-SeC.17: Alright, name a piece of contraband.
[23:58:35] UU-SeC.17: Or any object.
