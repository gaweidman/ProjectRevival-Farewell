[16:04:50] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: What are the components or materials of your ballistic vest?
[16:05:01] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: You should know this, i5.
[16:05:15] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: Is it a pre-war vest retrieved for use was my question originally.
[16:05:23] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: I just made it simpler, my dear sir.
[16:05:26] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: Sixty
[16:05:28] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: Nine
[16:05:29] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: No, it's a UU-Made vest.
[16:05:30] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: haha
[16:05:35] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: So it's pretty much human standardized.
[16:05:41] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: Four
[16:05:44] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: Twenty
[16:05:46] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: Haha
[16:05:48] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Correct.
[16:05:59] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: A 1 inch ceramic plating as well as AR-500 steel or another variant of hardened steel for shrapnel absorption.
[16:06:11] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: Those do deteriorate rapidly, even from a .22 bullet.
[16:06:15] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: Hey what are you selling?
[16:06:29] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Correct.
[16:06:31] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: /me points at the strange, black yet ceramic-looking plating welded or something to some steel plating on the table.
[16:06:51] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: I've made some research on materials that were used as prototypes prewar.
[16:06:58] Jackson H. Lycan: Uh,
[16:07:04] Jackson H. Lycan: I'm making a list right now.
[16:07:07] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: Alright.
[16:07:08] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: I found out a brittle, yet extremely energy tolerant material named as chrome carbide.
[16:07:20] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: /me points at two appearingly bullet strike markings on the plating.
[16:07:24] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Chromium two carbide.
[16:07:29] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Proceed.
[16:07:37] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: /it They are literally just damages that wiped off the coloring and polishing on the surface. No feelable dents or scratches.
[16:08:02] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: I believe this material, combined with AR-500 or AR-550 steel can be an extremely reliable replacement for the standardized junk you are wearing.
[16:08:05] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: With all due respect, sir.
[16:08:29] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Ah, well when you add "all due respect", you can say anything disrespectful.
[16:08:34] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: Haha
[16:08:36] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: Interesting stuff right there, what is it?
[16:08:39] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Your mother's a fat ugly whore. All due respect, of course.
[16:08:47] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: The dark humor aside,
[16:08:52] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: Do you have a high caliber firearm on you?
[16:09:13] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: I've got my 357.

[16:10:12] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: A meter distance would suffice.

[16:10:19] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: I guarantee the bullet will break.

[16:11:01] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: Interesting.
[16:11:09] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Indeed.
[16:11:16] Jackson H. Lycan: /looc ok can you make it like an actual paper please?
[16:11:17] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: Shotgun?
[16:11:24] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: A long barrel rifle?
[16:11:39] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: I've got a shotgun slung here but I'd rather not fire it here.
[16:11:46] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: I get your point.

[16:12:34] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: Should I offer it to the inspection of the sectorial or something?
[16:12:38] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: It's quite a piece of work.
[16:12:47] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: I have far more ideas in my mind, sir.
[16:12:47] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: I am absolutely going to show it to the sectorial.
[16:13:00] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: I just need the go mark from an officer to be able to begin my projects.
[16:13:26] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: Planning to re-circuit stunsticks, perhaps use better quality alloys and such in the transformers within.
[16:13:32] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: Amp up that current and voltage ratio.
[16:13:44] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: What's wrong with the stunsticks we have now?

[16:21:38] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: /me removes four security links before proceeding. He quickly breaks the soldering points of any cables to circuitry and components.
[16:21:53] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: /me removes the regulator as well as transformer from the stunstick before gaining visual of the capacitors.
[16:22:05] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: There you are, rat...
[16:22:06] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: If its anything I got a notepad.

[16:22:20] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: Alright.
[16:22:25] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: /me grabs very small pincers, and carefully extracts the capacitors, assuming they are holding a load for work safety.
[16:22:26] Jackson H. Lycan: You know how to get a pin though?
[16:22:33] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: Unfortunatly not.
[16:22:36] Jackson H. Lycan: Damn

[16:24:58] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: I hope there are better quality ones of these transformers and the regulator.

[16:50:38] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: I completely re-designed the shaft as well as the circuitry for a better energy output as well as less harm to the enforcing unit's hands.
[16:50:43] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Better to use materials on something that works than improving something that doesn't need fixed.
[16:50:52] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Less... harm?
[16:50:52] CCA.C17-HELIX.i5.50299: From what I see it just uses more materials.

[16:51:17] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: It actually uses less materials. The batons we currently use possess two different parts rather than one.
[16:51:23] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: It's longer.
[16:51:38] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: You said it's.. what? Fifteen percent longer?
[16:51:46] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: I didn't comment on it's length.
[16:51:58] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.76063 [X]: And it is longer because it is a prototype and is awaiting feedback for improvements on design.
