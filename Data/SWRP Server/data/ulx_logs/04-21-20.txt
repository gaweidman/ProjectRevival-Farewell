[23:08:42] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //but you get what i mean
[23:09:22] Ollie Garner: // Yeah. How serious is this server by the way? In terms of RP. Like, if I wanted to shoot at a rebel, would I have to exclaim it or some shit. I've seen... servers that do that.
[23:09:50] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //Well we try to be a bit different. I wouldn't call us extreme hardasses but I wouldn't go as far as calling it semi-serious either. Somewhere in-between.
[23:10:41] Ollie Garner: // I see. I don't mind having to do things such as FearRP, PainRP, etc etc. 
[23:11:01] Ollie Garner: // But some servers take it way too seriously. 
[23:11:28] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //Yeah, we do subscribe to those,  but also try to make sure it's not painfully boring. Like you get shot in your chest and you have to agonizingly roleplay exactly how you writhe on the ground in agony in a minimum of 500 words
[23:11:41] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //we don't go that far
[23:12:06] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //but conversely we don't just let you break both your legs and go "owie"
[23:12:25] Ollie Garner: // Yeah. Personally, I always enjoyed RP with mechanics in it. Not just text based with a screen of two characters staring at each other
[23:12:32] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //yeah honestly

[23:18:05] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //it really has to do with prior experience that we've noticed as staff

[23:18:50] Ollie Garner: // Nice. When it comes to CPs, are you strict about knowing radio codes? I've gotten nearly demoted, which caused me to leave the server, because I forgot a few radio codes.
[23:19:12] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //no, not atall. we have maybe a handfull that we expect you to know
[23:19:18] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //like 10-8 or 10-99
[23:19:23] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //handful*
[23:19:26] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //that's really it
[23:19:41] Ollie Garner: // Okay. I can remember shit like that, but some shit is just too much. I didn't join CP to actually become a officer in real life
[23:19:46] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //if i'm being honest, I forget a lot of them half the time. I normally have to look them up when i use them
[23:19:51] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //exactly
[23:19:57] Ollie Garner: // Oof. 
[23:20:20] Ollie Garner: // Ngl, I honestly tend to find it faster for me to just type the actual situation and not use codes
[23:20:50] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //Yeah, at least that way you don't have to keep combing through your memory?
[23:20:54] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //memory.*
[23:20:59] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192<STEAM_0:1:53097688> used the tool permaprops on maps/rp_industrial17_v1.bsp
[23:21:29] Ollie Garner: // Yeah. Are CP divisions something you perm stay in? A server I am maining right now allows you to switch Divisions when you need to cover a job. Don't have a JURY? Switch division.
[23:23:19] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //We're not huge on it, but if you're lower-ranked it shouldn't be as much of a problem. Part of that is that we make other units fill other roles if we have to. 
[23:23:46] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //so if there are no GRIDs online and a machine is broken, they either say "fuck it, who here knows the most about engineering", or just try to find another way to do what they're doing
[23:23:52] Ollie Garner: // Okay, cool. I tend to main HELIX, but I like to be versatile and switch to a diffrent division depending on the situation.
[23:24:09] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //alright
[23:24:30] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //yeah, if there aren't other divisions, you can just fill in to the best of your ability
[23:24:36] Ollie Garner: // Aight.
[23:25:49] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //also i just want ot disclaim real quick that some servers have a sort of pro-faction leaning
[23:25:57] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //but we don't really have that
[23:26:01] Ollie Garner: // Okay.
[23:26:10] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //as long as roleplay is happening and it's good, we're fine
[23:26:22] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //unless you try to say "hmm today i will raid the nexus"
[23:26:40] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //that sort of thing, then it's obviously a bit differnt
[23:26:44] Ollie Garner: // Yeah.
[23:26:57] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //i'm trying to think of anything else you might need to know
[23:27:02] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //nothing is really coming to mind
[23:27:38] Ollie Garner: // Alrighty
[23:27:46] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.69192: //except for, yeah, we're still adding things regularly, so even if you're not happy with absolutely everything we have to offer, chances are you can suggest it and we'll implement it
