[00:54:55] OTA.AEX-ECHO.OfC.02932: What's strange is they had no goal, other than killing soldiers.

[00:56:10] OTA.C17-KING.i3.50919: Perhaps they think by killing the soldiers, that the program will be halted. That is, if they know of the program in the first place.

[14:16:51] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.83467: Not really, but it's a USP.
[14:16:54] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.83467: Everyone gets one.
[14:17:02] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.83467: It'd be on me if it doesn't work.

[14:23:00] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: I think I'm thoroughly confused.
[14:23:04] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.83467: Why so?
[14:23:16] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Explain to me what you made.
[14:23:22] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.83467: Oh, of course.
[14:23:47] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.83467: I've wrapped some shrapnel around the top part, so you don't need to turn the stick on for a real beating.
[14:24:07] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.83467: Around the handle is a black adhesive wrap, sticky on both sides. This is so that nobody yanks the stick out of your hands.
[14:24:32] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: You put.. shrapnel. On a stunstick.
[14:24:38] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.83467: Uh, yeah.
[14:24:42] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.83467: Why? That a problem?
[14:24:46] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Very much so.
[14:24:50] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Shrapnel will make them bleed.
[14:24:55] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: That's where we're gonna have to draw the line.
[14:24:59] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.83467: Yeah, I dunno.
[14:25:04] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: I appreciate the effort.
[14:25:07] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.83467: No problem
[14:25:11] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: But.
[14:25:19] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.83467: If you have an idea, I'll be glad to help you work on it.
[14:25:26] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Shrapnel on the business end isn't the best idea.
[14:25:33] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.83467: Nice SPAS, by the way.
[14:25:33] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: I can't say I do.
[14:25:39] CCA.C17-GRID.i4.83467: Can I keep the adhesive part though?
[14:25:40] CCA.C17-GRID.EpU.04182: Oh, thanks. EpU is a good rank.
