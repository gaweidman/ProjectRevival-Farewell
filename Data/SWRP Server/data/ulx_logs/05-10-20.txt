[00:54:25] Ethan King: // Also by the way that would be the biggest waste of ammo ever devised by man.
[00:54:26] Joseph Kimsler: //no you can go out
[00:54:28] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: // Yeah, I guess
[00:54:43] Joseph Kimsler: //yeah, vvhy enslave a vortigaunt and make everyone want you dead

[00:55:04] Joseph Kimsler: //vortigaunts*
[00:55:04] Le'Kurl: // as vorg
[00:55:08] Le'Kurl: // so what do i do
[00:55:09] Le'Kurl: // as vorg
[00:55:09] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: // Only reason Rebels and Vorts team up is because the rebels helped them out of slavery
[00:55:10] Joseph Kimsler: //bruh

[00:55:19] Le'Kurl: // bro okay
[00:55:34] Joseph Kimsler: //i thought it was also because the vorts see the humans as agreeable

[00:55:42] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: // Maybe.

[00:55:50] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698<STEAM_0:1:52892973> changed their name to Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple
[00:55:59] Joseph Kimsler: //the rebels want freedom, the vortigaunts know what being indentured is like
[00:56:07] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: // Yeah
[00:56:19] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: // It was also a human who freed them from the Nihlanth at firsty
[00:56:24] Joseph Kimsler: //yeah
[00:56:33] Joseph Kimsler: //that too
[00:56:37] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: Oh, it's you.
[00:56:41] Ethan King: Ahh, Watcher.
[00:56:41] Joseph Kimsler: //so their first contact wasn't awful
[00:56:50] Joseph Kimsler: //i wonder if you could make a peeper puppy a pet
[00:56:51] Joseph Kimsler: //like
[00:56:54] Ethan King: You look like your in one piece.
[00:56:55] Joseph Kimsler: //not nice
[00:57:05] Joseph Kimsler: //but in the way you could make a bear a pet
[00:57:09] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: Yeah. I think I passed out earlier due to being tired as hell.
[00:57:26] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: // I mean, Houndeyes do have dog like behaviour. A pack mentality.
[00:57:39] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: // So it theoretically is possible.
[00:57:44] Ethan King: I've attempted to break into that bunker using my pickaxe, It didn't seem to work.
[00:57:59] Joseph Kimsler: //yeah
[00:58:03] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: Damn. Might be something we have to chip at every now and again.
[00:58:14] Joseph Kimsler: //that's what makes me think it. i wonder if after enough years of grooming
[00:58:18] Joseph Kimsler: //you could domesticate them like dogs
[00:58:28] Ethan King: Who knows, But at some point we might have to switch to explosives.
[00:58:45] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: Yeah. I do want to find a set of tools. I'm hoping it would be possible to dismantle the door
[00:58:48] Le'Kurl: // i feel like a asshole
[00:58:51] Le'Kurl: // rn
[00:58:54] Joseph Kimsler: //why
[00:59:10] Joseph Kimsler: //because you want slaves?
[00:59:24] Ethan King: Oh yes I forgot to ask you, When Watcher three and me (Also some other rebels) agreed to help each other he mentioned old base he had.
[00:59:27] Le'Kurl: // i was dming a friends arguing then he told me to shut up and he was going thru hard times because his mom died and i was complaining to him
[00:59:31] Ethan King: Do you know anything about this?
[00:59:39] Le'Kurl: // i feel so bad
[00:59:40] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: Oh? Uh, no?
[00:59:42] Joseph Kimsler: //you can apologize
[00:59:42] Le'Kurl: // i didnt know

[01:00:13] Joseph Kimsler: //eli... vance?
[01:00:14] Marc 'Watcher 4' Temple: Alright. It might've been what I showed you earlier.
[01:00:16] Joseph Kimsler: //yeah no
[01:00:16] Le'Kurl: // yes
[01:00:21] Le'Kurl: // why not
[01:00:21] Ethan King: I see.
[01:00:26] Joseph Kimsler: //because
[01:00:28] Joseph Kimsler: //he has no business here
[01:00:34] Joseph Kimsler: //he doesn't know you assholes exist
[01:00:35] Le'Kurl: // can i be alyx
[01:00:36] Joseph Kimsler: //no offense
[01:00:40] Joseph Kimsler: //he only knows franz and jamal
[01:00:41] Ethan King: Then that gives me more motivation to crack it open.
[01:00:46] Joseph Kimsler: //and he never met them in person
[01:00:47] Le'Kurl: // he knows willam
[01:00:47] Joseph Kimsler: //also no

[01:01:15] Joseph Kimsler: //no
[01:01:18] Le'Kurl: // ya
[01:01:20] Joseph Kimsler: //i hate admin rebel characters
[01:01:24] Le'Kurl: // why
[01:01:40] Joseph Kimsler: //most admikn rebel characters are just admins being edgy under the protection of a staff position
[01:01:51] Joseph Kimsler: //spawning themself things because of an asspulled story
[01:01:54] Le'Kurl: // well you dont have to be that
[01:01:59] Le'Kurl: // you can make story

[01:02:20] Joseph Kimsler: //i mean i have self control

[01:02:31] Joseph Kimsler: //but it gives off bad impressions to people who join

[01:02:39] Le'Kurl: // ya you right

[01:02:47] Joseph Kimsler: //that's kinda the only reason i had gabe hill

[03:29:59] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: Citizens would be intended to mix the two, supplements and food.
[03:30:16] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: Interesting. Makes me wonder if CWUs are gonna start selling these at stores or some crap.
[03:30:16] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: But there's a bunch of disagreement about new packaging for rations and all that.
[03:30:32] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: They could, but I doubt it. Citizens would rather have their UU-Brand crap.
[03:30:41] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: Yeah.
[03:30:52] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: If they wanted the standard slop we'd have to investigate that.
[03:30:57] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: Because I remember being a citizen.

[03:31:13] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: Not to sound unloyal. I got memory replacement.
[03:31:19] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: Same.

[03:31:54] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: Eh. I guess memory replacement goes different for everyone.
[03:31:58] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: Yeah, maybe.

[03:33:12] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: It's a reward given out to units where they can keep certain memories of their family before the war.
[03:33:27] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: Ah. I see.
[03:33:30] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: They say it keeps 'em motivated. Personally, I don't see the use. The memories are already gone, why should I care?

[03:33:50] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: Ah. I guess. All I remember of my civi life was how... mundane it was.
[03:34:14] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: Yeah, it wasn't the most interesting. Then I remember getting loyalist status and it was alright.

[03:35:28] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: They might do a work cycle of printing them.
[03:35:35] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: Yeah.
[03:35:38] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: I'll bring that up to the officers.
[03:35:50] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: Alright.
[03:35:57] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: Plus, this whole ration remake thing.
[03:36:14] CCA.C08-GRID.i4.69192: It gives citizens more opportunities for work cycles.
[03:36:20] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: Yeah, it does.

[03:40:48] CCA.C08-UNION.i4.33698: Huh. Honestly, funny thing. I had no idea what cigs are until I read up on the hazards of it accidentally in a book.
