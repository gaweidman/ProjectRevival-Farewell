[22:06:15] TNK Private First Class Mitchell Lazarus: Yeah, probably just a mirage.
[22:06:39] Major General Jacob Dubreas: There were eight ships, all of unknown make. We didn't get too good of a look at them before we started taking them down, so we can't say for sure.
[22:07:01] Flight Crewman Third Class Dash Rene: So what are we exactly looking for then?
[22:07:03] Major General Jacob Dubreas: Two of them were landers, armored heavily.
[22:07:23] Major General Jacob Dubreas: One of them made it here, the other was shot down.
[22:07:29] Major General Jacob Dubreas: They forced a landing here and unloaded 50 men
[22:07:38] Major General Jacob Dubreas: 5 of them carrying heavy repeating blasters.
[22:07:42] Major General Jacob Dubreas: They seemed to know where to target.
[22:07:48] Major General Jacob Dubreas: They came this way...
[22:07:53] Major General Jacob Dubreas: To that building.
[22:07:59] Major General Jacob Dubreas: See, with the antennas?
[22:08:03] TNK Private First Class Mitchell Lazarus: Yep
[22:08:33] Flight Crewman Third Class Dash Rene: .// should make a squad 
[22:08:39] Flight Petty Officer Third Class John Tzar: yes, sir
[22:08:42] Major General Jacob Dubreas: They're in such bad shape because of them launching a siege on them and the building.
[22:09:01] Major General Jacob Dubreas: They entered and planted thermal detonators on our terminals, so we couldn't call for help as easily.
[22:09:01] Major General Jacob Dubreas: /toggleraise
[22:09:17] Major General Jacob Dubreas: Likely to buy tim,e.
[22:09:47] Major General Jacob Dubreas: They had a demolitionist, and they fired a surface to air rocket at one of our anti-aircraft turrets.
[22:09:48] Flight Crewman Third Class Dash Rene: // Dash rene "wait you can buy time? How much????"
[22:09:50] Major General Jacob Dubreas: Located..
[22:09:57] Major General Jacob Dubreas: On that building.[
[22:10:07] Flight Crewman Third Class Dash Rene: The one with the weird logo?
[22:10:28] Major General Jacob Dubreas: Then they got back in their lander and flew towards our mining complex.
[22:11:27] Major General Jacob Dubreas: From there, they killed all the personnel in their way and stole about 3 metric tons of beskar, 2 tons of processed durasteel, and 4 tons of various other metla.s
[22:11:41] Flight Crewman Third Class Dash Rene: Holy shit
[22:11:43] Flight Crewman Third Class Dash Rene: 2 tons?
[22:11:48] Flight Petty Officer Third Class John Tzar: three metric tons of beskar?
[22:11:52] TNK Private First Class Mitchell Lazarus: 3 tons of beskar?
[22:11:56] TNK Private First Class Mitchell Lazarus: Holy hell
[22:11:59] Flight Crewman Third Class Dash Rene: Jesus christ
[22:12:01] Flight Petty Officer Third Class John Tzar: good god
[22:12:10] Major General Jacob Dubreas: Yes, stored in different places. Keep in mind that 1 ton is not much in the context of manufacturing.
[22:12:21] TNK Private First Class Mitchell Lazarus: Still thats a shit ton
[22:12:25] Major General Jacob Dubreas: No, absolutely.
[22:12:30] Major General Jacob Dubreas: Far more than we want in the hands of an enemy/
[22:12:44] Flight Crewman Third Class Dash Rene: They can make powerful armor with that
[22:12:51] TNK Private First Class Mitchell Lazarus: Yeah, we got that part Dash.
[22:12:56] Flight Crewman Third Class Dash Rene: .// i will shit yourself
[22:13:02] TNK Private First Class Mitchell Lazarus: .// Okay
[22:13:27] Major General Jacob Dubreas: Cargo reinforcements came for them, and as our foot reinforcements recounted, they split the loot onto different ships.
[22:14:13] Major General Jacob Dubreas: They took off, and we managed to take down a few ships. We reclaimed a ton of beskar, a half ton of copper, and a ton of durasteel.
[22:14:36] Major General Jacob Dubreas: As you can imagine, the beskar was not harmed in the plummet down.
[22:14:57] Major General Jacob Dubreas: No group has contacted us for a ransom.
[22:15:08] Major General Jacob Dubreas: //brb
[22:16:53] Major General Jacob Dubreas: //okay back

[22:19:46] Major General Jacob Dubreas: You just kinda did.
[22:19:49] Major General Jacob Dubreas: Right.

[22:20:11] Flight Petty Officer Third Class John Tzar: kick Dash Rene out of it
[22:20:29] TNK Private First Class Mitchell Lazarus: I would agree but at the moment we need to focus on the objective.

[22:25:28] Flight Crewman Third Class Dash Rene: bravo
[22:25:29] TNK Private First Class Mitchell Lazarus: Fair enough
[22:25:37] Major General Jacob Dubreas: High mobility clothes, pouches full of ammunition.
[22:25:41] Flight Petty Officer Third Class John Tzar: hmm.
[22:25:52] Major General Jacob Dubreas: These aren't just meant to look scary.
[22:25:55] Major General Jacob Dubreas: In fact, they don't.
[22:26:02] Major General Jacob Dubreas: So I'd like to doubt pirates.
[22:26:06] TNK Private First Class Mitchell Lazarus: Hm.....perhaps they are a highly trained militia?
[22:26:11] Major General Jacob Dubreas: Very possibly.
[22:26:23] TNK Private First Class Mitchell Lazarus: Only some people with real knowledge on military tactics could pull something like this off.
[22:26:30] TNK Private First Class Mitchell Lazarus: Not some ragtag group.

[22:27:52] Major General Jacob Dubreas: Compact, modular.
[22:27:53] Flight Petty Officer Third Class John Tzar: A relby V10 is a semi auto rifle. Can be super lethal in the hands of skilled marksmen. I know that bounty hunters like them.
[22:28:08] Major General Jacob Dubreas: right.
[22:28:17] Major General Jacob Dubreas: So we can conclude these people know what they're doing.
[22:28:33] Flight Petty Officer Third Class John Tzar: perhaps this man was some sort of recon or scout? Light clothing, marksman rifle, lots of ammunition. It lines up to me.
[22:28:37] Flight Petty Officer Third Class John Tzar: er.
