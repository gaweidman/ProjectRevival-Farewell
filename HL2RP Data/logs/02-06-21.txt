[16:46:30]	[OOC] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.41034: i remember it was the first map tho
[16:46:46]	[OOC] Morgan Beck: Because there's like, only a few beta RP maps for HL2RP to my knowledge.
[16:47:09]	[OOC] Morgan Beck: And objectively, this one is probably the best out of them.
[16:47:19]	[OOC] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.41034: oh, beta?
[16:47:31]	[OOC] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.41034: screw beta :/

[16:47:47]	[OOC] CCA.C17-GRID.i5.41034: so only beta forever now?
[16:47:47]	[OOC] Morgan Beck: It's been incredibly good for server growth. So we're perm staying on it.
[16:47:55]	[OOC] Morgan Beck: Yeah.

[16:48:52]	[OOC] Morgan Beck: I dunno, I've been enjoying it a bit more than I thought it would. I personally hate this map, and hate the parts of the beta that are being edgy for the sake of being edgy.
