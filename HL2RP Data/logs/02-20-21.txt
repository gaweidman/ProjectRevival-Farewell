[23:37:18]	[Y] CPT Nathan Vance: Again, like most other aliens, they are not dangerous on their own, but in large groups, they can easily take out at least two men.
[23:37:33]	[Y] CPT Nathan Vance: Then, antlions.
[23:37:58]	[Y] CPT Nathan Vance: They have no official name at the moment, but they are the most dangerous xenobe you will ever find.
[23:38:11]	[Y] CPT Nathan Vance: They populate shell beach, and they can only be killed by sinking ammunition into them.
[23:38:16]	[Y] CPT Nathan Vance: I do in fact mean sinking.
