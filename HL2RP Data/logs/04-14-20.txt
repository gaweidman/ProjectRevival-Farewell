[00:20:18]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: genuinely a shitty framework
[00:20:21]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: made by shittier people
[00:20:37]	[OOC] Steven Walker: I booted this framework up for the first time and was pretty shocked on how smooth it feels
[00:20:41]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: yeah
[00:20:42]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: so
[00:20:45]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: recently
[00:20:48]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: not sure how recent
[00:20:58]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: nebulous gets so big that they do the TnB thing and make their own gamemode
[00:21:05]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: so here's what nebulous did right
[00:21:11]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: they took nutscript 1.1
[00:21:19]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: find and replace nut with ix
[00:21:20]	[OOC] Steven Walker: I had several whitelists on neb back in the day ;-;
[00:21:34]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: added some visual stuff to improve it
[00:21:37]	[OOC] Steven Walker: No shit?
[00:21:39]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: fixed a few small things and fixed it
[00:21:45]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: then released it
[00:22:09]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: so basically they reskinned nutscript with minor fixes
[00:22:18]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: called it helix
[00:22:26]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: and now it's the biggest framework
[00:22:44]	[OOC] Steven Walker: And somehow it's already 100x better than clockwork could ever be.
[00:22:54]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: well yeah because nutscript is different from clockwork
[00:22:55]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: in that
[00:22:56]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: it's good
[00:23:09]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: and then clockwork finally pulled the plug on its drm
[00:23:09]	Gabe Hill used command '/DoorSetHidden true'.
[00:23:11]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: uh
[00:23:14]	[OOC] Steven Walker: Still can't get over how smooth this feels.

[00:23:22]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: yeah, it's really pretty to look at
[00:23:26]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: it handles well
[00:23:42]	[OOC] Steven Walker: How are the plugins doing?
[00:23:55]	[OOC] Steven Walker: Are people working on converting it for the new framework or?
[00:24:21]	[OOC] Steven Walker: Or has the entire library been dumpstered 
[00:24:42]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: they have a conversion guide for converting clockwork shit into helixc
[00:24:46]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: idk how good it is
[00:24:51]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: my guess is dogshit
[00:24:53]	[OOC] Gabe Hill: but idfk
