[10:15:15]	[IT] Zandrew Bennet: In his crusade, the secretive admins bestowed upon him terrible power and speed, and with his might he crushed the obsidian pillars of the Nutscript Temples.
[10:15:32]	[LOOC] Mitchell Lazarus: The Mingeslayer
[10:15:34]	[IT] Zandrew Bennet: He set forth without pity upon the players of the countless gamemodes. Unbreakable, incorrutible, unyielding, the Rat sought to end the dominion of the Dark Realm.
[10:15:44]	[IT] Zandrew Bennet: Tempered by the fires of roleplay, his iron will remained steadfast through the servers that prey upon the weak.
[10:15:56]	[IT] Zandrew Bennet:  For he alone was the Mingelord, the Unchained Roleplayer, who sought retribution in all servers, toxic and quality, veterans and minges, in the beginning, and the end.
[10:16:06]	[IT] Zandrew Bennet: And he hunted the slaves of Roleplay with barbarous cruelty; for he passed through the divide as none but ERPers had before.
[10:16:18]	[IT] Zandrew Bennet: In the first age, in the first server, when the gamemodes first strengthened, one stood. Burned by the embers of the schema, his soul blistered by the fires of Erotic Roleplay and tainted beyond ascension, he chose the path of perpetual torment.
[10:16:26]	[IT] Zandrew Bennet: And in his ravenous hatred, he found no peace; and with boiling blood he scoured the Clockwork plains seeking vengeance against the dark operators who had wronged him.
