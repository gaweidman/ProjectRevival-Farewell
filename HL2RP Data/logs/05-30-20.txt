[13:14:47]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: just c17 saying c8?
[13:14:53]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: or is it crazy over the top models
[13:14:56]	[OOC] Gordo Kin: Colors and their City number.
[13:15:02]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: ah
[13:15:05]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: Colors?
[13:15:24]	[OOC] Gordo Kin: Their chest is black, And they have some grey and blue.
[13:15:31]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: Da.
[13:15:45]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: Well I guess the C17 one is just more... well... known.
[13:15:55]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: because it looks like the traditional metrocop
[13:16:00]	[OOC] Gordo Kin: You can find the base CO8 MPF in the playermodels menu.
[13:16:14]	[OOC] Gordo Kin: If you want a more detailed look at them.
[13:16:26]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: ic it
[13:16:31]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: ehhhhhhhhhhhh
[13:16:39]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: too edgy in my opinion
[13:16:54]	[OOC] Gordo Kin: But this entire map is edgy.
[13:17:03]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: true
[13:17:05]	[OOC] Gordo Kin: So it blends in pretty well.
[13:17:11]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: we need to change the map soon.
[13:17:16]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: city 34 or industrial 17
[13:17:20]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: i dont like the edgy beta shit
[13:17:34]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: I can see the appeal but I just don't like it in my opinion
[13:17:44]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: "The True Citizen Conserves Valuable Oxygen"
[13:17:50]	[OOC] Gordo Kin: Yeah, But I think Q is going off of the minority.
[13:18:00]	[OOC] Gordo Kin: Most people somewhat like edgy beta shit.
[13:18:01]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: mhmm
[13:18:06]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: Yeah.
[13:18:13]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: Im a minority that likes retail
[13:18:30]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: Some of beta is cool tho, but people be sayin that it would've been better than the game we got, like bruh
[13:18:35]	[OOC] Gordo Kin: Yeha, I'm very neutral when it comes to Beta and retail.
[13:18:37]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: the playtesters didn't have fun.
[13:18:44]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: Valve was gonna change the game anyways
[13:18:57]	[OOC] Gordo Kin: It was for the best that they changed it.
[13:19:08]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: yet most beta lovers can't see that.
[13:19:47]	[OOC] Gordo Kin: Gamer, Once we get about 15 to 16 people on normally I do think we should change.
[13:20:03]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: Yes that would be gamer, Gamer.
[13:20:04]	[OOC] Gordo Kin: Or begin making a event to justify the change.
[13:20:10]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: and not just a nukke
[13:20:18]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: I say an uprising event would be pretty good.
[13:20:32]	[OOC] Gordo Kin: Do we have the Wastland in are Lore?
[13:20:33]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: similar to c17 uprising.
[13:20:41]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: Wasteland?
[13:20:44]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: Like uhhh
[13:20:46]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: Coast?
[13:20:48]	[OOC] Gordo Kin: It's beta shit
[13:20:52]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: Oh fuck
[13:20:55]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: no idea.
[13:21:03]	[OOC] Gordo Kin: More or less, The entire Ocean dried up.
[13:21:13]	[OOC] Gordo Kin: And now it's a massive wastland
[13:21:17]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: That's also in Retail kinda
[13:21:30]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: The Combine dried up the oceans alot where the water level has drastically gone down
[13:21:35]	[OOC] Gordo Kin: Kinda but not as impactful as the Wastland.
[13:21:46]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: tru
[13:21:56]	[OOC] Gordo Kin: I thinking of a portal storm event.
[13:22:04]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: Niice
[13:22:09]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: Xen infestation?
[13:22:19]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: Like they take over City 8
[13:22:44]	[OOC] Gordo Kin: Like the entire City is Completely taken over by Xen, Radiation and shit. So the Combine civilians and rebels have to band together and escape the city.
[13:22:59]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: that would be cool
[13:23:08]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: I don't really like City 8 but I do like the Outlands
[13:23:14]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: that it has
[13:23:44]	[OOC] Gordo Kin: And then the Cp's, Civilians, Rebel Etc Etc have to find another city or stay and be killed.
[13:24:37]	[OOC] Gordo Kin: Yeah, City 8 has a wonderful outlands.

[13:29:31]	[OOC] Joshua Stevens: the because the citadel is blocked by like every building
