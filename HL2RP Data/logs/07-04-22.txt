[22:16:35]	[OOC] Jackson Steere: remember that ol' work cycle thingy you were workin on in #dev-previews
[22:17:00]	[OOC] Jackson Steere: have automated work cycles or somethin hahaaa
[22:17:25]	[OOC] Jackson Steere: ye no AW when it first started out C11 / work cycles... the facemask / ppe I had to wear... the curfews 
[22:17:28]	[OOC] Jackson Steere: shit was awsome
[22:17:33]	[OOC] Jackson Steere: kept me interested all the way
[22:17:53]	[OOC] Jackson Steere: curfews was really interesting because it always kept you on your toes. and it was automated n everything
[22:18:22]	[OOC] Jackson Steere: I remember once during the curfew I ran upstairs on the rooftop of one of the appartments and sat there lookin at the stars while hiding from a bunch of scanners 
[22:18:43]	[OOC] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.07722: it is so funny, how during apartment raids is that all the people disconnect to survive
[22:18:44]	[OOC] Jackson Steere: while a bunch of CPs were patrolling the streets looking for any left over citizens walking about
[22:18:49]	[OOC] Jackson Steere: lamo
[22:18:59]	[OOC] Jackson Steere: I'd imagine that 
[22:19:28]	[OOC] Leona Geller: automated work cycles is one but that's not quite what i meanw
[22:19:31]	[OOC] Leona Geller: i ema nthat's a good kne
[22:19:32]	[OOC] Leona Geller: but like
[22:19:35]	[OOC] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.07722: i single shot, all the people disconnect, and all the new people that connect get screwed
[22:19:42]	[OOC] Leona Geller: i dunno, i feel like there's little motivation to do citizen to citizen interaction
[22:20:00]	[OOC] Jackson Steere: I had my fair share today, but I get what ya mean
[22:20:01]	[OOC] Leona Geller: like playing chess with somebody and your character ICly has anger issues so you swipe the pieces of the table when you're in check
[22:20:06]	[OOC] Leona Geller: well that's good at least
[22:20:17]	[OOC] Leona Geller: i genuinely think music might help, i need to loo kat your recommendations
[22:20:26]	[OOC] Leona Geller: in willard part of how i felt how i did was just because the music set the tone so well
[22:20:37]	[OOC] Jackson Steere: atmosphere does so much
[22:20:48]	[OOC] CCA.C17-UNION.i5.07722: the music is so good in willard

[22:25:31]	[OOC] Jackson Steere: I dunno... I feel like having automated work cycles sort of give citizens, atleast loyalist citizens an objective. Having an objective identical to the rest mind bring more citizen to citizen rp
