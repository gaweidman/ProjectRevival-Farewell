[11:31:08]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: so when your not talking in character, like when you are not talking as your character use .//
[11:31:14]	[LOOC] Chloe Cullen: Correct!
[11:31:27]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: like if you need to ask "hey how do i do insert ooc task here"

[11:31:48]	[LOOC] jimity: thanks
[11:32:13]	[LOOC] Chloe Cullen: As for your description, it varies how you want to go. I use rather basic descriptions over the heavily remarkable to allow more imagination of what I look like. 
[11:32:25]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: alright, for descriptions you really just have to describe what you first notice about your character
[11:32:40]	[LOOC] jimity: alright
[11:32:40]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: like how youd describe someone to the cops

[11:33:16]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: stuff like that
[11:33:25]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: just basic lore and rp customs

[11:34:06]	[LOOC] Chloe Cullen: We don't differ much. Our year is... 2006 I believe. Three years after the Combine invasion in 2003.
[11:34:22]	[LOOC] Chloe Cullen: I'm sure everything else is the same. The portal storms, the resonance cascade..
[11:34:47]	[LOOC] Chloe Cullen: But, alas, this is beta! BETA IS DIFFERENT AND BETTER
[11:34:50]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: just basic hl beta lore.
[11:35:01]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: yeah, more grim and deppressing.
[11:35:07]	[LOOC] Chloe Cullen: Children exist! They are enslaved. ANybody under 18 is a slave.
[11:35:11]	[LOOC] jimity: i know a tad from beta i'll look into it after this
[11:35:28]	[LOOC] Chloe Cullen: More synths and aliens are around! They are commonplace due to the presence of the Combine and the portal storms.
[11:35:39]	[LOOC] jimity: ok ok ok
[11:35:42]	[LOOC] Chloe Cullen: Earth's atmosphere has been altered. It is hardly survivable now.
[11:36:00]	[LOOC] jimity: thats why we have filters okay.
[11:36:14]	[LOOC] Chloe Cullen: It's more like Xen's atmosphere I believe. Plus the Combine have been harvesting resources like water.
[11:36:42]	[LOOC] Chloe Cullen: The reason why we still live is Breen I presume. The Combine are still seen as the good guys by many due to them saving us from the Portal Storms. 
[11:36:59]	[LOOC] Chloe Cullen: Most believe them to be evil, though evil doesn't really suit a race that spans entire universes.

[11:37:15]	[LOOC] jimity: so standered combine things got it.
[11:37:44]	[LOOC] Chloe Cullen: Yeah basically. The brutality is excusable. It's necessary to survive. Others believe we don't need the Combine. But the reality is we don't have a choice.
[11:37:58]	[LOOC] jimity: huh
[11:38:12]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: they ruined everything and now we need them to survive.
[11:38:24]	[LOOC] Chloe Cullen: /Xen/ ruined everything. Humans ruined it.
[11:38:51]	[LOOC] Chloe Cullen: Humans opened the portals and destroyed Earth. Combine put a stop to it and made the cities. A safe haven. It's easy to see how people like them.

[11:41:12]	[LOOC] Chloe Cullen: And they also had advanced future tech
[11:41:26]	[LOOC] Chloe Cullen: that basically sums up Beta aesthetic.
[11:41:41]	[LOOC] jimity: so modern tech in the medieval ages
[11:42:01]	[LOOC] Chloe Cullen: More like advanced super tech during the early 1900s and late 1800s

[11:42:48]	[LOOC] Chloe Cullen: Crime is commonplace, but the brutality of the Combine sees it ended quickly.
[11:43:03]	[LOOC] Chloe Cullen: Propaganda is as normal is not breathing the air.

[11:44:51]	[LOOC] jimity: how do i get food and water
[11:45:03]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: ration cycles and the local shops
[11:45:06]	[LOOC] Chloe Cullen: Ration times which really should be a machine instead imo
[11:45:19]	[LOOC] Chloe Cullen: I've never seen a cycle yet but I was also just homeless for three days
[11:45:44]	[LOOC] CCA.C08-UNION.i5.99915: most of the time i just buy 800 tokens worth of food and dump it around the city. along with filters so
