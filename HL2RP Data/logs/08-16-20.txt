[21:55:52]	[OOC] Journey Robertson: Like, first of all I don't think i'm any where near good enough for the rank in the first place (I honestly think i'm not even good enough for EpU)
[21:56:04]	[OOC] Gregory Smith: Whaat
[21:56:14]	[OOC] Gregory Smith: You're good enough for EpU and i think for DvL

[21:56:42]	[OOC] Gregory Smith: You almost asked him? Why?!
[21:57:30]	[OOC] Journey Robertson: I just don't think i'm worthy for the rank, I believe just being a SqL is where I would be perfectly skill matched.

[21:57:41]	[OOC] Gregory Smith: >:o
[21:58:21]	[OOC] Gregory Smith: I mean, i think you're perfect For EpU or DvL, i mean put limits if you think something is not good, but don't put limits if you don't have something that can ruin something of you
