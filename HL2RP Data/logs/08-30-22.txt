[19:31:01]	[ME] Tanya L. Fredrickson: In quick succession they would count out the bones in his back before moving to his lower back, finding it tense and seemingly a bit redder then an average back due to strain from standing all day, so feeling it softly they would locate the highly out of place bone and with one quick motion softly push it back into place with a resounding pop and a warm feeling in the area...
