[16:15:18]	[OOC] Lucius Strand: Yeah, C# I can stand.

[16:19:24]	[OOC] James Albright: it's nice exclusively because of its documentation. It's not great, but it's there, which blows it out of the water compared to NS and CW.

[16:21:11]	[OOC] Lucius Strand: They likely wrote both NS and CW without any documentation and then couldn't be asked to go through all of it and add it.
