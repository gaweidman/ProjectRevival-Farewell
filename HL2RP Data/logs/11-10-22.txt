[00:39:15]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: i will tell you

[00:39:58]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: and it's literally just a heavily modified
[00:40:04]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: version of liquid's gas system
[00:40:08]	[LOOC] Gregory: ah 
[00:40:12]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: like i just repurposed it to be global
[00:40:17]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: and then added in my own fil;ter thing
[00:40:23]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: the idea of having it build up over time
[00:40:23]	[LOOC] Gregory: bilwin put out a pretty good gas system that does exactly what im describing
[00:40:26]	[LOOC] Gregory: but not global
[00:40:27]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: it hadn't occured to me
[00:40:35]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: personally though i don't like that idea with gas
[00:40:43]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: it works a lot better on willard where you have xen sporesa
[00:40:49]	[LOOC] Gregory: god i fucking love their gas system
[00:40:50]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: i think that makes a lot more RP sense
[00:40:53]	[LOOC] Gregory: i didnt experience it firsthand
[00:40:56]	[LOOC] Gregory: but i know it's very nice
[00:40:57]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: it's really cool
[00:41:09]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: the xen spores idea was smart
[00:41:18]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: but yeah the idea of slow buildup never came to me
[00:41:24]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: but i wouldn't even do it for gas having that idea now
[00:41:24]	[LOOC] Gregory: not evne slow just
[00:41:26]	[LOOC] Gregory: a grace period
[00:41:33]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: that's ture
[00:41:39]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: slowing dow nthe damage would be nice too
[00:41:41]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: but a grace period
[00:41:45]	[LOOC] Gregory: or even just a warning on the filter time 
[00:41:49]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: i'll put that in my own suggestions channel
[00:41:56]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: that i cosndiered i'm pretty sure
[00:42:02]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: but it felt a little too gamey
[00:42:07]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: i felt like it would break immersion
[00:42:11]	[LOOC] Gregory: Metro Exodus does it really well
[00:42:19]	[LOOC] Gregory: it plays a little chime when your filter is about to run out, but it sbased on your watch
[00:42:24]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: that's smart
[00:42:27]	[LOOC] Gregory: since that game does not use many menus
[00:42:30]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: yeah, it would make more sense if you had a smart suit
[00:42:36]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: that owuld work well on the CWU suit
[00:42:39]	[LOOC] Gregory: yeah
[00:42:40]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: it would make sense
[00:42:45]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: also look at my eyes when i turn off my flashlight
[00:42:49]	[LOOC] Gregory: woah
[00:42:54]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: super small thing
[00:42:56]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: but so fucking cool
[00:43:01]	[LOOC] Gregory: question; why do respirators not use filters
[00:43:04]	[LOOC] Gregory: unintentional oversight?
[00:43:14]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: no, that was a genuine idea 
[00:43:27]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: the repsirators were added in originally to allow for more customization
[00:43:39]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: because i forgot when putting everybodfy in suits that, oh hey, you only have two appearance options
[00:43:43]	[LOOC] Gregory: invisible respirator for use in custom-placed respirator fr
[00:44:05]	[LOOC] Gregory: what i do for my character is i have the actual suit on, but i had DRD set my model to a normal citizen
[00:44:08]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: but then i figured "well, it might as well be better than a suit." so i figured the best way to be an upgrade other than allowing more customization was making it not take filters
[00:44:10]	[LOOC] Gregory: and i've PAC'd my respirator on
[00:44:19]	[LOOC] Gregory: so i get the aesthetics of the respirator but unfrotunately i have to get filters
[00:44:35]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: and then i figured i'd just make it more expensive and have it be more balanced with having a suit and keeping buying filters
[00:44:46]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: it wasn't a super great idea
[00:44:49]	[LOOC] Gregory: respirator is too cheap imo but also its a QoL thing and it shouldnt be super expensive
[00:44:51]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: i have very mixed feelings aobut it
[00:44:53]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: yeah
[00:44:59]	[LOOC] Gregory: the gas is intrusive as hell so an easy solution to it is very nice
[00:45:03]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: exactly
[00:45:06]	[LOOC] Gregory: the filters being cheap as fuck maket he suits nice
[00:45:11]	[LOOC] Gregory: make the suits bearable*
[00:45:14]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: bearable yeah
[00:45:18]	[LOOC] Andrew Cloverman: no i agree the suits aren't idea
