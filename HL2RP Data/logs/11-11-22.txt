He'd make sure that the mop would clean the dirty areas around the bench along with removing any dust and dragging them to the middle of the room, forming a small pile of dirtiness as he continued sweeping to the left and right. As he met the combine terminal, he'd make sure to clean the lower base of the terminal to make sure it was clean and dirt-free just like how any combine terminal should be. After all this, he'd sweep all the piled up filth and drag it away into the door that led to the room.
