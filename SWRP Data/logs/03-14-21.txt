[23:43:06]	[LOOC] ???: INTERROGATOR I MEANT
[23:43:18]	[LOOC] ???: i'm only slightly stupid
[23:43:26]	[LOOC] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Nah, this is an execution now.
[23:43:29]	[LOOC] Private TK-7134: lol, I was gonna do a quippy remark about that
[23:43:33]	[LOOC] ???: who's being executed though hmmmmm
[23:43:38]	[LOOC] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Me please
[23:43:45]	[LOOC] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': I'm bad at RP and deserve it.
[23:43:45]	[LOOC] ???: restraints.*
[23:44:26]	[ME] ???: would approach the rangetrooper and grab the knob controlling his head restraint. He slowly tightens it, creating an uncomfortably firm grip on his forehead.
[23:44:37]	[IT] ???: As he does this, his holster is just in reach of the Private.
[23:44:44]	[LOOC] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': PRIVATE
[23:44:48]	[LOOC] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': DO WHAT MUST BE DONE
[23:44:57]	[LOOC] Private TK-7134: Hmm...
[23:44:59]	[IT] ???: He can *just* reach the DC-17 in the holster, maybe even aim it.
[23:45:26]	[LOOC] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Is he performing?
[23:45:28]	[LOOC] ???: the action command is /me
[23:45:30]	[LOOC] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Oh shit
[23:45:30]	[LOOC] ???: he is
[23:45:47]	[ME] Private TK-7134: I'd reach for the gun, and aim it for the Guard's head
[23:46:07]	[IT] ???: He is none the wiser, too busy looking at the range trooper and trying to get a gauge of his pain.
[23:46:26]	[ME] Private TK-7134: after several seconds of getting the perfect aim, he'd fire a single shot
[23:47:12]	[IT] ???: Given that your hand wasn't exactly in the best aiming position, you're a little off, but it's a stroke of luck. You shoot him right in the neck. He falls, choking.
[23:47:16]	[ME] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Flinches from the shot (due to it being near his head) and simply stays quiet trying to listen for any other footsteps.
[23:47:45]	[LOOC] Private TK-7134: how restrained am I rn?
[23:47:47]	[ME] ???: would reach for his comlink, but is too busy shaking from the shock caused by putting a hole right in his neck.
[23:48:02]	[LOOC] ???: Wrists, ankles, scalp.
[23:48:12]	[LOOC] ???: there's a way to free yourself
[23:48:30]	[ME] ???: dies.

[23:48:56]	[OOC] ???: if you can get it, you get a cookie
[23:49:15]	[OOC] Private TK-7134: I like cookies
[23:50:15]	[ME] Private TK-7134: would shoot one of the wrist restraints of the Sergeant, aiming it carefully
[23:50:29]	[LOOC] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': We are too dumby for doing this right so time to shoot the locks instead.
[23:50:32]	[IT] ???: A hit! It's broken open. Close shot, though. Risky.
[23:50:40]	[LOOC] ???: that's literally the right way
[23:50:44]	[LOOC] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Bruh
[23:50:56]	[LOOC] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': I was expecting a smarter way out
[23:50:58]	[OOC] Private TK-7134: bruh
[23:51:09]	[OOC] ???: there's a very smart way of doing it now but i'm the GM so i can't say :)
[23:51:20]	[ME] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': With one hand freed he unlocks his other restraints and gets the fuck out of the chair.
[23:51:25]	[OOC] ???: oh yeah
[23:51:25]	[OOC] ???: that's
[23:51:29]	[OOC] ???: yeah that's right

[23:51:37]	[IT] ???: Yep, that works.
[23:51:45]	[ME] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Starts freeing the TK.
[23:52:09]	[ME] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Grabs the body of the Guard and searches it for the Comlink and any gun he could have.
[23:52:35]	[OOC] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Anything?
[23:52:46]	[IT] ???: The comlink is working, but tuned to the wrong frequency. As the other comlinks, you don't see a way to change the frequency. Crummy, cheap model, you guess. He also has another DC-17. He was fighting akimbo.
[23:52:56]	[OOC] ???: both of you should have the DC-17
[23:53:01]	[OOC] Sergeant RT-9824 ''Bulwark'': Coolio
